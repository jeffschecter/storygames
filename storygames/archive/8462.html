Well, a recent thread got me to thinking. How did I come to the belief that all games are toolkits for play/all RPG play is customization of written material/and so on?  Yeah yeah, everyone's sick of hearing it. But actually I haven't told the story behind it before. So maybe you'll be interested. If you're not that's okay too.<br/><br/>Return with me now to the THRILLING DAYS OF YESTERYEAR<br/><br/>1989. Solidarnosc. Ted Bundy electrocuted. Salman Rushdie bounty. Keating Five. Batman.  Pete Rose banned from baseball.  George Bush is President, he bought cocaine across the street. Alien Nation. Quantum Leap. Baywatch. Seinfeld. COPS. Doogie Howser. Berlin Wall falls. <br/><br/>And young JDCorley attends 9th grade. High school. Hangs out with his gamer pals. We play D&amp;D.  Of course we do.  We each have a stable of 3-4 characters that we bring out for various things. At one point we were over at a peripheral friend's house. We all have brought a random character and as it turns out we all brought thieves.  (I think one guy had a houseruled thief-acrobat.)  We had some reservations, but nobody was willing to back down on the character they brought - they were all "legal" characters, weren't they? Nobody had a problem when I played this character last week, right, so why now?  We go through the scenario and it's a blast in the same way that watching silent comedies is a blast. People run into each other and fall down and it's funny.  We were constantly laying traps, sneaking up, yelling like idiots to draw the monsters down into the traps, then ambushing them. And robbing each other.<br/><br/>At the end of the session we were hanging around yacking and someone mentioned "That was more like the Godfather than Lord of the Rings" and everyone laughed, it was such a ridiculous notion. <br/><br/>At home later, I started thinking, "what would it be like to run our D&amp;D game more like the godfather and less like Lord of the Rings?"  I even made a little list: family, established loyalty, outside threats, all thieves of various sorts...and I discovered the alignment system actually provided a lot of juice for plots based on backstabbery and loyalty - the lawful evil guy won't break his word to his underlings and won't ever rat to the cops but the neutral evil guy will every time he thinks he can get away with it and gain something from it. I drew up a few outlines for potential D&amp;D crime games and set them aside for the future.<br/><br/>But it was at that game that I realized something - we had made virtually no changes to the rules of D&amp;D. The only thing, the tiniest only thing we had done was to ignore the admonition about a balanced party mix, and that admonition said (basically) "just a thought, do what you want!" after it, so we didn't even feel like we were ignoring the game text at all.  (This was super important to us because we were 9th grade males and therefore idiots.)  "And," I reasoned, "they really all were completely 'street-legal' D&amp;D characters."  Nobody had cheated, nobody had made their character "wrong" in any way, they just all happened to be thieves. Nobody had colluded to make them all thieves, but so what if we had? We were still playing D&amp;D, we were still following all the rules...<br/><br/>Yet the difference in experience between that and "regular" D&amp;D play was so pronounced that I felt like I was playing in an entirely different game.  Something so outrageously different that it wasn't even in the same ballpark. We spoke differently, planned differently, played differently in every single way.<br/><br/>Because I was a scientifically minded young lad, I wondered if this could be replicated.<br/><br/>So the next time we planned a get-together, I said "everyone bring your wizards, or make a wizard" and we did an all-wizard game about a dastardly insidious demonic presence at a beloved mentor's spellslinging academy. And holy shit, it was different AGAIN.<br/><br/>Now I'm really starting to wonder.  Why the hell is "regular" D&amp;D regular and why is this "irregular" D&amp;D irregular? And then I started to think back to our "regular" D&amp;D and compared a game I ran to a game my friend Brian ran. In my game the main badguy was a dragon - he had a few minions and a lot of magical protections but basically, it was all preparation and setup for One Giant Fight, comic book style.  Brian had run a game in which there wasa giant horde of orcs and our characters' job was to blind the horde by wiping out scouts and outliers. (We incorporated a new goal of spreading disinformation to the horde as well based on what players were trying to do.)  And those two games were completely different in feel and in play and it had nothing to do with the rules.  The rules didn't change (or if they did, it wasn't remotely as significant as the changes in play experience)...so even "regular" D&amp;D was so amazingly different with a different set of players that it was actually more different than a game where we actually changed a rule or two.<br/><br/>More, as they say, later.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187242/#Comment_187242" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T13:58:20+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  1:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey JD,<br/>Just so you know, I agree that all play is customization, all games are toolkits.

You can pretty easily distinguish betwen "toolkit" games and more focused games. D&amp;D 3.0 or GURPS requires a lot of customization to make it work well for your group (whether the players acknowledge it or not), but Dogs in the Vineyard (for example) doesn't. (Although people definitely DO enjoy customizing that game, such customization is "out of scope" in this sense). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, all play is customized, but the degree to which that takes place is significant.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this is probably also one of those "Yeah, everyone knows that" points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187259/#Comment_187259" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T14:35:41+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  2:35PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, um, Jason...<br/><br/>1.

You are saying a true thing.  You are not dumb.  I know you were plenty worried about that, but let me put that to rest for you.<br/><br/>Second, this... Given that you are stating something that few could disagree with, let's mix it up a bit.  This is not to contradict anything you wrote in your first post.  It is to expand an idea -- which is where you and I would most likely disagree.  I think it might be perceived as a semantics thing -- but it's the Internet, we're <i>typing</i>, of <i>course</i> it'll be a semantics thing.  But it is the point where I say, "Yes," to your observations.... "and...."<br/><br/>It depends on what your meaning of the word "rules" are.<br/><br/>In <i>Sorcerer</i> (and I'm stuck on <i>Sorcerer</i> right now because of Play Sorcerer and my brain is too deep into to get out, so apologies up front!) part of the game play is to define Humanity.  To define Demons.  To define what Lore is.  This procedure is part of the rules of <i>Sorcerer</i>.  The game simply does not work if you do not do this.<br/><br/>So. That is part of how you play Sorcerer.  Doing that thing is part of the game, part of the rules, part of the system.<br/><br/>When I read your examples of the Godfather version of D&amp;D (which sounds awesome) and the spellslinger academy D&amp;D (which sounds awesome), there is, of course, no way I can't think of you adding certain rules to the game to make the game work in the same fashion as <i>Sorcerer</i>.  (Or, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, or the specific procedures of <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> or <i>Polaris</i> or whatever... Again.  I'm referencing Sorcerer right now simply because I can rattle on about it fast.  Not because it is unique in these matters.)<br/><br/>And when I say "same fashion" I mean <i>the exact same fashion</i>.<br/><br/>I would say clearly you changed the rules.  You dismiss the limitations on classes out of hand as not that big a deal.  But the truth is, and I'm guessing here, the combat challenges the PCs confronted were not the standard Gelatinous Cubs and 2-7 kobolds young adventurers usually face in a dungeon crawl.<br/><br/>Of course one doesn't have to do a dungeon crawl.  You could do anything.  (And people did!)  But you've already revealed that there was a specific situation and setting and types of characters.  I'm pretty sure you built the challenges with all wizard group in mind.<br/><br/>So, when you write, "Something so outrageously different that it wasn't even in the same ballpark. We spoke differently, planned differently, played differently in every single way," I can't be surprised.  To me... and that's to me, and I really have no -- NO -- agenda to get you change your mind, it's because you WERE playing a different game.  Because where you draw the line on what makes one game one thing and where I draw my line are at two different places.<br/><br/>Yes, your PCs were street legal.  And yes, you resolved a punch or saving throw with the roll of a d20.  But the other stuff around those things set up certain parameters and needs that you respected to make the "game" work.<br/><br/>In other words, you rummaged around in a big trunk of "stuff" -- pulled the bits and pieces you wanted, and made a tight, focused, Forge game.  You wanker!  How depressing is that!<br/><br/>Am I dumb because I think this?  Luckily, I am too dumb to care!<br/><br/>But really, seriously, I'll completely understand if you don't buy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187269/#Comment_187269" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T15:09:10+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  3:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SO I brought this up to my pals and they all said the same thing "DUHHH" and pointed to the huge factor in this wide variation of D&amp;D play: the GM.  We'd had some difficulties with shifting from GM to GM before, and me (the only habitual GM in the group), "backseat" GMing some games.<br/><br/>To them, the variety in play experience was a hundred percent attributable to variety in GMing styles. "But you did different things in the all-thief game." I insisted. "Even if you weren't GMing. YOU played different."  Well, that was true.  But the other stuff I was talking about, the difference in play attributable to content (big dragon fight vs. orc horde guerilla stuff), that was all GM stuff, because after all, the GM was the one that set up that content.<br/><br/>Had me there.  I had picked the dragon and Brian had picked the orc horde and reaaaally the other players at the table, if you nailed me down and forced me to choose, had not done much to contribute to that.  Their different play experiences and activities were reacting to something the GM had done, not something D&amp;D had done.<br/><br/>I tacked it up to the GM and really didn't think much more about it until Vampire came along 2 years later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187272/#Comment_187272" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T15:17:04+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  3:17PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Yes, your PCs were street legal.

We had dived into that big toolchest and built a game with what we found, yes. And I agree with you that some of the things we pull out of the toolchest are inherently built for customization and don't work without it, Humanity in Sorcerer's a great example, so are all the decisions given in the Dungeon Master's Guide of various editions of D&amp;D (some better than others, of cuorse.) But my eventual belief (the last reel of this narrative) is that this is what we do with the Sorcerer toolchest, and the Dogs in the Vineyard toolchest, and <i>even the Rifts toolchest, </i>with all that gunk leaking out the bottom - someone spilled something in there months ago - that there is no other way to make any sense of what we do in RPGs.<br/><br/>(And actually the all-thief game WAS a dungeon crawl, and the gelatinous cube WAS a big (and hilarious) problem, thank you for reminding me of it, the memory of the cube fight is very clear now, right down to the players shouting "NOOOOOOOooo!" when the GM said 'gelatinous cube' for the first time.  I believe the free-running battle ranged over 2 levels and had 3 wandering monster checks come up with 'more goblins' before it was over. The all-wizard dungeon crawl as part of the demonic plot was less hilarious in part because, you're right, I designed it as an all-wizard dungeon crawl.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187273/#Comment_187273" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T15:23:07+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  3:23PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

If they *want* to hack, it's not like it's locked away, but it *will run* without hacking.<br/><br/>The majority of this "customization" is either superficial or *is what the people doing it enjoy, in itself*.<br/><br/>Secondly. The vast majority of game-hacking done out there in the wild is done on a trial and error basis. Because not even the authors of the text actually understand or have put in that text how the darn thing works. One really major advantage of these "overly rigid" systems is that they're great labs, because they have very few moving parts and illustrate a narrow set of principles really well. If you take what you learn by manipulating that specialized, narrow set of parts back to your toolbox games and use it to hack better, I don't think there's many designers who'd shed a tear.<br/><br/>Now I'm going shut up and eagerly wait to see what Corley has to say next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187338/#Comment_187338" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T21:50:15+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  9:50PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Oh, wait.<br/><br/>What about XP.

I think through the misty tendrils of time we handled it exactly "normally", which led to the wizard-only segment producing less XP than your typical hardcore dungeon crawl (the "thief" segment too, just with more giggling) but that was also true of any of our "roleplaying-heavy" scenarios, or "silly" dungeon crawls where we were farting around with illusions and strange magical devices and Monty Python routines.  I DO remember plenty of sessions where we got a lot less XP at the end than we normally would.  We saw a highly variable XP award as being pretty much okay with us, since 1 - we didn't really think that much about why XP was the way it was, 2 - we still had huge amounts of fun in the scenarios where we weren't earning as much XP, and 3 - it sort of fit our "it is only BATTLE that truly makes you stronger, BATTLE AND GOLD" campaign world/whatever ethos (it was Greyhawk AND Forgotten Realms...but I'm getting ahead of myself.) It wasn't until much later that we, as grownups, realized we had forgotten "AND CHICKS" too.<br/><br/>My router crashed and died a death so spectacular that not even a full factory reset could save it. So expect updates later, much later (except when I can sneak on my wife's computer - how times they do change).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

But there are different people who make it their hobby to transform these things into toolkits. There are even websites dedicated to hacking ikea furniture. I definitely consider roleplaying to have a huge amount of customization built in. And the more transparent the working parts of a thing, the easier it is to turn it into a toolkit. It's easier to use a desktop computer as a tool kit rather than a laptop computer. Most things are toolkits in certain hands and in certain contexts. RPGs are potentially unique for their high level of transparency, without you they are incomplete, and their potential output is almost infinite in diversity. More so than the basic interactivity required to play a video game. They require creativity to do anything meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Like, who decides on the final draft of the ongoing string of events in the game? What's the process? What are we agreeing is the bottom line? Well, we can draw that bottom line in all kinds of ways: We can agree it's up to the GM, or that it's a group consensus thing (even though it probably still resides with an alpha player), or whatever.<br/><br/>Intersecting with that you've got credibility. Even though everyone has agreed to X arrangement (verbal agreement maybe, or implied by playing a particular game), in their dark little hearts they really <i>believe</i> Y: <i>I know we said it's up to the GM, but I would rather look to the rules for an answer.</i> Hence you've got the bad kind of rules-lawyering.<br/><br/>I really think that's the fundamental disconnect between the Jason approach (every game is a toolkit, every act of play is customization) and the shall-we-say fundamentalist approach (RPGs are games like any other, intended play experience emerges when you follow the rules).<br/><br/>For me at least, my personal authority/credibility settings vary by person and by game.<br/><br/>Some games I find to be low-credibility games. I first try the rules as written, find they don't work or they don't produce the play I expect/want it to (or that I've been told it <i>will</i> produce), and then I start mucking around. Full disclosure: I find indie-designed games to have a low level of credibility for me.<br/><br/>Now to complicate things: These self-same indie-designed games, the ones I grant low credibility? They're written in a way that assumes the rules will be granted a high level of <i>authority</i>: follow the RAW, the engine is so tightly integrated that customization is (deliberately?) difficult, etc. The problem is, when you've got authority without credibility, the whole thing falls apart.<br/><br/>Anyway, my two cents.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187742/#Comment_187742" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T09:55:16+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  9:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually I lied, I'm not going to talk about Vampire just yet, because all this narrativitalkingness has brought up another set of memories from deep in the depths.  <br/><br/>Man, I played a lot of D&amp;D back then.  I played most of it at school or at my best friend's house because my mom thought it was satanic.<br/><br/>And I actually went with my best friend to a convention one time!  I don't even remember how we got there, it was before we were old enough to drive, and we played with this Santa-Claus-looking limburger-cheese-smelling RPGA motherfucker.  Now here we were a couple of fourteen year old jerkoffs and we thought D&amp;D was something you did while you were screwing around, cracking jokes, talking in funny voices, yelling battle cries, cackling with glee as we dished out damage, and hanging out, but for him it was Serious Fucking Business and we lasted about ten minutes with him before he was yelling at us to straighten up and "play the game", which we were highly confused by because that's exactly what we were doing.  Many years later I realized that we actually probably were holding this guy back from getting some kind of prize. We didn't actually grasp the competitive aspect of the tournament. We just thought we were there to play!<br/><br/>This wasn't the last time I played with an "RPGA dude" either. We had one come to our group for a while (transfer student, military kid) and in contrast to cheese-smelling-Santa, he was just as open to goofing around even in competitive situations as we were, but never ever spoke in character, it was all "Elberon tells you he wants some jerky".  Which was weird because we always switched back and forth.  He told tales of the RPGA that sounded great, but again, they all sounded different. He even took me to a RPGA-only event and the game we played in was a lot more like our house game than it was like Santa Claus' ideal "shut up and cast your spell" game.<br/><br/>"What the fuck is going on here?" thought young JD, not for the last time in this story. "The RPGA actually has real-live rules that are about making sure every game is as close to each other as possible. And they're still as different as night and day."<br/><br/>I started getting sensitized to differences in game experiences.  I noticed that if one person showed up who was comfortable with talking in a funny voice, everyone was comfortable with it, but if there wasn't that one person, nobody would do it.  I noticed that two Monty Python fans was a very different experience than one or none.  I could tell the difference between people who had read Tolkein and who hadn't, and people who had read Conan, and who hadn't, and people who had read The Screwtape Letters, and who hadn't.  (It was one of the most popular books in our group and all our devils and demons were super smooth and...now that I think of it most of them actually wrote letters!)<br/><br/>It got to the point where I could tell the difference between a dungeon crawl run by GM A with players B, C and D and a dungeon crawl run by GM A with players B, C, and E.  Virtually all the actual game rules were exactly the same, but the experience...I started to see more and more differences everywhere I looked. And I could draw judgment calls on each of the differences!  I liked funny voices but also liked when we used them for non-comedy things too. I was cool with "Elberon says..." for inconsequential conversations or when we just needed to get a piece of information to get us to the dungeon.  I thought just saying "standard operating procedure" when we came to a door or a new stretch of dungeon corridor as a shortcut for searching for traps, listening for ambushes, and so on, was a cop-out.  ("Either you think something's there, in which case you should describe what you're doing, or you don't, in which case you're fucked if something's there.")  And each of these things provided a positive or a negative to the experience - and if enough positives lined up you had a great time and if enough negatives lined up you had a shitty time - all under the same ruleset, all doing "the same thing"...what the fuck was happening here?<br/><br/>I think a long time before anyone ever said 'social contract!' I was getting some idea that social aspects of gaming had a big impact, but it was more than just social aspects.  If we all showed up and wanted to fight, we fought a lot.  If we all showed up and wanted to work on our strongholds and describe our hot half-elf girlfriends, the game was about castles and charmeuses.  Those decisions were all about the content of the game, which was so broad as to permit all kinds of things, and which, naturally, we pushed even further.<br/><br/>Going to branch out a bit in next update to some other games. Some of which are not actually RPGs.

Actually there's a lot of very weird things about Battletech if you look back on it from the distance of 20 years. Battletech is a very Western look at what is essentially a Japanese genre - giant robots fighting.  So much so that it is entirely divorced from the source material in virtually every way.  There's no teenagers with colorful hair. There's no quasi-mystical hoohah.  There's no familial drama (in the game itself). <br/><br/>It also was the first game where I was struck with the disconnect between "color" and "game".  Now, I still believe today that in the vast majority of cases the two are intertwingled so thoroughly that it's folly to try to pull them apart.  And even Battletech would not have been Battletech if it had giant monsters fighting instead of giant robots fighting.  But Battletech has an enormously detailed universe, with complex, well-written military histories of this far-future set of wars that crisscross the galaxy, and none of it, <i>none of it</i> matters even in the least to play.  Even when they finally came out with the Mechwarrior RPG, the only thing that mattered was the mission, the scenario, the campaign (in the military sense of the word).  This fascinating universe was made but nothing happened with it.  Keep that in mind, because young JD sort of forgot it and he ran into a lot of problems because he forgot it.<br/><br/>What I wanted to talk about with Battletech was some of the scenarios we played out.<br/><br/>Now, Battletech can be played in many different ways, here are the various variables that you can use:<br/><br/>* Map - is it preset by the scenario, picked by one side or the other, or randomly selected?<br/>* Forces - are they preset by the scenario, selected within a certain "tonnage" (i.e. your side has 1000 tons of giant robots, you can pick 3 100 ton robots, 4 25-ton robots, and so on), are they selected within a certain "price" (including building your own robot using the price structure given), or some combination<br/>* Victory conditions - are they preset by the scenario or just "wipe everyone on the other side out"<br/><br/>And one day while hanging around playing Battletech I devised the smallest, cheapest mech known to mankind.  Codenamed: The Putz, it clocked in at 10 tons (actually the parts were lighter, but the rules required that 10 tons is the minimum), it had a single gun and (a little fuzzy on this) I think it ran on an internal combustion engine (all other mechs used a fusion plant).  The Putz II was a 15 ton mech, had a fusion engine, and a giant gun that, upon firing once, would overheat and destroy the mech carrying it.  I decided I would use these two designs in the upcoming 500-ton-limit battle.  After double and triple checking my math, the other players agreed that the Putz was a legal design.  When, in my first turn, I moved 30 mechs onto the field and critical-hitted 7 times (just due to raw damage output, each successful hit from a Putz I barely hurt the target but there were so many firing that criticals were crippling them), the cries and bawwwww-ing of my good friends were sweet sweet music to my 15 year old ears. I had invented the Zerg rush long before Starcraft was ever invented. kekekekekekeke<br/><br/>But on the way home that night, because I had always thought of Battletech as a fascinating universe and one I would love to roleplay in at some point (if I could but figure out what the fuck to DO there), I started comparing the Putz to some of the things that had happened in our D&amp;D game.  The Putz was "street-legal".  There was no doubt about that.  It had been repeatedly rechecked as I swarmed across the battlefield murdering everything (I'd say "like a swarm of locusts" but actually as I recall, Locusts were pretty cool semi-light mechs!)  Just as the "group of thieves" was street-legal.  Just as all the differing ways to play D&amp;D were "legal".  <br/><br/>Even in Battletech, where inputs were highly constrained, in fact, where your input was limited to "what giant robots do you pick to fight", I had created something that completely changed the entire feeling of the game, the entire experience of play.<br/><br/>I then thought about chess. At least in chess, I thought, the experience of play is always the same no matter which moves you make. You're just making moves on a chessboard. Even in Battletech you're imagining the missiles going off and the lasers going off (we made laser noises when we shot lasers - did you?)  but chess is so abstract and SO limited that the experience has to be of the same "type".  It can't be that different.<br/><br/>And that was true.<br/><br/>Until I actually started playing a lot of chess.<br/><br/>See you next update.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187750/#Comment_187750" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T10:45:05+00:00" title="January 12, 2009 10:45AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS - I lost the battle with the swarm of Putzes because in round 2 all the other players, including some nominal allies of mine, decided they needed to have an "iron alliance" against me and they wiped out the remaining waves.

I'll try to get something in this afternoon. But one sentence that stuck with me even over the long weekend was that over the course of these processes I was becoming "sensitized" to differences in play experience.  I'm guessing that a fair degree of the resistance to the idea that all play is customization comes from people who do not have that sensitivity.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, it is a matter of taste. I can tell the difference between Cholula hot sauce, Tapatio hot sauce, Tabasco hot sauce, and Poblano hot sauce, and explain each of them, but my wife really could care less, to her they are all "too hot".  So to some degree the designer who responds angrily to my post about how I brutally misused their game (again, I'm giving away part of the story here) isn't hypocritical when they don't respond angrily to a gentle young lamb who did just as much customization in play as I did - they just don't see the contributions that player has made as being significant compared to the contributions I made.  Their idea of "What My Game Is" is broad enough to encompass the other fellow, but not JDCorley. (It is never, by the way, broad enough to encompass me.)<br/><br/>More later on.

A week's break, I hope you all have your bike helmets fastened to avoid brain damage because I'm back to talk about VAMPIRE!!<br/><br/>I already did a fucking huge thread about my experiences with Vampire <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6444" rel="nofollow">here</a> and I always invite questions about the game there, because it's completely great, but for the purposes of this thread probably the most interesting thing was the urging, even in Vampire 1ed, to pick a "theme" for the game.  This theme was literary at just about the junior high level, or the level of the potboiler horror-romance novels that the game approximated.  It wasn't required to be deep, it wasn't required to be truly insightful, but it was deadly clear from the game that you were meant to take it seriously.<br/><br/>This was a new axis of customization I hadn't seen before.  A Vampire game with a theme of "old vs. new" would be a very different thing than a Vampire game with a theme of "family crises".  By picking a theme, explaining it to the players, and working it into the details of the campaign and the game world, the GM could create the stages for very different sorts of play experiences.  When, sneakily, I changed the theme to "splatterpunk chainsaws", and discovered that the game functioned just as well, I was both highly impressed with the product - it still worked when I fucked with it - and my own cleverness.  Of course I was in the 11th grade. It didn't take much for me to impress myself then.<br/><br/>The essays at the back of the book on how to use the game were also helpful, though in a different way.  See, by this time we had developed, if not fully and not explicitly, how we liked our games and house rules of a half dozen sorts.  The essays in the back, contradictory as they were, conclusively put the last nail in the coffin containing the dead idea that the designer had some clue about the best way for our group to game, because for the most part we had no interest in the sorts of things the designers went on about. LARP? Haha, right. (Yet we did cheesy accents with gusto!)  Multiple GMs? Uh, there's another way to do things?<br/><br/>But let's be clear - I liked Vampire (I still do) - I liked the game these people had made, I enjoyed what they had given me and used it and used it and used it.  The only possible conclusion was that game designers were a bit like idiot savants.  They were capable of making really cool things but incapable of recognizing what was cool about them or using them in cool ways, or at least, incapable of doing these things as well as WE did.<br/><br/>Now at this point our group is still pretty insular. We got a larger proportion of girls involved when Vampire came out, but it wasn't a big change since we had always had <i>some</i> females in the group.  But there's not really a lot of friction because we're all good friends and game-related sparks just seem silly to us compared to friendship and camraderie.<br/><br/>I should also note that compared to a lot of people's experiences in other threads, our high school experience as geeks/nerds was quite positive. We had a top football player in our Battletech group, though he didn't really care about RPGs, and the head cheerleader (and valedictorian) was an eager contributor to the Vampire game 'behind the scenes' because she loved Anne Rice and had all kinds of cool ideas for it, and in general, although we had cliques in the school, people were, overall, eager to recognize the strengths of fellow students and help them out. Another football player I remember was tight friends with the nerdiest of the sci-fi nerds because they both had a dream of becoming Star Trek writers and they were constantly talking about Trek all the time.  I helped a track star with her math and not to get into her pants (she was a semi-out lesbian), but because I thought she was an interesting person.  So we never really had problems recruiting people interested in "what those D&amp;D people are doing after school" for a few sessions, and we never felt we had to hide what we were doing at school.  (The super-conservative parents had by that time given up on controlling us/begun to trust us with our futures.)<br/><br/>I bring this up primarily because I want to emphasize that we had a very socially functional group, and as a result, we didn't really have a lot of the trust/force issues a lot of others might have experienced that led them to grip onto the designer's words or intent more than we did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190480/#Comment_190480" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T18:02:50+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  6:02PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am thinking more and more that that is absolutely key.

Better than the last chapter, it's THE NEXT CHAPTER, entitled....<br/><br/><b>THE INTARNET</b> I mean the Internet<br/><br/>I went off to college and discovered Usenet. Yes, you can find embarrassing posts from me there. So much for aspirations of public office!<br/><br/>I am usually very skeptical of people identifying big turning points in gaming history. I snicker at them, I make nasty comments about them, in prediction threads I always say "nothing will change" and I am righter than everyone else, and more of a killjoy, every time.  So I am going to be a hypocrite here, and identify something that changed not just for me, but for everyone:<br/><br/><i>Usenet was the first time that game developers and their audience had a continuous conversation.</i><br/><br/>In the past, we had talked only through letters columns, or the 5-10 minutes we could buttonhole them at conventions.  All those "let me tell you about my character" conversations were actually leading up to something, some kind of commentary on the game they had created - and the reason that they were so painful was that the developer was aghast at the content the players had made and did not want to hear about it.  So it was inevitable that when an actual conversation took place that it would immediately go badly.  Game writers hated what people had done with their games - they had hated it all along - they just didn't know they hated it because there was no means of communicating it.<br/><br/>Usenet was the first place that a sustained conversation could take place and <i>everyone fucking hated everything everyone was doing with the game.</i>  Developers flamed gamers who posted "fixes" to games.  They harangued people who misunderstood sections.  Gamers yelled at developers for "mistakes".  There was one point at which I was in the killfile of every single White Wolf writer who posted on Usenet, because I was relentlessly posting about White Wolf games in a way they didn't like at all.  Even setting variations ("Wouldn't it be cool to play Changeling in a Cyberpunk 2020-style world where intellectual property and thus creativity are tightly controlled by media conglomerates?") were greeted with howls of frustration and anger from the ones that had actually written Changeling.<br/><br/>Nobody had yet figured out that someone who constantly posts about a weakness in your game and all the things they did to fix, avoid or subvert it <i>is a giant fan of your game who has sent you a pile of money.</i>  Developers expected consumers.  What they discovered on Usenet were handypeople.  "Thanks for the hammer and the instructions on how to build a doghouse, I made this great birdhouse with it!" "Birdhouses are lame, check out this sweet go-cart, by the by, the hammer is not so great!" "EXCUSE ME IT IS A DOGHOUSE HAMMER YOU ARE ALL STUPID I HATE YOU SHUT UP".<br/><br/>Usenet was the first time I realized that game designers themselves have no idea what makes their game any good. They love parts of their game that are stupid.  They think parts of their game are really important when I could care less about them.  They completely overlook badass stuff.<br/><br/>And the reason for this is that the things in a game that make it good are different for every group for which it is good - let alone the ones for which it is, on net, bad.  The only possible value in a game is in play.  That is the only place it matters, and play is so different, with such different goals and such different inputs, that the actual game text is a relatively blunt instrument. It's a canvas and paint, a typewriter, and it makes a big difference whether you're writing Moby Dick, or just, ya know, Ivanhoe. (Yes, I also learned Laurie Anderson in college.)<br/><br/>Everything that has happened on the Internet since Usenet has proved me righter and righter and righter until my rightness shines like a burning beacon.  In fact today, the smart developers will encourage people to post about how they fixed the game for their groups.  They'll encourage setting customization and campaign-specific discussions.  What if someone else runs into the same snag? What if someone else wants something similar in their game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193416/#Comment_193416" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T10:28:39+00:00" title="February 20, 2009 10:28AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recognize that you're being deliberately over-the-top, but ... taken seriously, what's the point of ever publishing a game at all, then, other than as a collection of bits? If there's no point in putting content or procedure into the text, since they're all home-built anyhow, what's left?<br/><br/>Really, I suspect that the inveterate tinkers are just the most <b>vocal</b> partisans of a game. And often, what they're really being partisan about is their White Whale - the game in their head, that they really want the game in the text to be. Meanwhile, an awful lot of players out there in the wild are just trying to reproduce something more or less like the game that's described in the text. They're the ones who care about the text - because they want a recipe, not a bits box.<br/><br/>It's rather like looking to Internet enthusiasts to understand technology. If you do that, you become convinced that it's all horribly arcane - that tweaked-out, hyper-customized, state-of-the-art tools are <i>absolutely necessary</i> for every possible purpose.

Clarification:<br/><br/>The important discovery of Usenet was that empirically, practically, in the real world, not in some theoretical "wild", everyone hated each other's games.  We should have known this because "let me tell you about my character" was a hilarious joke even before that, but we didn't realize what the joke was based on.  The reason the guy who insists on telling you about his lame character is funny is because you think his character is lame and he is terrible, and he loves his character and thinks he's fascinating.  That whole experience is only cringe-worthy because what that guy has created with the same thing you really like is something you really hate.<br/><br/>Now just a smidge of argument:<br/><br/>"What's the point of ever publishing a game at all"? This is a giant red herring. Nothing in the "all play is customization" story has anything to say at all about game publishing or its value.  Clearly there is some value to it!  But the connection between what is valuable (or horrible) in what is played and what is published is a hell of a lot more tenuous than most people allow.  If someone decides to follow something they see in the text, fine, but that's their decision and the good or ill that follows comes from their decision, not from the dead hand of some distant designer. And amazingly, they will often still get it wrong and more amazingly still, they will often still have a great time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193421/#Comment_193421" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T11:14:21+00:00" title="February 20, 2009 11:14AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I recognize that you're being deliberately over-the-top, but ... taken seriously, what's the point of ever publishing a game at all, then, other than as a collection of bits? If there's no point in putting content or procedure into the text, since they're all home-built anyhow, what's left?</blockquote>\nI think there's a lot to do with putting procedure into text. Here's two sub-concerns though:<br/><br/>1) The writer(s) add procedure to their game. "This is the way it should be played", in their eyes. That's still a foundation from which to build from. If Vampire came out as just a collection of rules, without the evocative fanfic or those pretty little pictures at the corners of the corebook which showed the tale of a Babylonian Vampire King and his mistress, then there would have been NOTHING to work from. That leaves the user with "what do I DO with this?", which is bad.<br/><br/>But, along the way a reader will read the rules, setting etc and find their own way, build their own paths off the trail. What J is saying is that nowadays people seem to be ok with it (or perhaps grudgingly ok), and the best thing to do is encourage it, as these are usually people who have bought and are actually playing the game. But back in the day, designers got upset when the way the game was played didn't match up to their ideal of how it should be played (and whether the designer was actually playing the game regularly is another question, but I won't do that here). Even though Gamer X bought the game and all of its supplements, has a table filled with enthusiasts who also play, promulgate and purchase, they were still upset that their Vampire was Guns and Broads in Seedy Chi-Town instead of Personal Horror Masterpiece Theater.<br/><br/>2) (not addressed yet): Other times, I think that designers simply don't work hard enough to establish their vision. They give you bits and pieces, clues about how to play, but they're coming from a source that they don't clearly share. So in those early Usenet meetups, sparks would fly because the fanbase seems to have come out of left field, while the designers seem to be preaching a position of play that was never really cemented by the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193423/#Comment_193423" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T11:18:51+00:00" title="February 20, 2009 11:18AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>what's the point of ever publishing a game at all, then, other than as a collection of bits?</blockquote>\nI ask myself this same question.<br/><br/>But then, my more recent stuff is more and more a series of collections of bits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193426/#Comment_193426" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T11:44:14+00:00" title="February 20, 2009 11:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Can you see the logical fallacy there?

That is exactly what the next (last?) chapter is about! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>  You're awesome!  (And actually it connects to David's response too.)<br/><br/>Now, after I'd been on Usenet for a while I refined the old position of my old friends.  You remember, they had laid virtually all the changes in the gameplay experience at the feet of the GM. I was not willing to do this, I put it on everyone (though of course the GM was proportionately more important than most of the players due to the increased decision-making power they had.)  But one of the biggest draws for White Wolf fans around that time (and I was and am one) was this really detailed and evocative setting.  I (as you can see) leaned more towards the evocation than the detail, but to the horrified persons who responded to the setting-crashers like myself we could always make a distinction: "Look, there's nothing about Mage that requires it to be set in 1997 America. This idea we're working on of playing it in Cuba in 1940 isn't changing the system, it's changing the setting."<br/><br/>But then of course we had to change some minor parts of the system.  ("Replace the Computer skill with another mental skill..." or whatever.)  And doing so improved the adaptation of the new setting dramatically.  Sometimes we would even do a GIANT change to the system as our centerpiece and then work backwards to the setting that system change got us to.  There was a palpable feeling of difference between setting and system, though, and eventually this feeling came to be demonstrated to be absolute bullshit and completely made up in our heads.  There were two things I experienced at about the same time, one theoretical, one practical:<br/><br/>1 - a game writer, whose name I have forgotten, responded to one of our setting/system hacks with something along the lines of: "Look, I have no idea why you want to put together the game you're putting together here, but the game I wrote for was very specifically a modern-day portion of a larger game..." (and here he said Vampire or Mage or whatever it was.)  "...if you set the game in 1989, or with six factions instead of seven, or with different superpower loadouts, you're really playing just as much a different game from what I wrote as if you played it with GURPS.  I wrote what I wrote for the game that exists on paper. You're doing what you're doing for a game that you hope will exist at a table."  And that distinction was, A) very insightful, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> quite mature, and a precursor to the more progressive position a lot of designers today take, and C) completely at odds with the idea that by changing the setting we weren't really changing "the game".  Combining this with my previous experience that just by legal character creation choices the entire experience of gameplay can be forever altered, it was a huge eye-opener and solidified my theoretical views finally in their complete form.  Everything you do in playing a game is customization, and the act of customization destroys the written setting and system equally. (So to belatedly answer CK's question, there's a distinction, but it is a distinction without a difference - the decision to use dice or go diceless in Vampire changes the game less than the decision to play a game in modern-day Seattle or 1801 Poland. There can be huge degrees of customization in setting but not system, and vice versa.)<br/><br/>2 - White Wolf came out with a really great and underrated science fiction game, Trinity. I liked it a lot but was put out that there was only one skill for Science and a very detailed setting that could be better explored through more specialized researcher/investigator characters.  So for the first time I turned to GURPS for an actual game rather than just for inspiration and being a "collection of bits", which actually I think summarizes what a lot of people did with GURPS books back then. GURPS Illuminati, for example, is just great for anyone doing conspiracy shit in games even if (like me) they didn't actually own GURPS at the time they got it.  Anyway, I started in on this adaptation from the theoretical point of view I'd reached above and intentionally blurred system and setting changes.  The end result was far more natural, far more satisfying in terms of verisimilitude than the ad hoc brainstormy changes to one or the other that I'd engaged in both on Usenet and in gaming prior to that. I built a skill list from the ground up, an advantage and disadvantage list from the ground up, and a setting from the ground up - collecting "bits" from here and there, inserting my own, altering others, importing still others wholesale, and it was by far the best game I'd ever played in in my whole career up to that point and even the players who are still part of the group today comment on how it was a quantum leap above what I'd previously done. (Edit: And before you give too much credit to GURPS for this, know that I bolted the entire Trinity psychic powers system on wholesale and it worked fine.)<br/><br/>(By the by, you can permalink this post if I ever mutter darkly that gaming theory never helped <i>me.</i>)<br/><br/>And so here I am today, happily customizing - following games here, not following them there, understanding them here, getting them completely wrong there, and doing things that designers would not ever recognize to their games, nor would they want to.  Just like everyone else in the world forever, the end.<br/><br/>PS Let me tell you about my character....<br/><br/>But that's a thread for another time.<br/><br/>Questions about the story are welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193442/#Comment_193442" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T13:49:27+00:00" title="February 20, 2009  1:49PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read your full post yet, but I wanted to breathlessly reply, "Yes.

I still love chess, though my opportunities to play it are further and further apart now.  But when I was in college, and had really just started getting interested in competitive chess, I discovered to my dismay that the University of Arizona Chess Club had just fallen apart the previous year after the guy who had organized it before had graduated and nobody had stepped up. Me and another guy who was a much better player got together and decided we would re-launch the chess club.  The University was helpful and so were the local chessplayers. So we got the band back together, I mean the club back together.<br/><br/>This meant that the first competitive chess I ever played in was a tournament I organized myself.  Now, I am not a great chessplayer.  I love the game but I am not great at it.  I enjoy playing it, I really love to watch a great chess match being played, I'm semi-knowledgeable about the game, I even taught it to kids for several years for pocket money, but when it comes to me sitting down opposite you and playing, I pretty much suck.<br/><br/>So all right, the rules of chess. Pawns move one space forward, they capture one space diagonally, and sometimes en passant, and on the first rank they have the opportunity of moving 2 squares forward instead.  Rooks move horizontally and vertically, bishops diagonally,  blah blah. You win by attacking and trapping the opponent's king.<br/><br/>Shouldn't a game like chess, with its constrained inputs, be impervious to my previous thought that all play is inherently customization?  As it turns out, the answer is no, not just "no", but "NO" in letters 400 miles high.  I got to play a lot of chess in a lot of different contexts in a lot of different places.  And I quickly found the rules of chess don't define all of the inputs into the play experience.  If you're quietly playing a club match, that's one experience. If you're trash talking the shit out of your opponent in a street game for five dollars, that's another experience.  If you're in a 3-round competitive match, that's another experience. Heck, just the decision whether to offer or accept a draw completely altered everything, when I moved from "let's play and see who wins" to the competitive scene.<br/><br/>Then I learned enough about strategy to see the customization there too. I didn't like positional play, in which you crept forward bit by bit to try to conquer one square at a time with perfect defenses. I liked dynamic play, where you went diving in and tried to shake things up and create opportunities. Some openings were cool and fun, others were boring and lame. So I played the cool openings. Others in the club felt differently, they liked the lame openings - a matter of taste even here.  So playing against them was a very different experience from playing against someone like myself. And that wasn't even taking into account skill level!<br/><br/>Chess was an amazing experience, I highly recommend it to everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278330/#Comment_278330" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T12:27:18+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 12:27PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2010 12:30PM by Wordman.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some thoughts that struck me while reading this...<br/><br/>Imagine five stereotypical middle school girls (A, B, C, D and E), all "friends". One day everyone but E are together. Early in the conversation, someone makes a catty comment about someone, and this provokes an enthusiastic reaction from the others. Because of this reaction, others are soon adding their own catty comments.

Because of this reaction, others are soon adding their insights on the troubles of the world. Before long, they are having a grand old time, solving Problems That Matter.<br/><br/>Most social interaction (cocktail parties, cooler talk, watching the game, gaming) is like this: without anyone really meaning to, there is a sort of "cred" that is being competed for, <i>but what exactly gains that cred is an emergent property of the interaction</i>.<br/><br/>This "emergent cred" has some interesting properties:<br/><br/><i>Uses positive feedback</i>. That is, gaining cred increases the desire to gain cred for all in the interaction and more deeply defines the sort of actions that result in getting cred. It also leads to an escalating standard, a one-up-man-ship, as time goes on (actions snowball, in other words). In your all-thieves game (probably), as people did cool/funny theify things, it led to people wanting to do more cool theify things, with the baseline for what was "cool/funny" increasing as people had more success with it.<br/><br/><i>Sensitive to initial conditions</i>. Usually, the <i>first</i> action that really "hits" with the group deeply colors the shape of the cred and how to win it. I'd bet that the first really cool thing that you can remember happening in the all-thief game is something that "set the tone" for the rest of what was cool about the game.<br/><br/><i>Unconscious</i>. While most people in a social situation are vying for the "cred", almost none actually realize they are doing this, and would probably deny doing so if questioned about it. This is one of the main reasons the nature of the cred changes so much from situation to situation: because people don't know they are doing it, it cannot be planned in advance.<br/><br/><i>Subversive</i>. Since it is not planned or realized, but happens anyway, vying for cred often undermines what might, at the outset, appear to be the "social contract". This is why the game as written often diverges from the game as played.<br/><br/><i>Inscrutable</i>. If the emergent cred-chasing was "fun", it might not be obvious why, and the experience itself might not translate well to people who were not there, particularly if it diverges from the emergent cred they were chasing when they played. Thus, you'd expect a lot of "those guys are mucking up my game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278394/#Comment_278394" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T16:07:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  4:07PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, you're not "customising" chess rules by your strategic or tactical preferences, that's plain bollocks.

No question. And if we customize the rules, chess variants result.  But my decision to play the game of chess in one style or another style can't possibly be said to be "applying" the rules of chess.  Can it? Like, what in chess am I "applying" when I decide, "fuck the Ruy Lopez, I'm so fucking tired of the Ruy Lopez, I would rather play any opening in the world than the Ruy Lopez".<br/><br/>Take the D&amp;D styles I identified above. If we had a full on, "everything you say must be in character" player, that's not something the rules of D&amp;D have anything to say about. Yet it is a strong preference some people have - and the preference is based on the pronounced effect in play it has.  (And people who hate it also have that preference based on the effect in play.)  So saying that that player is merely "applying" D&amp;D to their play when they decide "I'm only going to speak in first person" or "we're all going to play thieves" seems absolutely the wrong word.<br/><br/>But if you like "application" better, can't I just search/replace for "application" in this thread and have the same outcome, i.e. the overwhelming, catastrophically powerful importance of individual choice to play experience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278417/#Comment_278417" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T17:41:10+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  5:41PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point, seriously, I have no idea what point you were trying to make JD.

The difference one of degree, not one of kind. Of  course there are fewer ways you can customize chess when you play it, because your inputs are constrained. For bikes, it's even moreso, you've got route and speed and...that's it? (<a href="http://www.2dayblog.com/images/2006_december/brad_bicycle.jpg" rel="nofollow">Maybe not...</a>)  RPGs are remarkable because the gigantic range of potential input (one of the most significant features of RPGs) provide for an enormous range of potential play decisions, styles, and even just plain simple <i>moments</i> where something is different.<br/><br/>As for whether it's overwhelmingly obvious, clearly it isn't to a lot of people. Clearly they don't think it's true at all, or if it is true, it is something unfortunate and bad, something that is someone's <i>fault</i>, possibly a game designer that didn't design things right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278420/#Comment_278420" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T18:10:42+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  6:10PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Like, what in chess am I "applying" when I decide, "fuck the Ruy Lopez, I'm so fucking tired of the Ruy Lopez, I would rather play any opening in the world than the Ruy Lopez".</blockquote>\nYou are applying your choice.<br/>In chess, this is called a turn.<br/><br/>This line of argument makes no sense to me, or anyone else, I think.<br/><br/>So, an analogy:<br/><br/>1.)

What if it is a theme the designer would really really really really really hate, as we discovered when we started talking about it on Usenet?<br/>5 - Is trash talking while playing chess customizing the game?<br/>6 - Is setting a game that is based on the modern day in 1978 customizing the game, even if no rules are changed?<br/>7 - Is changing the die rolls for a game customizing a game, even if the resulting fiction is not changed in any way?<br/>8 - Can you have different play experiences with two different groups (or the same group on two different occasions) using the same textual rules? If so, what would you call the difference between the decisions made by the two groups?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278424/#Comment_278424" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T18:42:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  6:42PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I use and understand the word "customize"?

The rules give each player clear choices to make on their turn that can build into a unique game. chess is a popular game and it's play has grown greatly over the ages. Even with this growth players still use the same rules to start and end a game of chess. to me this is the best kind of input players can have on a game. chess will continue to grow and be shaped by the people playing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever traditional roleplaying is vastly different<br/>\nThere is only mere advice for how to start playing an RPG, and even less guidelines on how it should end. with this lack of structure it calls upon the player's to figure out how to make an actual game of it. it must by nature of it's incompleteness be completed by the people playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like or dislike the lack of structure is your own business, but i feel the two games are vastly different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf chess lacked structure as traditional rpgs do you would start every game by figuring out how large of a board you should play on, how many and of what type of pieces each player should use, how to take turns, and what the victory condition was.<br/>\n<br/>\ni would call what players do in chess "player input" your wecome to call it customization but i think your not going to get your point across for most people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278428/#Comment_278428" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T20:19:45+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:19PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Re <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a>, the one that's not about customizing: I'd call that a "difference in taste" and/or possibly a "different use of the same tool." It's the same difference as the fact that I can ride 50 miles down Arizona farm roads on the very same road bike that Lance Armstrong can and will ride 200 miles through France on.</blockquote>\nWhat you're saying is that the act of riding a bike includes a lot of decisions about where to go and what to do, decisions you yourself make - must make - will always make - when riding that bike, and those decisions are of crucial importance, sometimes much more importance than particular bike design decisions, to your experience. <br><br>And what I'm saying is that the act of playing a game includes a lot of decisions about where to go and what to do, decisions you yourself make - must make - will always make - when playing that game, and those decisions are of crucial importance, much more importance than particular game design decisions.<br><br>I mean, does it really matter that much that GURPS is 3d6 instead of 1d20? Well, trick question. To some people it's of enormous importance. To others, it's trivial. Some people would have exactly the same play experience with both sets of rules. To no degree, to them, would that customize their experience. Probability distribution are such a minimal part of their experience, or they don't get probability, or they don't care about it, or the GM setting a target number makes probability distribution irrelevant to them, or whatever. That game design decision is only relevant to some subset of the players. The same is true for every design decision. <br><br>Similarly, decisions in play are highly relevant to the experience - even moreso than any particular design decision in many cases. Of course that's not true for every play decision. You said that playing D&amp;D with all thieves didn't really change D&amp;D for you. For you, that gameplay experience isn't affected by that decision. It's not relevant.  But remember RPGA guy? Remember all those people I met on Usenet? Every play decision, like every design decision, is relevant only to a subset of players. Where it's relevant, it may or may not be a good idea for that subset of players. <br><br>This to me says the player and the designer are doing, on some level, the same thing. There's nothing privileged about design's contribution to play experience. Call it "player input" or "application"if you want. I like "customization" because I feel it gets to the core of what's happening. The designer is gone, far away, and would hate what the player is doing with the game forever even if they did know about it, or maybe they would love it, nobody knows or could possibly care.  The player is modifying the play experience with every decision.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278429/#Comment_278429" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T20:34:37+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:34PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting conversation to me.<br><br>I mean, there are games, games have rules, focus, example text and usually a theme to follow ("Vampire games should be dark and moody games of personal drama and social games - Sez Designer"). <br><br>Then, there's this phenomenon. It's called "You're playing the game wrong." Or "You're not playing it as the designer intended".<br><br/>I don't see it leveled around here as much, but it is leveled.<br/><br/>* Sometimes we all (including designer) view it as awesome: Using Game X for Setting Y.<br/><br/>* Sometimes some people view it as awesome, while others view it as an abomination: See "How JD runs Primetime Adventures, with a GM role who /acts/ like a real Hollywood Producer, and not just simply a GM with another name". He's been called out for "Playing it wrong" by some horrified fans, while others think its edgy and awesome.<br/><br/>* Sometimes only the person making the changes view it as awesome: Adding bullet tumbling/lightsabers/"realistic initiative" system to Dogs in the Vineyard, or whatever.<br/><br/>There's a movement... well, nothing as organized as a movement, but it's kind of a thought I've seen shared around in the small press design community which says: "Let's try to write the rules in a way where people can reliably recreate this fun experience". But then people inevitably change or ignore those rules... Or they play in a way that isn't backed up by the text. Is it the same game? Again, some people, and sometimes even the designers, issue the "You're playing it wrong"/"You're not playing as intended" Yellow/Red cards. Ex: See the Adept Press forum, circa <i><b>all the time</b></i> (it's rarely ever Ron blowing that whistle, tho; usually fans).<br/><br/>JD's coming from a view of "This is why you can and should expect people to Play Your Game Wrong, where "Your Game" is the game you designed as a designer, or a game you love as a player.<br/>From that point of view, he's kinda kicking the wheels as to how far you can expect someone to go before it no longer is the game that you designed (as designer) or played (as a fan in another group, who had a much different experience of the game). He's also kicking the wheels of how much of the "playing in a way not backed up by the text" is a responsibility of the designer, and how much they can expect/rely on people to play it differently anyway.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure about the recent customization posts (haven't read through them all enough to settle in), but the concept is an interesting one, particularly something that designers should read, know and try to come to grips with when the first play reports come in from their game where the group didn't have fun; or the group played differently (by setting or rules or theme) than intended (and then did or did not have fun from there) when the designer's pen hit the paper in writing the game; or when two groups emerge with totally different experiences (good and bad; dark themed and light themed; funny and serious; etc).<br/><br/>In the end, I don't think there's a right answer: This is like Nature vs Nurture, and trying to play devil's advocate for a 100% leaning on either side (Is it Nature or Nurture? Is the group responsible for a fun time or the designer?)  is folly, but it's interesting to consider both angles when thinking about writing a complete game. Or as a designer when someone doesn't like your game after having tried it. Or in discussions of games where people's experiences with Your Favorite Game differ wildly from yours.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278430/#Comment_278430" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T20:47:06+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:47PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2010 2:21PM by Andy.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to add one thing: It might be that JD's experiences, or... whattayacallit... fervor on this issue comes from a place that is a non-issue for most of us, which is why a lot of us are reading his writings on customization (I should add the earlier stuff, before the kinda cloudy Chess examples) going "Well, duh, of course! I think this too! Does anyone NOT think this?" It might be one of those things that drives people to hold extreme views/say weird things, but I think that the fundamental experience that led him to thinking about these things (and making it a pocket issue) were those conversations on the internet (Usenet, in this case) where people played Game X, Designer X who designed the game (in part; the rules; the theme; both; or a combination), and Designer X being horrified at what they read: Someone playing their game in a manner they clearly didn't like or imagine. (see: IRC chat-based D&amp;D Sex Sessions on anonymous forums, etc)<br/><br/>And I think that place where this started from is kinda alien to a lot of us, basically having fallen into the world of small(er) press games (playstyle aside) as we have here. It's like we're kind of the audience, but also at the same time kinda not the core audience for this sermon.<br/><br/>See, while there are Yellow Flag/Red Flag referees judging you (in private or in public) about how you're playing the game wrong/not as intended, there's a fundamental difference in the mindset of the Game Designer/Freelancer from the big companies of the 90s, and the mindset of a Game Designer of a shoestring budget small or independent game.<br/><br/>Classic Game Designer: <b>"Holy shit, look at this forum thread! This person is totally playing my game <i>wrong!</i>"</b><br/>vs<br/>Small Press Game Designer:<b> "Holy shit, look at this forum thread! This person is totally playing my game!"</b><br/><br/>It's likely because of that dichotomy there that we (folks reading/posting here) don't see these calls as much as we would if were were posting at the forums of a specific game company (large/small/otherwise). Hence, kinda alien. Until we design a game then find out someone didn't like it, and strive to understand why; or why someone played a game you love and thought it sucked.

Popular games like LCR have no choices, games of chance, war, candyland, you could even argue some skill games do not have choice. sure you have the choice of how you interact with the people outside of the game but this is the same for activities that are not playing games, like dancing, or listing to music the people your with will change the experience<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying games is order of magnitudes different then designing games. it's very easy to take a turn in a game of chess, it's far less so to create something that so many people will resonate with and be entertained by for eons.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall some games work for some people and some games dont, even in highly structured board games there are disagreements about table talk and how much social engineering should mingle with tactics and strategy. These are simply qualities of play that some are more likely to enjoy them others. some people love to talk while watching a movie others want to murder people when they speak during a film.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut these things are a trifle compared to what incomplete games like RPGs can produce. Especially when you compound the confusion of rules and principles on the part of most authors. When your relying on the audience to finish the game, your going to end up with a wide variance in what people experience when they play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278437/#Comment_278437" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T21:41:25+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  9:41PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>your assuming the game in question has choices or decisions to make, plenty of games don't.</blockquote>\nOh, true.

I'm glad that some "design is everything" person can advise me on how to <i>design</i> a fun game, and someone like JD can advise me on how to <i>play</i> a fun game, and I don't need to care which of them is "right" about "play vs design."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278574/#Comment_278574" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T13:22:18+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  1:22PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, JD, I'm trying to make sense of your point, but there's a lot of text here to try to dig that out of.

Some might have skinnier tires, some might be heavier, some might have those weird curvy bars and still others might have long banana seats. But a bike's a bike, and all I want it to do is to get from here to there. This is where the "a good GM can make any game do anything, the system totally doesn't matter" crowd sits, right?<br/><br/>* Folks who understand there are different kinds of biking: skinny tires + light frames + aero bars are for going fast on streets, while knobby tires + heavier frames + slack geometry + moto-style bars are for riding on dirt. They may own one or the other or both, but they'd never make the mistake of taking a road bike on a trail, or a trail bike on the road. I feel like this is where mainstream gamers find themselves. They get that there's a difference, they probably haven't investigated the differences that much, and make do with their choice.<br/><br/>* Folks who have a fetishistic understanding of the nuances between a racing hardtail, an all-mountain bike, a downhill bike, a freeride bike, a rigid singlespeed, 26 vs 29 inch wheelsets, etc. -- and probably own one or more of *all* of these bikes (along with a touring bike, a true roadbike, maybe even a tri bike). This is the category I strongly suspect many in the SG scene find themselves in when it comes to games: not only is there a right tool for the job, but willfully using the wrong tool (or using a perfectly good tool the wrong way) threatens the entire experience.<br/><br/>Obviously we're talking personal safety here, and not the more ... ethereal realms of aesthetic appropriateness or gameplay or whatever. But really, isn't that what much of this conversation comes down to? Ignorance versus snobbery?<br/><br/>Then you've got a whole 'nother kind of community, the ones who weld their own frames, build their own wheels, hand-assemble parts from other bikes, and create extremely specific and personalized rides that nobody else can probably even keep upright, much less squeeze great performance out of. Unless they're professional custom bike builders, and you're getting something made *just for you* by a master craftsman. <br/><br/>I wish there were more game designers like that. I have no idea how they'd make a buck doing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278603/#Comment_278603" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T15:51:05+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  3:51PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like motorbikes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278605/#Comment_278605" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T15:54:13+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  3:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2010 3:59PM by Jesse.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>The problem I have with your extension is that no one in that crowd or among those tiers has any confusion over what a bike is *for* fundamentally.  They might disagree on details but if you showed them a picture of someone eating a bike, they'd all be horrified or think it's weird.<br/><br/>At least when *I* talk about "designer intent" I'm talking about that kind of deep philosophical divide.<br/><br/>There are things you can do with some games that are the equivalent of eating bicycles.  Maybe even fun and interesting things.  But they are clearly not what it was build *for* in the first place.<br/><br/>Oh and to carry the analogy even further I don't like to guess at things purpose.  Nor do I enjoy trying to get things to serve purposes they weren't build for.  So if I've never seen a bicycle before I appreciate it when someone tells me what it is, how to use it an what it was built for.  So I can get maximum usage out of it immediately and not have to go through a painful experimental trial and error process.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

A lot of people think bikes are toys. Many are under the impression that they're to be ridden to the caf\xe9 to be shown off.

It could be that part of the miscommunication here (because I really doubt he's saying anything actually controversial) is that, when he says he makes his games be the thing he wants, it's just kind of obvious, up to the point where unique and highly refined parts are being swapped out.</p>\n<p>Like swapping out Campagnolo Centaur brifters for Shimano barcons in friction mode, because you've always liked them.*</p>\n<p>* Someone just let me know if the metaphor gets too thick.

He takes the character in an entirely different direction.<br/><br/>Are any or all of these customization?</blockquote>\nWell, all three are choices, right? So the designer didn't know which one they'd take, right? So the designer doesn't know what kind of play experience will result from a player choosing one or another, right, or at least, didn't tell us? Like, there's nothing that says "pick this way, it's the best!"?  <br/><br/>And we can agree that in all three cases, the player in question (or the other players) might have strong, or not so strong, aesthetic preferences about which one is the best one for the play experience? i.e. the player in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> thinks, "Ugh, no, why would I resolve such a delicious dilemma, I'm keeping it forever and ever!" and as a result chooses as he does.  Or perhaps the player to #1's left thinks, "Why is this idiot stringing us out on which way he's going to jump on this issue, does he not see this is completely ruining the story and his character?"  And nothing in the text (it's been a while since I read/played Lady Blackbird, great game) says which way someone should choose, so we reach the following conclusions:<br/><br/>A - The designer has no particular intent that the players take any of these actions in any of these Situations. The designer's intent is thus useless to the players in making this decision, it's already gone, we're past that, trampled right over it to get to these.<br/>B - Nevertheless the decision may be very significant to the experience of play, so significant in fact that it might make or break a game for someone who has narrow preferences and strong feelings on this subject.<br/>C - The decision gets made - in all three situations, the player takes action when the decision point comes up.<br/>D - The result gets into play through the normal operation of the rest of the game.<br/><br/>I don't have a better word for this than customization. Nobody has yet offered me one that isn't  too mechanical - remember, this decision point, while mechanically supported in the game, is not itself mechanized - the straightforward "application" of the rules won't make this decision for the player.<br/><br/>But let me throw a couple of more Situations in that will help undermine my position much more than all the bikes in all the Queen songs ever written:<br/><br/>Situation #4: It's someone's first time playing a game like Lady Blackbird and they just don't exactly get Keys. They buy off one, but are really not sure what that means.<br/><br/>Situation #5: It's someone's second time playing Lady Blackbird and they kinda get Keys, but are really not sure how they fit into the fiction. They buy one off because they get that they're supposed to, and it has to do with their characters' decisions, but don't have a clear picture of how that feeds back into the game or the fiction.<br/><br/>Situation #6: The player gets Keys, but really doesn't have a significant preference as to which way the character goes - either way will produce a fiction equally facile for them. They pick one at random and buy that one off.<br/><br/>In these, there's a much stronger case to be made that no real customization is taking place. The player lacks the knowledge, skill, or desire to make this a conscious decision to maximize their own enjoyment.  4 and 5 are more akin to the Candyland player - along for the ride. 6 is an even bigger problem for my position. Someone without strong opinions as to which way something will go may have all the skills necessary to customize the outcome, but no real desire to do anything more than come along for the ride. What's worse is when 6 is sitting next to someone with narrower preferences. That can be a big problem for a group. By the way, it's a problem that's inherently beyond the reach of the designer. Replace the "Keys" aspect with any aspect of the game with player choice involved. See?<br/><br/>Here is the takeaway from all this, and it really says very little about design except in passing:<br/><br/>As players develop knowledge about the game and skill in the game, they will take action to make the game experience personally enjoyable to them. This  is the best definition of player skill I can think of.<br/><br/>Design stops well before play begins. Whatever the designer's intent, it's often opaque and is, except in Candyland situations, incomplete with respect to play.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised to see all the worshipers at the church of design pissing on their altars and setting fire to their banners at the smallest provocation. I mean, saying "I went to all these different places and people were playing games in ludicrously different ways" and then adding  "but they weren't, you know, CUSTOMIZING the game, let's not be silly JDC", that means the designers must have designed them to be played in many different ways, and they succeeded in their goal and are to be lauded and patted on the back instead of sneered at. We should be celebrating that amazing accomplishment!  Imagine making a bike that with no customization could accomodate both a 300 pound obese man named Francis and ...wait, no, I still don't understand that metaphor.<br/><br/>I mean, "incomplete" design? Lady Blackbird is incomplete because it doesn't tell you which Key to buy off. "Oh, JDC, you're so fucking stupid, you're the dumbest man on the Internet, don't you see that's the player's choice? Don't you see that the designer clearly intended for that to be a choice for the individual player, based on their aesthetic preferences for the fiction, at least once they understand what's going on mechanically?" Then, when GURPS told us to pick a premise for our campaign instead of delivering one, clearly intending for it to be a choice based on our aesthetic preferences for the fiction, once we understand what's going on mechanically... "THAT was an incomplete game, now you're getting it." <br/><br/>Thanks for all of the whispers, by the by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278699/#Comment_278699" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T02:55:10+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  2:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2010 2:59AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe we could say fine-tuning instead of customizing?  The players have these keys and other stuff provided at the start of the game, and by their decisions during play (guided by their preferences), they steer their Lady Blackbird experience in a direction that will hopefully satisfy them.  They're playing Lady Blackbird, obviously, they're not making any major changes to the system, they may not even be making any minor changes...but they've got input into <i>what the game is actually like at that table</i> and can use that input to <i>make that specific game session more like what they enjoy.</i>  The designer doesn't get a say in that process, but can try to design the game to encourage particular decisions and entice particular players more than others.  And even then, the players will get the final say when it comes to fine-tuning their experience with the game, and could just as easily give the designer the metaphorical finger and go a different direction.<br/><br/><br/>Mostly though, I think we're just looking at the same old division:  those who want to look at games from a design perspective (as in, the game is the thing the designer wrote), and those who want to look at them from a play perspective (as in, the game is what the players at the table actually do).  They don't care about the same things, they don't want to talk about the same things, but god love 'em, they'll fight to the death over which one of them is more wrong than the other.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I mean, it's just a label. What matters is the contents of the box under the label. The contents of the box you seem to be describing is "play." That is, we could replace the word "customize" with the word "play" in almost anything you've written and it would still make sense.<br/><br/>So, to answer you're thread title, you think all play is play because you're right. All play is play.<br/><br/>As for people calling you the dumbest man in the whatever, I'll assume that actually happens to you every day. It seems weird. But I have no idea why you'd claim it if it wasn't. <br/><br/>As for people claiming GURPS is incomplete because it doesn't hand the players a premise... again, I'm left believing that you've heard people say this. Like two. Maybe three people. I'll just have to believe you. Because, really, I know you're tilting your lance against <i>something</i>... but whatever these things are I've never encountered them in the solid, clearly passionate battle lines you seem to live by when you post these things.<br/><br/>I want to add that I think Jesse's belief that somehow some text is going to guarantee that everyone is on the same page is Quixotic. I mean, it took me three visits back east to realize that when my sister said, "Let's go for a walk," she mean she'd be wearing running shoes and walking at a ridiculously brisk pace and I was wearing an overcoat expecting a casual stroll. But is that what you're railing against? Really? Jesse wanting text to help make things clearer at the gaming table? Is that it?<br/><br/>Cause if that's what all of your declared persecutions of people calling you stupid and such come down to... I'm not sure if some xanax might not be in order.<br/><br/>Because, honestly Jason, the opposite case of whatever it is you're describing is a kind of horror movie where people read the rules of a game carefully, out loud, moving their pieces along the board without any input of their own. Which is, to my knowledge, not like anything in reality. I get the feeling you think someone or some people out there are arguing for exactly this sort of horror movie play... but I've never met them or heard anything about them. Do you actually think anyone is arguing for this?<br/><br/>So. I don't think you're dumb. I just think what you're saying is obvious. Which means I think you're right <i>and</i> you're leaving me scratching my head. I know you think it's some kind of needed aggressive action on your part to say things you think are bold to counter mean, angry people who want no one to have any choice at the gaming table. But I've never seen or heard from these people. I wasn't there at use.net, I've never lifted heavy theory, so maybe I've just missed it all. And if there are people out there making the astounding claim that people should just follow "the rules" and not make decisions, well then, more power to you and go fight the good fight.<br/><br/>But I've never met those people. <br/><br/>So. I was there at the earlier part of the thread saying, "I can't wait for the part where I'm amazed." Taking away your claims that you're saying something extraordinary, I read what you've written and go, "Ummm. Okay. So. That's true. Anyway, let's play a game."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278728/#Comment_278728" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T07:44:36+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  7:44AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2010 9:36AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've <i>always</i> felt it was obvious, so triumphantly declaring it's obvious doesn't bother me at all.

I don't know what misconceptions others have, but this completely obvious and very cool thing seems to be controversial whenever I mention it, so much so that it is considered the "dumbest thing on the Internet" - John Harper and akin to eating bicycles? (I think.) You should ask others instead what their misconception about my statement is, I sure as hell don't get it.<br/><br/>Why not ask why someone thinks play isn't customization, especially in RPGs, if everyone else is saying "oh god, this is so obvious, it's so obvious JDC is right forever, why is he even saying it?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278758/#Comment_278758" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T09:48:54+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  9:48AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2010 9:53AM by Joli.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EDIT: Crossposted with everything from post 99 onwards.</b><br/><br/>JD, I'd like to say something, just relating my own feelings and experiences, free of labeling and name-calling:<br/><br/>I've noticed that when you talk about your own experience and positive know-how gleaned from it, I'm all ears. I love reading about your Arrested Development-style Star Wars campaign, or how to construct a campaign from ginormous setting books, or how to run a kick-ass Changeling campaign (just finished reading The Further Adventures of Halley's Comet on your rec--so, so good!) Similarly, when this thread kicked off I was all, yeah, cool! We're hearing about JD's formative gameplaying experiences and they're really interesting! I was on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>It's when you start speaking negatively that I start to wail and gnash my teeth. It's not the blitheringly obvious claim that every player of every game forever has a different experience because of their unique inputs, that makes me see red--it's when the phrases like "make every designer cry, forever" and "play is an act of destruction" come out that I start sputtering at the screen, and a spectral image of that infamous motivational poster floats before my vision. And to top it off, in my experience these missives seem to usually pop up as an interjection into someone's thread to the effect that the entire discussion is misguided/meaningless/totally wrong forever.<br/><br/>So examining all that for a moment, it comes to me that two things boil <i>my</i> blood: 1) you seem to be putting distance between player and designer, to the point where "the designer" is a hostile and alien concept. Which may have been true of the overall RPG scene at one time, and may be true of parts of it today, but this parTICular corner of the current scene is one that is blessed to have "player" and "designer," "consumer" and "producer" all mingling around into one big melting pot. That's an incredible, wonderful strength of this community, that players of games have this access to designers' heads through blogs, conversation, and meeting up for actual play. And the distinction is blurred to the point where "designer" can be anyone who cares to grab a wrench and pop a hood open. I like that. But it means that  "the designer" around here, means "us, the community." I mean, when you say "the Designer of Poison'd" I'm like "He's not 'the Designer,' he's Vincent. I met him and played with him, tons of people are on a first-name basis with him!" I don't want to lose that closeness by distancing the designer's input from play.<br/><br/>And 2) it looks like a slap in the face to people who are interested in discussing this or that thing, to have you jumping in all the time to post some paragraph about how the distinction is meaningless. I believe the term is "threadcrapping." I'm sorry that YOU've incurred some threadcrapping here, but please, can't we stop the cycle somewhere?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278762/#Comment_278762" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T10:04:25+00:00" title="June 30, 2010 10:04AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>I think the complication comes into play here:<br/><br/>Your examples of customization range all over the map, from choosing a premise if the game doesn't provide one, to limiting the classes available to a game of D&amp;D and sticking to the lower levels, to choosing a new strategy in a game of chess.<br/><br/>I would offer that some of the se things are expected of any game and that your definition is so tautological as to be useless, while in other cases it might be a big deal to make a change to a game. And, further still, in some cases it might really screw up a game. <br/><br/>In other words, there's always customization. But some customization is either:<br/><br/>a) workable and expected: the chess example you gave; choosing a premise for a game if none is offered.<br/><br/>b) maybe workable but maybe not expected: the <i>D&amp;D</i> school for wizards game example you gave; deciding as a group that <i>Sorcerer</i> is all about playing horrible people who do one thing after another to drive their Humanity to zero. It's "maybe" workable, because if someone showed up wanting to play a fighter and level up as hard as he could, there'd be a clash of expectations of play. If everyone is on board, it works, if not, someone feels like he's being cheated of the chance to play D&amp;D. In the <i>Sorcerer</i> example, as long as everyone is enjoying that, it's fine.... but doing that kind breaks so much of what the game is about and closes down many avenues of play that make it worth playing. "Customized" yes. Effective customization, maybe not.<br/><br/><br/>So, you've made a bunch of statements that can't be refuted, since yes, all play demands players having input into how to play.<br/><br/>But you've glided over any problems that might arise from customization that doesn't work. All of your examples are full of unicorns and sunshine. But All the players are in agreement (and it's the lack of this agreement that Jesse is focused on -- and in your play experience apparently this isn't never a concern.) <br/><br/>The issue is clouded because when "customization" works, it works great. And when it doesn't, it doesn't.

They say, "This is for walking" and do nothing else.  That's not very useful to me as a consumer.  I can go "walking" any old way way I want whenever I want.  I can drive around town and visit a dozen shops and collect all the material I need to do any kind of walking myself.  Why am I buying a book that does nothing but give me permission to go walking?<br/><br/>Purposeful design does all that work FOR you so you can get at the activity faster.  But even that isn't quite enough.  Because I can imagine a box labeled "For Walking" and in it are a pile of running shoes, a pile of comfortable flats, a guide book, some hand weights, some sweat pants, an umbrella, a pair of binoculars, a device for tracking speed and millage.  Well, that's not particularly useful to me either.  I have NO idea how to use all of those things in concert.<br/><br/>At this point there are two options.  You provide a guide book that tells you how to sort all that stuff for different effects.  If you want EXERCISE then use the running shoes and the sweats.  The weights and the device are optional but can be useful.  Everything else is not useful for the purposes of exercise and will likely get in the way.<br/><br/>My *preference* though is to have unique kits built for unique purposes.  I want TWO boxes.  One clearly labeled "Walking for Exercise" and "Walking for Sight Seeing."  Each one containing ONLY the tools and instructions necessary for achieving the desired result.  That way I can safely ignore one or the other if either exercise or sight seeing doesn't interest me.  Or I purchase both and use as appropriate.<br/><br/>That obviously doesn't mean I have no decisions to make.  If I'm using the Walking For Sight Seeing box then I have to make choices about the guide book.  I have to decide when and where to use the binoculars.  I have to decide if the rain is heavy enough to use the umbrella.  But the one thing I'm NOT doing is sitting there wondering what these weights have to do with Sight Seeing.  Because the "buy in" for the activity and the tools provided for that buy in are 100% aligned.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278837/#Comment_278837" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T13:57:11+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  1:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Joel - Fair enough, I have no interest in "the community", so if I'm smashing your windows with rocks, I can dig how that could be upsetting to people.</blockquote>\nAm I putting words in your mouth if I were to change this to say something like:<br/><br/>"Fair enough, I have<i> interest in people/games, and </i>no interest in "the community<i> (of designers/design followers/banner-waving/etc)</i>" "<br/><br/>...because I think The Internet garbled the intent of that sentence, but I'm not sure.

I mean, it's great that people design games and all, but I really am more interested in the games than in the process of design, or designers, or anything like that?  <br/><br/>If someone comes along to Tucson and we game together, that's great, but let's be practical. Occasional play is not the basis for a community. Liking the same games is not the basis for a community.  Hanging around each other and doing things of common interest is a community.

I'm cool with either of those words. I think I even used "personal" several times in the thread.  But I doubt either would be less controversial than "customization", especially "personal".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278870/#Comment_278870" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T17:54:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  5:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whereas I consider community a baseline value for all my interactions with anyone. The non-physicality of the internet is an obstacle to that, but not a negator of it. When internet interactions become totally unlike community (E.g. 4Chan, Youtube Comments), I shun them. I think Story-games is more community-like than most places on the internet, and I strive to enhance and bolster that. I don't think it's going to replace my local circle of friends, or my family, or my church, or whatever. But I still make interaction here as much like (the best in) those interactions as possible.<br/><br/>Bottom line, when I call this a community, I just mean that we're "here," talking to each other, and we're both human beings, so, nonphysicality be damned, how about let's treat each other with respect and hospitality, and celebrate the value in each other, instead of relating as passing strangers shouting in the market square? (and by "each other" I mean, all of us.) So when I hang out "here" for several years, and have repeat interactions with you, Andy, Joshua (either one), Eero, Ben (any of several), Jesse, Christopher, etc. etc. I'm going to treat you or them as having some kind of accumulated relationship. A community.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>"I'm not a game deisgner, have no interest in game design, the game design community, marketing, or anything else than being the occasional consumer".<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, basically. I mean, it's great that people design games and all, but I really am more interested in the games than in the process of design, or designers, or anything like that?<br/>Here, let's take this a step further: I am a game designer. I've designed games. I'm a game publisher, in the broadest sense: I've written some things and made them available to the public through whatever means.<br/><br/>I'm also a player, and a guy posting on this forum, and a whatever else I am at any moment of any day. And I don't think I'm anything special. Yeah, I get a charge when someone appreciates the design work I've done, but I also get a charge when someone appreciates some discussion work I've done, or some play I've done.<br/><br/>As I said before, I want to close up the gap between "designer" and "player," between "producer" and "consumer." Because in this particular [scene, community, movement, milieu, whateveryawannacallit] that gap is kind of nonexistent. Not everyone designs games, but a lot of them do, enough so that design isn't this thing on a pedestal but just part of this whole exciting mass of hobby activities that we all love. That's really cool to me. And therefore dismissal of "designers" as relevant or even participants in one's gaming process at all, really gets me down, that's all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Anyway, when did the thread become about me and my posting habits, this is not the thing to do to a narcissist, people.

I hope it was at least a little fruitful for someone besides me.<br/><br/>That, and I thought maybe your posts deserved a more metered counterpoint than "dumbest thing on the internet."<br/><br/>I've said my piece.

Drift is changing shared Creative Agendas, or going from not sharing one to sharing one. Now, though I dispute that GN-and-S are helpful Creative Agenda classifications, this whole thread is based on the idea that CAs (aesthetic priorities/matters of imaginative interest) exist.  When a player plays, they pursue things they like, <i>their</i> matters of interest, (as opposed to, in agreement with, mistaken about, or completely ignorant of the matters-of-interest to a designer who isn't playing.)<br/><br/>Now, according to the definition, drift is typically expressed by changing rules. I don't agree with this part of the definition. As I noted above, we drifted D&amp;D when we shifted our matter-of-imaginative-interest in the (accidental) creation of our all-thief game.  We didn't change a rule, but we certainly made a major change to our aesthetic priorities and as a result made an enormous difference in our play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279030/#Comment_279030" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T23:36:52+00:00" title="July  1, 2010 11:36PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think that's what I mean.
