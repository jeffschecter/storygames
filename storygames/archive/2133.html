                    Since the revised version is out, I figured it would be a good time to dust these notes off. This is more like a random oracle now, but I'd like to make it better. This hopefully give suggestions for prepping a pickup game of DD.<br/><br/>(1) What season is it? Draw a card.<br/>* A-Q = 1-12 = which month. (Draw again on a K.)<br/><br/>(2) Who's causing some trouble? Draw a card.<br/>* Clubs: A solider, rebel or renegade.<br/>* Hearts: A lover or a preacher.<br/>* Diamonds: A thief or a businessman.<br/>* Spades: A lawman, bounty hunter or rogue.<br/><br/>(3) What's one consequence (direct or indirect)? Draw a card.<br/>* Clubs: Someone is humiliated.<br/>* Hearts: Love is lost.<br/>* Diamonds: Property is stolen.<br/>* Spades: Someone is killed.<br/><br/>(4) This uncovers someone's Devil. Draw a card.<br/>* Clubs: Pride or Sloth<br/>* Hearts: Envy or Lust<br/>* Diamonds: Greed or Gluttony<br/>* Spades: Wrath<br/><br/>(5) Repeat these steps as desired to add more detail until the players feel there's enough to go on. Use (2) to describe existing people in town, use (4) to add additional Devils of different NPCs, etc.                </div>
