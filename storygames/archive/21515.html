I suppose that it was assumed that the GM and other players would control the game. What it meant in practice was that an individual who didn't feel comfortable complaining was forced into situations they didn't enjoy. I played, and indeed still play, a lot of female characters and it wasn't uncommon to have the GM or other players acting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highly</span> inappropriately towards the character.<br/><br/>Some sort of sanction to allow the rest of the group to realise that you aren't happy or that you need a quiet OOC word is a great thing, so long as the rest of the group accept and understand why it is there. Sadly, a dysfunctional individual or group is likely to remain dysfunctional even when sanctions are in place. That comes down to choosing your group and players - you game because you want to and not because you have to.<br/><br/>In LARP (which I dabbled in many moons ago), we used 'Timeout' to break the action. This could be called by umpires to halt action for scenario reasons, but could also be used by a player who needed a halt - injuries, costume damage or exhaustion were the most common reasons.<br/><br/>As with most things, it is about your group. Some people might use sanctioning other players as a power-trip, claiming they aren't comfortable with a situation simply to shoot-down another player's spotlight moment. Others might be afraid to be seen as interfering with someone else's fun, despite squirming uncomfortably inside.<br/><br/>The best will use sanctions if required, but these are probably the ones who don't need it. If someone looks uncomfortable as you describe a scene then the empathic thing is to ask if they are okay. IC/OOC be damned, we are still people and I would far rather destroy someone's game immersion than see a fellow player distressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470675/#Comment_470675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T16:35:04+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  4:35PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2018 12:26PM by APM.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still very confused by the comments I got in my Anno Daemonum thread. I created some structures for the x-card in my game. Each character has their own card (so it's easily accessible). Each card has an x-side and an o-side.<br/><br/>You can use it in 3 ways:<br/>1) you put it in the middle of the table - that means "cut" as used in larps. You stop what's happening and you erase the scene that was. This is the most important function.<br/>2) you show the x-side and say "try a different way" (or "please don't" or whatever). This is a soft move to show that you don't like the way things are headed. It could be arachnophobia when someone says "spiders come pouring out of the walls", or it could be that someone comes up with a silly idea at a tense moment and that would really ruin it for you. So this is not cutting the scene - you haven't crossed that border yet...  It's simply a way to very clearly show disapproval, giving the group a possibility to change the events. If this isn't honored to your satisfaction you can always use function <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/>3) you show the o-side and say "stay with it" or "keep going" or something similar. This means you want to see the current action continue a bit further in the direction it's headed. It could be someone chickening out of a love scene or a tense moment where there are still narrative gold to be mined. It's not supposed to encourage peer pressure, it's just a way to show approval and encouragement, so that the players in the scene knows what the others think as well.<br/><br/>So, I've tried this a few times and I have come to use both function <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> &amp; <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (edit: I actually mean function 2 &amp; 3 - I somehow got them mixed up as I wrote this). I don't see a problem with this concept.<br/><br/>However, the critique this method has been given is that one shouldn't mix psychological well-being with approval/disapproval. To me those are in the same ballpark, and I am yet to be convinced of why they shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Anyone has thoughts on this? Maybe someone who can guide me to an article where this issue is addressed? (the article mentioned in the OP was good by the way)<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I hope it's okay to use this thread for this question!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470677/#Comment_470677" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T17:52:51+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  5:52PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2018 5:54PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a lot of convention games with an X card on the table.<br/><br/>It was only ever used a few times in all that time.  An average of less than once per two games, I'd say.  (Full disclosure: I don't play a ton of "push the comfort zone" games.)<br/><br/>However, when the event facilitator (often the GM) introduced it, that introduction tangibly changed the expectations around the table.  For some it was a reminder, for others, an eye-opener.<br/><br/>The relevant expectation that was communicated was, "We care about safety here.  And, should it be an issue, we have a way to address it."<br/><br/>In my opinion, that can make a big difference.<br/><br/>As for encoding safety in design...  "If you play this with strangers, consider introducing the X-card," usually seems sufficient to me, unless it's a game that's specifically about pushing comfort boundaries.  So it depends on the game, and it depends on how much you want to assist facilitators at conventions, meet-ups, etc.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/APM">@APM</a>, I don't know what's best for your game on that score.  If you do decide that you want to prioritize safety, though, I think you risk diluting that all-important facilitator into on the topic by blending it with other concerns.<br/><br/>I'm going to take a "safety matters" spiel a lot less seriously if it overlaps with a "here's how we edit out dinosaurs with laserguns" intro.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I've played Archipelago and similar games with "try another way" or similar procedural options for rewriting parts of the fiction that felt implausible or off-tone or something.  I've used those options fairly frequently, and I've seen others do so as well.  Invoking them seems to come from an entirely different headspace than safety-based X-carding, as far as I can tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470680/#Comment_470680" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T18:08:39+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  6:08PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Completely tangential to the thrust of the discussion, in the UK and Europe we are familiar with 'red card' and 'yellow card' for sporting and gaming infringements, mainly coming from football (soccer) but also seen in rugby. I don't know if the USA and elsewhere have a similar system in their popular sports. <br/><br/>It occurs to me that a red and yellow card could work very well in the manner described by APM - a yellow card for the 'warning, we're getting into uncomfortable territory', and a red card for 'stop right now and retcon'. I have no idea what sort of symbol could be used for 'carry on, this is great', possibly a graphic of applause or even a different coloured card. A green card for 'carry on' would also fit our UK traffic light system.<br/><br/>Obviously an understanding of the symbols and how they are used are important in what they are trying to achieve, so the best way to approach it is to use whichever method will be more intuitive to your audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470681/#Comment_470681" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T18:11:48+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  6:11PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2018 6:12PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a great thread for further discussion, so thank you for bringing up some questions.<br/><br/>The issue with mixing "let's tune up our game to our expectations" and a safety tool like the X-card is that they are fundamentally very different things.<br/><br/>"Do it a different a way" and the "O-card" are ways of steering the game in a desired direction. It's a communication tool, and it's expected to start a conversation. You're enjoying the game, and you just want to encourage people to drive faster. It's fundamentally negotiable.<br/><br/>The most important use of the X-card, though, is to signal that the game is breaking down on some way. It means you want to get off the ride, period.<br/><br/>To me, its value lies in the expectation that it is non-negotiable: a hard break.<br/><br/>Those are different things, and, I think, both can suffer if the line between them is blurred.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470683/#Comment_470683" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T19:11:24+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  7:11PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The O card is pointing to the map and saying "Let's go there" or "Let's not go there."<br/><br/>The X card is jumping on the brakes before you go over the cliff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470686/#Comment_470686" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T20:47:45+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  8:47PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1 card, 3 functions, of 2 different natures.<br/>I call it frugal and I love that. <br/><br/>Using the same item is assuming that when someone finds something in play repulsive, there is little chance that some other one will be enjoying their head off.

The X Card is for things which might be traumatizing or deeply unsettling. It shouldn\u2019t be used when a player simply dislikes the way a game is headed, or else it loses its protective power for those who truly need it.<br/><br/>Consider the fate of the trigger warning \u2013 a genuine tool to protect people with psychological trauma from being blindsided by traumatic memories, now easily dismissed &amp; derided because too many people invoked it simply to avoid content they disliked.<br/><br/>As a designer, then, you want to create rules that actually <i>discourage</i> the use of the X Card, so that it maintains its power as a tool of last resort.

I'm mostly playing with unknowns at conventions \u2013 I always had the X-card present but no one has ever used it. Could be because I'm careful with how I set up the game; to make everyone comfortable. Could be because I mostly play fun and creative games ... but phobias could still trigger.<br/><br/>I never used "try another way", or seen it been used, because the environment we set up during a session is about building on each others ideas. "Describe more" have, on the other side, been used before.<br/><br/>The only downside with using the X-card would be that someone is blocking other people. This should be avoided by a agreement at the beginning of the session, or doing exercises and explanations that forms the participants state of mind. I do that at all the sessions I in charge of (as explainer of the rules or as a game master).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470695/#Comment_470695" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-16T08:43:07+00:00" title="March 16, 2018  8:43AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2018 8:48AM by DeReel.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone abuses the X card, it will be obvious. By my rules, exclusion ensues. The session grinds to a halt, and, spite and all, that's clearly for the best.<br/><br/>I am more preoccupied with the experience in which someone at the table feels uneasy : "Others might be afraid to be seen as interfering with someone else's fun, despite squirming uncomfortably inside". In this case a scaling code for signaling "aesthetic dissonance", like the 3 lights system, is more useful. I am no psychologist, but I believe this person will go to orange light easily, and refrain from using red light. <br/><br/>That's when the cumulating scale is useful : if the signal is repeated by another player (typically a supporting friend who understands what's going on), the signal goes up one level. It's still trading security for fluency, but it cuts the "unexplainable irrational one-person-only" knot.

Someone else in the game doing something that doesn't make any sense or that is wildly off-tone is clearly not on the level of, say, lurid depictions of sexual violence. There's no question of that. However...<br/><br/>-If a game's tone drifts in a silly direction, that can mean not taking something seriously which should be serious<br/><br/>-If a game's fictional causes and effects become too divorced (my Night Witches example), that effectively robs players of agency, and loss of agency is often associated, for many people, with the kind of thing the X-Card is designed to prevent<br/><br/>I have no problem with the idea of using a color-code system or some other safety mechanism besides the X-Card. I played in an excellent LARP once with a green / yellow / red system and it was great.

Again, I readily acknowledge that I don\u2019t have the most knowledge or experience here. But isn\u2019t the value of an X-Card as a safety tool that it\u2019s a total, irrevocable stop to what\u2019s going on in the fiction? I just don\u2019t think irrevocable stops should be used for aesthetic decisions like tone drift or fiction logic breaks.<br/><br/>It seems to me that those are things that need to be discussed amongst players \u2013 both before the game (in the same way that we all agree to use the same rules at the outset) and during the game when issues arise. If roleplaying games are games of collaborative storytelling, the aesthetic needs to be arrived at through consensus and buy-in.<br/><br/>I guess my other issue is, where\u2019s the line, then? If you\u2019re allowed to X-Card something for being too silly for the game\u2019s fiction, why can\u2019t you X-Card another player for saying something you disagree with, or for describing their character in a way you dislike? It does seem to me that devolving the tool to those kinds of disagreements robs it of its power as a safety mechanism.<br/><br/>I have to say, the stoplight seems much more useful as a model if we\u2019re going to bring aesthetic considerations into a \u201cplease stop this\u201d system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470705/#Comment_470705" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-16T23:12:50+00:00" title="March 16, 2018 11:12PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps just call it something other than X-card?

But if you do, why call it the X-card?<br/><br/>I would expect that if you just called a stop-light card (which seems to me like an useful expressive tool, particularly the positive feedback part) the "reaction card" or whatever, instead of calling it the X-card, then nobody would mind. Anybody could use the reaction card the way it's described, and if they felt that they need the relatively harsher and more absolute X-card on the side, it's easy to have both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470710/#Comment_470710" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-17T11:21:28+00:00" title="March 17, 2018 11:21AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2018 6:03PM by APM.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts on this!

The only way to test these things 'in the wild' is to use them with a group, of course.<br/><br/>Emotionally brutal LARPing, or indeed tabletop gaming, seems to be a valid approach so long as the game is all about that from the start and people know what they are heading for. Some people are eager to have that emotional immersion and others not so much, I prefer my in-game emotional breakdowns to stay with the character but I know that the line is much narrower in LARPing.<br/><br/>Trusting people not to be dicks in games is something I don't think anyone has yet solved. Yes, you can kick them out pretty quickly but it seems a little harsh for a single infringement and a tough subjective decision if the level of dickery is borderline. I think we all have seen that 'one player' who makes us grimace but is not actually yelling bigotry or bullying people. Do you kick someone out for having a different gaming style?<br/><br/>I think that we need to accept that any warning card system will initially be open to abuse by 'that player'. If the system is 'no questions asked' then it makes it harder to identify actual dickery. Maybe the player has psychological trauma that the rest of the group don't suspect and is using the veto for genuine reasons that nobody else understands. <br/><br/>I would hope that a quiet word after the game could resolve things, but that does rather encroach on the 'no questions asked' aspect of card systems. I guess the point is that no hard and fast rule will work.

Of course it's not the first option to kick someone out - but if they repeatedly abuse the trust that has been given them, nobody will want to play with them.

Something similar is also true of the X-card in particular, which is explicitly a tool to erase events that someone has already described doing/happening - it reaches backwards, and asks us to pretend that what's bothering us just didn't happen at all.<br/><br/>This only really applies to "fade to black"/"Veils" when they're used as safety practices rather than just as a way to deemphasize something that's uninteresting, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471199/#Comment_471199" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T19:33:28+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  7:33PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've always used 'fade to black' when the course of the ensuing action is obvious to all concerned but nobody really wants to have it explicitly spelt out.

In my experience and in my games, 'fade to black' is not generally a safety mechanism, it is a 'we don't need that spelled out' mechanism. Not because the ensuing description would make someone uncomfortable but because it doesn't need to be described and such a description is simply not required.<br/><br/>Now obviously the groups we play in dictate what experiences we have had with 'fade to black' and some may well use it as a safety card, but this has not been my experience. I consider myself a robust and broad-minded individual and would not be grossed out by descriptions of extreme violence or unorthodox sex. If I knew that the two (or more?) characters in question were sharing bodily fluids, however, I see no constructive reason why the procedure needs to be described in any detail. Perhaps it does need such treatment to add to the story, but this would definitely be uncommon.<br/><br/>Safety is a different matter in my mind and is not covered by 'fade to black'. Fade to black is a narrative device used to 'draw a veil' over actions or scenes that can be assumed without devoting time describing them. It helps narrative pacing and avoids getting bogged down in unnecessary detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manixur" title="manixur"><img alt="manixur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manixur">manixur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471208/#Comment_471208" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T21:17:12+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  9:17PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I remember correctly, wasn't the original context of the "Veils" term sexual content that players were uncomfortable with?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471209/#Comment_471209" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T21:33:56+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  9:33PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2018 4:32AM by APM.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do you see any reason why "fade to black" <i>couldn't</i> be used to avoid uncomfortable material, though?<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote>\nOne reason could be that a veil requires everyone at the table to understand what is about to happen (for it to work like a veil and not just a cut scene). This means that the nasty things you might feel uncomfortable about have to be established none the less.<br/><br/>If I'm uncomfortable about child abuse would it help me that we fade to black when the drunk parent picks up a belt? I'm not sure. I mean there's a great risk that I still would feel uncomfortable about the fallout from the event.

If I, as a straight male player, am playing a female character (and I often do), I do not particularly want a bearded overweight male GM begin graphically describing how an NPC is seducing her and what they get up in bed together. It is not that I am uncomfortable with the concept, just that I don't really want to hear it there and then.<br/><br/>Then there is the second issue, that of being uncomfortable with the concept being on the table. I would raise objections if a player wanted to play a child molester, for example (no matter how great the rest of the character concept), would object if the GM sprang a scenario closely paralleling real-life tragedies, or similar gaming situations where I just do not want it to be part of the game at all.<br/><br/>The first situation I would be happy to 'fade to black/draw a veil'. Yes, I know it is still happening but I don't have to listen to the description. The second situation I would use whatever the group had available as a red card/X-card. I don't even want it going on 'behind the narrative veil' and would urge the parties involved to find a different approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471217/#Comment_471217" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-28T01:57:31+00:00" title="March 28, 2018  1:57AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, the phrase is "Lines and Veils" for a reason.

This allowed them to participate more fully in the story because we didn't just fade and move on, but we took a break, broke from the table, started chat on another subject, etc. That said, we also discussed some things that we would flag as "this session may contain" to allow decision making over participation.

I think that the more comfortable you are in an established group, the less such mechanisms are required. That said, we have certainly vetoed certain situations before they happened (one GM firmly stating 'there will be no rape in my game' when an evil character had a young female NPC at his mercy), so in one way we have used the same ideas but differently presented.<br/><br/>However, I intend to implement a system of cards based on traffic lights: red, yellow/amber and green. Nowadays, I am more aware of the need to allow players to actively censor RPG scenes that they find objectionable without the need to actually break into the game and explain why they don't like it (not an easy thing for someone with low self-confidence). This all ties in with my love of storytelling within the game, of allowing the narrative to flow as much as possible. Obviously this only applies to my own view, others use the mechanism differently (or not at all). <br/><br/>The green card denotes that a player is enjoying the scene and wishes for the action to continue, no matter what his/her roleplaying of the character might suggest. I would see this as subtly encouraging another player to elaborate on their description and to give them encouragement that they are being entertaining, without the need to break into the flow of the game to explicitly state this.<br/><br/>The amber or yellow card is a warning, 'be wary of where you are headed with this.' It allows a GM or player to steer the action before hitting the rocks of unacceptability. I imagine that it will be obvious in most cases what they warning refers to, but it might need further elaboration at the time. Essentially it means, 'as a player, I don't like where this is heading, I hope you aren't going where I think you are.'<br/><br/>The red card, or X-card, is a straight-up, 'stop, I don't like this'. Every person has different 'red lines' beyond which they find unacceptable. This might be because they are unusually sensitive to given topic (possibly due to personal experience) or just that they have a lower threshold for tolerance in a given area. I have played with someone who took their religion seriously, for example, and we were careful not to casually mock or belittle organised religion while he was playing. That might have been a red card moment if the group had needed a reminder during the game.<br/><br/>The 'fade to black', by contrast, I use as a narrative device in the same way as old films used to depict scenes of romance. The violins would increase in volume, the hero would passionately kiss the heroine, and the camera would either pan away or fade to black. We knew what was going on by implication and didn't need the gory details. Of course, in that case it was as much to avoid offending the audience and censors as to maintain the romance, but times have moved on yet the 'fade to black' remains a useful 'moving on' mechanism.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471231/#Comment_471231" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-28T14:00:08+00:00" title="March 28, 2018  2:00PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> - Thanks! That is different to how it came across. Sounds like a really easy to integrate mechanic.

As posters here know, I\u2019ve been kinda anti the X card <small>[not because I didn\u2019t want safety but because the X card wasn\u2019t enough for me, pre-therapy. I can handle more unsafe play now]</small>, but seeing it expressed in those terms, and in such a mainstream game, made me want to reevaluate it.</p>\nSecond, I disagree with this:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>1 card, 3 functions, of 2 different natures. I call it frugal and I love that.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> teaches that every function needs its own interface. Things should be as simple as possible <em>but not simpler</em>. Having two different functions on the X side (lifting it vs putting it on the table) is hard to remember and confusing. Having two different symbols with nonobvious meaning (the X side vs the O side) is hard to remember and confusing. Having a non-complete option matrix (1A holding up X side, 2A putting X side on table, 1B holding up O side, 2B ????) is also confusing.</p>\n<p>Third I\u2019m glad I read Jasons article because it was good. Hopefully these techniques will make it so that people don\u2019t actually have to ask each other the eponymous question.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471593/#Comment_471593" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-10T08:31:14+00:00" title="April 10, 2018  8:31AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you !
