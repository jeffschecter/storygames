In the game I submitted, a zombie type game called Unity where the zombies are more of a collective trying to absorb the players than undead, I used a rotating game master to describe scenes. I also tried to add a mystery to the game, which ended up turning out less than stellar, mostly because I don't think I really had any rules about that sort of thing. (I know, I should have had more guidelines if I wanted something to be a theme, but it was for a contest and I was rushed). <br/><br/>But it got me thinking, is it even possible to have a mystery in a game without a GM? Are there any games now that do this? Do you think that players could even be trusted to keep secrets without the guiding hand of a GM? My instincts say that this should definitely be possible, but I can't really think of anything that could be done about it. So, what do you think? Is a GM necessary to keep secrets, or is there another way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184191/#Comment_184191" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T18:12:59+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  6:12PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not only can it be done, but it has been, in <i>Dirty Secrets</i>.

If you want them to actually be piecing the mystery together from "hard evidence" like a puzzle then no I don't think it's been done  Dirty Secrets as mentioned does the rotating GM with a single PC mystery very well.  But it does it by shifting the focus onto character motives rather than "evidence."  A game of Dirty Secrets can get kind of messed up if players start narrating in too many immutable "clues."<br><br>The central thing that makes Dirty Secrets work is that you're not allowed to narrate anything the Investigator can't see.  So what the multiple GMs do is have all the NPCs take action, character revealing/defining action without specifying their motives or indeed having any clue about their motives themselves.  It's a very interesting head space to get into because you do stuff like narrate, "The banker sighs longingly, hesitates, and then says, if you want to know about my wife business dealings I suggest you talk to her brother."  Why the long soulful sigh?  What's her brother got to do with her business deals?  Who knows?  Not even the person narrating knows.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game people fill in this grid with the names of people they think might be guilty.  When the grid gets near full and the token that moves around it gets "trapped" you roll and if the token lands on a name that person is guilty.  And here's the thing: All the Investigator has to do to "solve" the crime is *justify* all the NPC's behaviors relative to the crime and the criminal.  This turns out to be a frighteningly easy thing to do as long as you didn't get bogged down in stuff like fingerprints and half scrawled notes and cigar ash.<br/><br/>See Spione for a similar effect with regard to the spy genre.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184201/#Comment_184201" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T19:20:40+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  7:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>For those on the story games forum, but not in the challenge, my argument is that it is difficult to create a build-up towards a big reveal when the gamemaster keeps changing.

Interestingly we got a big huge reveal in one of our games of <i>Dirty Secrets</i> when we figured out that the helpful character had been feeding false information to the investigator and was in on the crimes in a big way (at which point she got a card and became one of the key characters). I say figured out because when she was first passing along information we all, including the narrator at the time, thought she was on the up and up. It's only as the game progressed that we realized she must have been lying in those early scenes.<br/><br/>Also, everything Jesse says really nails DS. Although, in the example listed above, there was a lot of physical evidence. When it was clear that the physical evidence was inaccurate, it pointed to the person who performed the autopsy as one of the suspects. I also feel that the veto rules go a long way to preventing truly destructive narrations from occurring.<br/><br/>Man, this is all reminding me of just how awesome DS is. I really must play again soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184205/#Comment_184205" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T20:26:04+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  8:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2008 8:27PM by madunkieg.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you're describing proves my point. From what you've said, nothing in Dirty Secrets is ever "revealed." Before something is declared false (be it a motivation or physical evidence), it is not just perceived as true, it <i>is</i> true. Declaring it a false actually changes it from true to false, and that feels like choosing the ending because you're just rewriting the story until it all fits. In the same way, the guilty party isn't guilty until the end transforms that party into the culprit. The game may still be very fun to play, but it's not a mystery because there was never anything hidden, just a lot that was as-of-yet undeclared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184257/#Comment_184257" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T09:51:15+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  9:51AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>First, disclosure.

Thanks to this thread, I got to look at Dirty Secrets, and I think I like it! Although I have to admit it's also because I think you were able to do something that I thought I was doing in a game of my own, Promise Hollows, for the Genre Redesign Madness contest that Graham just ran. (A mystery in the setting of a suburban town.) Maybe I should re-read that "Is there anything new to design?" thread... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I do think that my game is different in several ways, and I think it turns into something like Clue, in that there is a specific mystery/secret to uncover (and you get it by revealing various aspects of the private lives of each character and then attempting to connect those aspects together). This one secret becomes the goal for certain characters to uncover, but the twist is that pretty much everyone has a secret, and there can be multiple criminals in the room, or even none at all. That way, the process of unraveling the mystery is more about HOW characters push their individual agendas, and less about WHAT the characters may have done. (I will be tweaking the rules this winter holiday, so I'll try to post a link to the second draft in Jan. if anyone remains interested.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that leads me to guess the answer to your original questions is that Mystery + Multiple GMs can be done.

How do players describe a story that builds up to an ending none of them know? Of course, Dirty Secrets solves the problem of foreshadowing, but it does so at the cost of discovery.<br/><br/>This is a tough problem. It not only affects mystery games, but also conspiracy, politics, espionage and, to some degree, exploration and horror games. It's also part of why I think the traditional gamemaster plus players setup is such a successful approach, because it can do these sorts of stories well.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, I realized that I have played one solution, though. Some politically-oriented larps, like White Wolf's Vampire, have player characters committing acts of villainy as befits their roles. Other characters may then seek out the villainous individual through various means.

Because the game selects the perpetrators of the crimes, there is actually a real sense of discovery. Because, there's a pile of facts and then there's this randomly selected character who did one of the Crimes. Now, you must find the connections between these facts that justifies this person doing one of the Crimes.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's not the same as a predetermined outcome.

At the start of the scenario, the PCs have access to a list of keywords relating to the mystery: the players use keywords to open corresponding envelopes. For example, a PC who goes to question an NPC can open that NPC's envelope.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn each envelope are a series of small cards or slips of paper, each of which corresponds to an action the PC can take at the location or in relation to the character on the front of the envelope. To continue with the above example, the NPC might be questioned about her alibi, her inheritance, her witness statement, etc. The cards then have further keywords on them, embedded within text relating to the mystery, e.g. 'She says you should talk to her brother, John Smith', with John Smith being the new keyword.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, this would be a very labour intensive way of creating a mystery game and it would preclude the author of the game from taking part in playing it. Also, each set of envelopes and cards could only be used once: it would be necessary to re-write a large proportion of them in order to produce a new mystery. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe little thought exercise above makes it clear to me that there are two approaches to creating a mystery scenario where the mystery is not emergent from player interaction. Either you can write out the whole thing like a normal scenario, but the author still doesn't get to play the game, or you can draw elements at random from a limited set (e.g. Clue/Cluedo) which tends to make all the mysteries a bit samey.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the middle road then? The author creates a set of Clue-style cards using the keyword method, but only a random subset of these cards are used in each session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184485/#Comment_184485" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T07:06:31+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  7:06AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>An ugly "fix" for this would be to keep rotating GMs by scene, but have each GM run a separate mystery, like an ensemble-cast TV cop show. <br/></blockquote>\nThat actually sounds like a fun game.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184495/#Comment_184495" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T08:17:36+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  8:17AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (2) That does sound like a workable fix.

It certainly felt like, at one point, we discovered something we didn't previously know. This is what I've said in the past regarding a game we played of DS:<br/><br/>"There's one scene in particular I would like to talk about. The opening scene with Lucy (who was at this point a non-character) and the investigator. In it, Lucy describes the murder victim and how she was murdered, going into a fair amount of detail, including a blatant rip-off of, or, if one is generous, an homage to, Chinatown, all of which sets up a lot of the action to come.<br/><br/>It was a great opening scene in terms of serving the purpose of opening scenes (laying lots of clues to be followed up on in the middle part of the story).<br/><br/>Later, Lucy is now a character, and it turns out that the murder victim is actually a suicide victim and that Lucy helped cover it up. But, in the opening scene Lucy said it was a murder victim, and spoke about the murder in a very CSI manner, giving out lots of details.<br/><br/>Meaning, in the opening scene, Lucy was lying through her teeth. But the really amazing part is, in that opening scene, the two advisors, the investigator, the investigator's player, and the narrator, all thought she was telling the truth.<br/><br/>Now the opening scene is incredible because it not only set up action, but it also had a character who was deeply involved in everything, up to and including the investigator's back story, lying big time and nobody knew it."<br/><br/>When we found out that the only way to fit the fiction with the die rolls was to have Lucy be lying, I would have to call that a sense of discovery that we experienced. The mechanics revealed to us something about the fiction that we hadn't realized. Or at least that's how it felt to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184513/#Comment_184513" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T10:50:29+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 10:50AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Then, at a certain point, someone (not you) have to choose a perpetrator of a crime.</blockquote>\nNo, no one chooses it - it is chosen randomly.

Some of them could be addressed -- providing tools for people who don't know how to write/run a mystery story so that their mysteries won't look lame and awful next to the awesome mystery the rotating-GM to their left is doing.  Others may only be a problem for some people -- some may find it aesthetically displeasing that the mysteries will not all proceed at the same pace and end at the same time (although personally I think that'd be a feature rather than a bug).  There may be problems of scale -- if you've got 6 people at the table, having 6 separate mysteries going (splitting everyone's attention 6 ways) sounds like a total catastrophe, and so you might want to limit the number of rotating GMs.<br/><br/>And like I said, at its core it's not a groundbreaking idea.  Basically instead of having a traditional RPG mystery (one GM invents a mystery, and the players solve it), you're just running a handful of trad-RPG mysteries at the same time.  Nothing wrong with that (obviously it's a method that works, as decades of successful mystery gaming will attest to), but if whiteknife is looking for something more excitingly hippie-flavored for his game, it won't appeal to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184567/#Comment_184567" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T23:19:46+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 11:19PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>some may find it aesthetically displeasing that the mysteries will not all proceed at the same pace and end at the same time (although personally I think that'd be a feature rather than a bug).</blockquote>\nThis is why you have a big whiteboard like they had on Homicide, with closed cases in black and open cases in red, and you bring it out before every session and update it at the end of every session.<br/><br/>"Cases go green before they go black!!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184568/#Comment_184568" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T00:12:37+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 12:12AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2008 12:13AM by Moreno R..">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Then, at a certain point, someone (not you) have to choose a perpetrator of a crime.</blockquote>\nNo, no one chooses it - it is chosen randomly.

That was a huge part of my other thread.  If someone has pre-established authority to decide what happened in the mystery AND they in fact exerted that authority, then yes, that's discovery - but if they had no authority, or they chose not to exercise it, that makes that whole area of enjoyment disappear.  There are other areas, obviously! Dirty Secrets hits all sorts of them (improvisation being the most important - I don't think I've ever had anyone come to the end of a game of Dirty Secrets and say 'that was a really satisfying crime resolution we had there', not because of any lack in the game but just because improvisation is not the strong point of the groups I've played with) but it absolutely doesn't hit the "I am figuring something out!" enjoyment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184618/#Comment_184618" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T11:51:56+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 11:51AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            May I suggest that what is being discussed here isn't discovery vs. surprise but rather accomplishment.

I feel like noodling for a minute; feel free to ignore me.<br/><br/>Personally, I think discovering facts or piecing together strings of facts into a postmortem narrative sits well within the realm of gamist play: here's a challenge, I dare you to beat it. In that regard I'm not sure why it really needs to be any different than any other step-on-up type of play. I guess it's different when there's a central challenge around which all the players are gathered. I'm trying to think of existing challenge-based games where there's a core challenge that the players work together to beat, and that is not "owned" or operated by a single player (to fit with the OP's thread).<br/><br/>Modeling "mysteries" as a genre, though, is totally different. Mysteries never go unsolved in books or movies. It's never about whether the mystery will be discovered; the core of the story comes from what it'll cost the characters to chase the mystery to its conclusion. I guess that's the Gumshoe model, roughly, right?<br/><br/>So I guess the perfect mystery RPG will tap into the same cool stuff of both approaches: the players enjoy the sense of satisfaction from assembling the mystery's solution in their minds (i.e. "solving the mystery" even as the onscreen characters struggle to solve it, because the audience usually has information the characters do not), while creating a story whereby the characters accrue ever-greater costs to themselves in pursuit of the clues the audience already has.<br/><br/>Now I'm thinking that, to be really true to the genre and achieve both discovery and character transformation, the problem is the player/audience divide. Which, in an RPG, there isn't. Usually.<br/><br/>Some of that might be cultural: We already have a tough go of investing in other players' screen time. So while theoretically we could be enjoying an audience-like thrill of watching a player maneuver his character through a scene and experiencing transformation while closing in on a fact the audience already knows, the problem is that the player of that character is still part of the audience.<br/><br/>But what if he isn't?<br/><br/>What if we come up with a way where the "facts" of the mystery -- clues, motive, even red herrings (insofar as they help highlight true motive), opportunity -- which are held in escrow somehow (Clue-style, maybe web-generated since we're in the 21st century), are exposed to all the players <i>except the players of characters in the current scene?</i> So now there's a clear audience -- everyone not in the scene -- as well as active, immersed participants.<br/><br/>That reminds me: The problem with Clue is that it's just assembling the whodunnit, and never addresses motive. I guess the assumption is that everyone in the mansion has a motive to murder everyone else in the mansion. But that's Clue, not mystery fiction. I'd like to see motives and opportunity introduced into the puzzle-solving side of such a game as well. <br/><br/>Another problem: In the genre, either the source of the mystery comes from within the cast of characters, or it's an external threat. In a perfect gaming solution, either one should be available. Logistically, that might be tricky -- but it might be good, too! I'm thinking of Shadows over Camelot: in that board game, there's a "traitor" card but there's no requirement that one of the players is actually the traitor. The odds of the traitor showing up increase with the number of players, but there's always the possibility that there's no traitor. But you still get the paranoia and second-guessing. So that would probably be good to introduce somehow. Uncovering the "I DID IT!" card/fact would also be true discovery.<br/><br/>Another another problem: Make the mystery-solving game too much fun, and you're going to quickly lose the powerful character transformation you see in, say, <i>Chinatown</i> or <i>L.A. Confidential.</i> So I'm thinking character transformation must be tied into clue-revelation, with non-scene-participants acting as audience: They know what clue the player's character is looking for, but what they don't know yet is how they player will transform his character to get to it. Meanwhile, the current investigator knows he's going to have to transform his character to get to the clue, but doesn't know what the clue is going to be. Everyone's enjoying discovery, but on different channels at different times.<br/><br/>I think there's probably something here that'd work.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184857/#Comment_184857" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T15:08:10+00:00" title="December 24, 2008  3:08PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, okay, we can do this. Here's some mechanics. Figure out how to mesh them in with what Paul just said, someone. That includes me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>First get e.g. 24 envelopes and 96 index cards. Label 32 cards with capital letters, 4 each of A-H, another 32 with numerals 1-8, and the last 32 with Greek characters alpha-theta. Now on the back of the As write, on distinct cards, (A,2,gamma), (A,4,epsilon), (A,6,beta), and (A,8,zeta). I don't know how I chose those triplets yet (todo). Similarly on the back of all the cards write triplets, and make sure that on e.g. the 2s you have one triplet be (A,2,gamma). Now put the As in one envelope, the Bs in another, etc.<br/><br/>Pregame: come up with 3 categories. For Clue they'd be Person, Weapon, Location. For each category come up with 8 things and associate each with an index (so Mrs. White is A, Rev. Green is B, etc. and the pipe is 1, the rope is 2, etc. and the Hall is alpha, etc.). Write these down in a very prominent location.<br/><br/>Shuffle the categories of envelopes. Pick one from each category and set them aside. This is whodunit, or whatever. Now remove the cards from the other envelopes and make a big deck of them, and shuffle it. Find someone who can do this without looking at the cards much (while they're still sorted it's easy to tell what's missing). During the game, via some mechanic someone will name a triplet such as Rev. Green with the rope in the Hall. Find the corresponding symbols (B,2,alpha) and go through the deck, taking cards which have any symbols matching the guessed symbols (so you'd take (A,2,theta) for instance), one at a time, with at least one person (maybe everyone? who knows) looking at the face of the card to see if it's a true match. Once you find a true match, stop drawing. Now you have a hand of cards which disproves many possibilities, including the guessed possibility, and its size gives an indication of whether one of the other two guessed things in the triplet are actually part of the solution (if you draw through most of the deck but find a counterexample, you've probably hit on something!). Use these cards for narration, points, bonuses, who knows, and shuffle the other drawn cards back into the draw deck.<br/><br/>More later once I've thought more. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184871/#Comment_184871" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T19:19:47+00:00" title="December 24, 2008  7:19PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>What if we come up with a way where the "facts" of the mystery -- clues, motive, even red herrings (insofar as they help highlight true motive), opportunity -- which are held in escrow somehow (Clue-style, maybe web-generated since we're in the 21st century), are exposed to all the players<i>except the players of characters in the current scene?</i></blockquote>\nI think you've got an interesting idea there - and certainly dramatic irony is a great tool for a lot of situations - but I'm not sure I'm quite wrapping my head around it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184882/#Comment_184882" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T23:13:17+00:00" title="December 24, 2008 11:13PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

This is all still extremely rough and, in fact, totally broken right now. It's also not an RPG, not yet -- I know that. But here's how I'm seeing the shape of play:<br/><br/>There's a mystery. The mystery is comprised of many facts. Each fact is comprised of details, which link back into a little gambling mechanic I'll explain in a minute. But the details are things like "hidden" or "violent" or "the cops"  or "witnesses" or whatever. There's probably a set menu of details.<br/><br/>Each player creates, say, four facts. They each have a budget with which to add up to 4 details to each fact. Not every card need be balanced, so long as everyone uses their entire budget. So some facts are going to be detail-heavy and therefore dangerous to the investigator.<br/><br/>You'll also each make one Motive and one Opportunity. To complete the mystery, you MUST have motive and opportunity...but the only way to reach a scene where motive or opportunity can be uncovered is by accumulating Facts. I'm thinking through ways to restrict the revelation of Facts such that this leads naturally to one of the M or O scenes.<br/><br/>Put your initial on the details side of your Fact. If it's a M or O, write M or O on the back.<br/><br/>There needs to be a bit where NPCs and settings (locations) are created. I'm still noodling on that part. There might be a set library of settings that you can skin to look like whatever, but always feature certain set mechanical features. This is a setting for Facts with violent details; this is a setting for Facts with hidden details, etc.<br/><br/>Aaaanyway. I'm messing with two tracks right now. The one that interests me the most is that everyone shares in playing one Investigator. The whole table plays Sam Spade, for example, and control of Sam gets passed around the table. I'm also looking for a way where each player plays an interested party, and it's up to the table to figure out who needs to investigate the mystery and who needs to hide it. But for now, we all play Sam. And you have to have at least three players.<br/><br/>Prior to play, everyone takes the Facts they created and places them in settings where they fit. Not every setting will have a Fact. Some settings will have more Facts. Shuffle the Facts up, ensuring that any M or O card is at the bottom of the stack.<br/><br/>Characters have Insight, Assets, and Liabilities. Insight is probably a set number like 4. Assets are things like "fighting fit" or "contact with the cops" or "a gun" or whatever. I'm thinking Assets are just an abstraction, and actually you'll have tracks for things like health that go both positive and negative, with 0 being baseline and each step above being an ever-greater level of Asset. <br/><br/>Insight is your base # of dice you'll roll. It's also how many details you can have told to you about a Fact prior to trying to resolve it. The player to your right will be running the scene where you're uncovering a Fact, and that player can reveal details in any order he sees fit. Because each detail ties into an Asset or a Liability.<br/><br/>The current Sam player arrives in a setting. The player to his right draws the topmost Fact and frames the scene. The rest of the players view the soon-to-be-revealed Fact. (I'm thinking it might be super-cool to allow the peanut gallery, ie non-scene-framers, to help the Sam player in some way; still thinking on that). The Sam player decides to gamble away his Insight to have details revealed, one at a time. The scene framer reveals the details on the card in any order he wishes.<br/><br/>If you have a matching Asset (detail: violent! asset: gun!), you take one of your insight dice and set it to 6.<br/><br/>If you have a matching Liability (detail: hidden! liability: blind!), you take one of your insight dice and set it to 1.<br/><br/>Roll the rest of your Insight dice and add the preset dice. <br/><br/>If you roll 15 or higher, the Fact is revealed, and the next player takes over Sam -- and decides which of several settings he's going to.<br/><br/>If you roll a 14 or less, the Fact is revealed and the Investigator is Transformed. You either reduce an Asset by 1 level, or gain a new Liability.<br/><br/>At this point, the scene framer (guy to your right) can declare the fact is a Red Herring <i>if you drew your own Fact</i>. The Fact cannot be used toward achieving Motive and Opportunity, but the next player is still restricted to what setting he can go to next. As long as you're on a path that is reachable only via a Red Herring, you cannot reach M or O. But eventually you'll uncover a Fact that continues the network of Facts without getting the Red Herring involved.<br/><br/>At the end of each scene, as the Fact is revealed, add one counter to a central pool. This central pool shows us how close the villain is to "getting away with it." I'm not sure how big this pool will be, but I like that chasing a Red Herring gives the villain even more time to get away. Maybe 2x the # of players, so everyone gets two scenes. Maybe there's a way to remove tokens from the pool -- like, if you bring more Assets to a scene than you actually need. Or take out a token in lieu of presetting an Insight die to 6. <br/><br/>So basically play continues round-robin style, with each Fact building up toward revealing Motive and Opportunity. If the players reach M and O before the villain gets away with it, the gig is up and the hero saves the day. If the players don't, well..."Forget about it, Jake -- it's Chinatown."<br/><br/>Lots of holes to fill and I'd much rather build more roleplaying into this. I don't think the "we all play Sam" is going to be an issue, in fact it might be a real benefit since everyone should theoretically be equally invested in Sam's success and his Transformations. Also, typical noir-style mysteries aren't known for especially nuanced character development. Maybe everyone playing it safe with Sam's personality is a good thing.<br/><br/>I need more time to work out more details.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184910/#Comment_184910" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-25T13:46:22+00:00" title="December 25, 2008  1:46PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more thought I want to post up, specifically to address JD's thing.<br/><br/>The Peanut Gallery<br/>On any given player's turn, the player to his right is the scene-framer. All the other players -- not the Investigator and not the scene framer -- are the Peanut Gallery. They can see the details of a Fact. As the scene framer describes the scene, he's introducing the Fact's details into the scene in the course of the description but isn't calling them out as such. If the scene framer describes all the details, he can call for a roll to resolve the scene and find out if the Investigator gets the Fact with or without a Transformation.<br/><br/>Now, prior to this roll, the Investigator can state he's using his Assets. If they counter a specific detail of the Fact, he pulls a die out of his Insight pool and sets it to 6. If it's not relevant, the die is lost. <br/><br/>At any point in the scene's description, the Peanut Gallery can address the Investigator's player like an audience member talking to the screen: <i>Don't go in there! Watch out, he's got a gun!</i> They're highlighting what the details of the Fact are, and giving the Investigator a heads-up as to which of his Assets to commit to the upcoming roll. Comments from the Peanut Gallery are not without cost, though: Every comment the Peanut Gallery makes adds a token to the Escape Pool, thereby speeding the villain's eventual escape from justice.<br/><br/>The formal procedure for all this needs to get ironed out some but that's the basic idea. In a 3-player game, you have one player playing Sam, one player framing Sam's scene, and one player playing the Peanut Gallery, helping Sam out but also speeding up the Escape Pool timer.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184923/#Comment_184923" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-25T16:44:35+00:00" title="December 25, 2008  4:44PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 25, 2008 4:45PM by madunkieg.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just been reading one of the late entries for Genre Redesign Madness, by tomgurg.

Are there any games now that do this? Do you think that players could even be trusted to keep secrets without the guiding hand of a GM? My instincts say that this should definitely be possible, but I can't really think of anything that could be done about it. So, what do you think? Is a GM necessary to keep secrets, or is there another way?</blockquote>\nMy latest design, Downfall, is GMless and inspired by Polaris. It's not a mystery, but there is an element of secrecy in the game. Players act in turns as narrators of their protagonist's adventures, other players act as antagonists providing adversity and increasing the drama. Each antagonist must chose at character creation three traits of the protagonist (each player chooses three for each of the other players' characters) that are "marked". As a result of conflict resolution some of the protagonist's traits will move towards exhaustion and when they are completely exhausted the antagonists must reveal if the exhausted trait was marked or not, if it is marked by all of them the protagonist's story must end. So the antagonists must somehow coordinate their efforts (without explicitly talking about it) to exhaust a trait marked by all of them and the protagonist must try to guess which of his traits are safe to exhaust and which aren't. This mechanic could be applied to a murder mystery, with multiple GMs and a single protagonist (in a Dirty Secrets like arrangement) the GMs want to build tension towards their secret choices and when the protagonist does something (e.g. make a formal accusation) all the GMs reveal if the accused is guilty or not.<br/><br/>What I like about this mechanics is the mutual lack of knowledge. Nobody knows the full story and only using indirect means information is shared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
