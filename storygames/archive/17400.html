I have a bunch of friends with whom I regularly meet, first to plan and organize activities in the community (mostly to raise awareness of social and environmental issues) and then play board games. I've been meaning to try introducing story games to the group. Some have never roleplayed before, one is a regular player at the Lord of the Ring RPG (Decipher) and the other has roleplayed a bit in the past.<br/><br/>I'd like to start with something pretty episodic. It could be purely one-shot games, or it could be a series of episodes, as long as each of them is self-contained. I can expect a semi-regular cast. Most players would be there consistently most of the time, but it would be good to be able to play easily with a missing player, or an extra one.<br/><br/>Also, games should ideally not last longer than two hours, tops.<br/><br/>I like a game where players make meaningful choices and characters develop in ways often unforeseen. I like a system that rewards players for pushing their characters (rather than for being funny at the table - they DO NOT need more encouragement- or beating up monsters).<br/><br/>I don't mind crunch, but I believe the rules should be rather light/simple, for an introductory game (though I'm not yet ruling out Burning Wheel). Still, there should be enough there mechanically so it feels like a game.<br/><br/>Because I like to play, too, GMless/GMfull games would be nice. But I don't mind GMing either, depending on the game. In any case, it's best if the game doesn't take too much prep.<br/><br/>Any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394040/#Comment_394040" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T23:47:21+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 11:47PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394047/#Comment_394047" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T01:53:05+00:00" title="October 20, 2012  1:53AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel would be awesome as long as you didn't do Fight! or Range and Cover - stick to Bloody Versus.

I should probably fix that.  The two hours thing is also kind of a killer, but I'll see what I can do.<br/><br/>Games that work as one-shots or 2-3 sessions:<br/>Fiasco (GMless) is kind of at the story game deep end in terms of lacking traditional RPG mechanics, but it is easy to explain, fits into a couple hours, has no pre-play prep and often goes over well with newbies.<br/><br/>The Mountain Witch is pretty much Reservoir Dogs with katanas.  This was actually the first story-game I played, and it went over great.  Very low prep, rules-light but still fairly traditional, probably can't be finished in one 2 hour session but it does have natural break points between Acts.  I think this might be hard to get a hold of now, though?<br/><br/>A Penny For My Thoughts (GMless) works perfectly for a two-hour session.  Very rules-light and abstract game about amnesiacs that often takes surprising turns.  Might not fit the "enough system to feel like a game" stipulation, but has "meaningful choices and characters develop in ways often unforeseen" in spades.<br/><br/>Ensemble cast games:<br/>Monsterhearts only works if your players either love Twilight- or WoD-style emo supernatural drama, or think the genre is so stupid that it's hilarious.  If your group fits the bill, I highly recommend it-- in my experience it's like a greatest-hits version of my college World of Darkness games, where characters are constantly making or forced into terrible decisions that just keep snowballing.  I find it intensely enjoyable in one-shots because so much happens, but it works well in campaigns too, and I've had characters drop in and out between sessions without disrupting anything.<br/><br/>Smallville is a great game with a terrible license.  Kind of overlaps with Monsterhearts in the superhuman melodrama department, but is easier to drift away from pure teenage angst as long as you're still working with a tightly knit group of characters who may or may not like each other and may or may not have super powers (I've used it for an X-Men game, a zombie apocalypse game, and a game basically set in Amber). Smallville's group character creation is also FANTASTIC.  It eats up the entire first session, but it ends up literally creating a map of the entire campaign so almost all your prep is done.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is definitely episodic and all about pushing the characters to see what they do under pressure and what is important to them, and how the consequences of their choices change them.  I've only read this one and not played it though.<br/><br/>Special mention but not necessarily recommended: Microscope.  I adore this game, and it works well for a 2 hour one-shot (and is also GMless), but this one is definitely pushing the border of what can be called an RPG, since actual IC roleplaying can be skipped entirely if everyone in the group just feels like laying down Periods and Events instead of going into detail with Scenes, and there are no mechanically persistent characters.  Only check it out if you guys are feeling really experimental.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
