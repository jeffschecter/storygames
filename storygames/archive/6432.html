If you're interested in running a game at Gamex please go to www.strategicon.net, click on Events on the left-side menu and then choose "Run an event".<br/><br/>Game slots for FOUR hour games are:<br/><br/>Friday 3pm, 8pm and midnight<br/>Saturday 10AM 3pm, 8pm and midnight<br/>Sunday 10AM, 3pm, 8pm<br/>Monday -- 10 AM<br/><br/>Game slots for SIX hour games are:<br/><br/>Saturday noon and 6 pm<br/>Sunday noon and 6 pm<br/><br/>Game slots for TWO hour games are:<br/><br/>Saturday noon<br/>Sunday noon<br/>Monday 10 AM<br/><br/>As before, it takes 48 player-hours to earn your badge to the entire con. Player-hours are determined by the # of player slots in your game times the # of hours of the event. e.g. A 4 hour game with 6 players earns the GM 24 player-hours.<br/><br/>Thanks for everything and you can always contact Denys, RPG Department Head, at strategiconrpg@earthlink.net if you have any questions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
