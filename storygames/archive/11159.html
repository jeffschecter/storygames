Some of the images reminded me of games I wanted to play IN, but I decided would never happen. I think they're games that would require the GM to be devilishly clever. There were two pictures in particular that made me think of this.<br/>1) The picture of 24 (tv show)<br/>2) The picture of the House/Gordan Freeman hybrid  (one is from a tv show and one is from a video game)<br/><br/>To me, these games would require complex problem solving with intense, intricate plots.<br/><br/>Does anyone else feel like their ideal game requires a devilishly clever GM?   Provided you don't have a devishly clever GM handy (perhaps in your bag of holding), do you think there's any way to get these games off the ground?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247991/#Comment_247991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T23:38:39+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:38PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game I want more than anything is a sort of "Werewolf" variation in which players are con artists trying to scam either other players or NPCs. I actually started to think about possible rules for this kind of game, till I realized that it'd  require a GM who could either play such NPCs in a way that would make them neither too easy, nor too difficult to deceive, or else who could task PCs with playing these sorts of stooges in a fun and  effective manner. A total genius, in other words.<br/><br/>I have no idea how this might be implemented - would love to hear any ideas though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248134/#Comment_248134" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T14:25:14+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  2:25PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If what interests you is the "Problem Solving" aspect then ignore what I'm about to say.  If what interests you is the idea of a layered and intricate plot then I suggest looking at both Spione and Dirty Secrets.<br/><br/>Spione is GMless and constructs a Cold War-era John LeCarre style spy drama in Berlin.  There is no prep.  The whole thing happens in play.<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets is a GM-inverse setup where one player is a noir-style Investigator looking into crimes.  Again, no prep, the solution is generated through play.<br/><br/>These games don't need a devilishly clever GM because they harness the imaginative power of the group as whole.  Neither of these would give you 24 out of the box but the ideas in them might be adaptable into something you could use.<br/><br/>But again if *actually* "solving problems" is part of the appeal these games won't give you that.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248173/#Comment_248173" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T17:57:44+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  5:57PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David C</cite>Does anyone else feel like their ideal game requires a devilishly clever GM?

Heroic fantasy but rendered in splashy colors with mighty-thewed warriors, nubile women and hordes of inferior bad guys to slay.  The GM for this kind of thing has to be willing to just let things happen as they should and not muck it up with commentary.  Like I said, feed creative energy into the loop and let it grow stronger and stronger until the tone is just right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248184/#Comment_248184" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T18:59:30+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  6:59PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that you would find more fertile ground for a very intricate, detailed plot with a <em>GM-less</em> game.

Then, we do scenes leading up to that, and since we can see the goalposts, it's easy to avoid getting lost, even as we pile on intrigues and intricacies. Also, obviously, what Jason said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
