I got my copy via everyone's favorite internet book retailer.<br/><br/>It's very pretty. It's laid out quite well.<br/><br/>The language stuff that used to be like nails on chalkboard isn't here quite as much.<br/><br/>The setting background is mercifully short. Like "first edition, plus maybe a page or two" short.<br/><br/>It still gives a nod to the setting/rules bloat (sub-sub-clans and their kewl powerz!), but doesn't include that info in the main character generation section.<br/><br/>Combat is way streamlined (I had first and second editions, most recently played a heavily hacked 1st ed) and makes sense.<br/><br/>There are far more tactical options, so it doesn't seem anymore like "two dudes standing toe to toe, rolling dice and looking for 10s until the other guy falls over".<br/><br/>The way Void is laid out, I like it: It makes me not want to graft on a "fanmail" hack as much. I still likely will next time I run it, but I'll have to do so carefully, as Void is already in part a kind of Fanmail mechanic.<br/><br/>Did I mention it's pretty? There's tons of pretty art throughout the book, apparently pulled from the card game.<br/>========<br/><br/>I haven't read it too thoroughly, looking at things like:<br/>* How easy is it to create a character from start to finish?<br/>* How easy is it for people who have never played L5R to understand and enjoy the game?<br/>* How does combat really work in practice? Are the combat options useful, or just smokescreen?<br/>* Does it tell the GM what sorts of scenarios and adventures to make, to help her kickstart a campaign?<br/>* Does it give good reason why several disparate clan members might join together, which was one of the harder points to swallow from previous editions?<br/><br/>Anyone else have it, and have thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280027/#Comment_280027" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-11T06:46:54+00:00" title="July 11, 2010  6:46AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be playing 4th edition starting Wednesday and have already gone through making a character. Character creation was about as easy as in previous editions, which feels pretty burdensome when compared to a Story Games style rpg, but not as bad as D&amp;D. There's just a hint of planning characters towards the future (prerequisites for special abilities) that could make character development less responsive to the story.<br/><br/>Combat options (stances): these look like a smokescreen because there's no reason to shift from one to another. Pick the one that fits your bonuses and stick with it.<br/><br/>How easy is it for new players? I've found skill special abilities were one of the barriers for new players, simply because there were so many of them, and some players felt they needed to know all of them to choose properly. 4th doesn't fix that, unfortunately. If  a player joins in a game that has been going for a while, seeing all the special options that the other have accumulated can be both daunting and disheartening to new players. Not as bad as 3rd, but that's not exactly bragging rights. If someone was new to rpgs, I wouldn't start him or her with L5R.<br/><br/>Does it give reasons why characters from disparate clans join together? No, not that I've seen. Seriously, L5R's society would play better as a larp (not with these rules, I hope), focusing on intrigue. I may need to make up some custom larp rules for September, because I hate the direction they took with larp rules before.<br/><br/>There's a lot of rerolling in 4th, and that's going to make everything take longer, especially for IRC play. Grrr.<br/><br/>Oh yes, it is pretty, so very, very pretty. I can hand the book to people and the art makes them want to try the game. That's the power of great art, and it was worth every penny for that reason alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280228/#Comment_280228" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T18:43:53+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  6:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I picked it up in the dealers' room at DexCon, and I'll get to play it starting on Friday night!

A few notes based on actual play experience:<br/><br/>- Our game just converted all the characters from 3rd to 4th and kept playing the same story. Took a bit of math, and my own character was tossed as the Sparrow clan shifted further from how it was originally presented.<br/><br/>- One of the players made a bot program that merges all the rolling rules into a single IRC command. This makes it faster than if we were using actual dice. That helped a lot, but won't necessarily help your game.<br/><br/>- It's hard to see any reduction in setting detail when you're with a group that has been playing L5R for years. The one new player seems to be handling it all well, though, starting with just knowing about his own character's clan, and learning everything else as it is demonstrated or revealed through play. It isn't necessary to know absolutely everything to get meaningfully involved in the game. That's good.<br/><br/>- Getting groups involving different clans to work together is about as hard as getting a dwarf and an elf to work together in D&amp;D. It's not hard at all, but sometimes it can seem a bit contrived. Nobody seems seriously bothered by that, though.<br/><br/>- If you were frustrated by the strange twists that came out of the card game tournaments, then you'll like 4th. The game isn't part of that timeline any more. 4th presents most of the bits in a big toybox, and you get to choose what parts fit your game best and push the Empire in your direction. Big thumbs up from me there.<br/><br/>- The massive index is missing a few of basic entries. No entries for initiative or experience points, just to name two I tried to look up. Thumbs down.<br/><br/>- Some rules are obviously refined. Defense skill comes to mind, as it was a big offender in 3rd edition.<br/><br/>- Unlike my 1st edition book, not a single page has fallen out. Looks promising.<br/><br/>Overall: if you liked Legend of the Five Rings before, it's still L5R. I'm happy I bought it and it will see much use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282615/#Comment_282615" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T10:11:11+00:00" title="July 23, 2010 10:11AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have mine and the binding is apparently in good shape.

But I don't think we were actually playing L5R.  We were actually playing a vaguely Japanese, Pendragon Shadowrun mash up.  The Pendragon part was legitimate because the campaign idea was to basically steal the rise and fall of camelot plotline and transplat it to Rok.  But the Shadowrun part was basically because somehow the game became totally mission based where we had to figure out how to bust into fortresses and steal heirlooms and defeat bad guys.  <br/><br/>My favorite part mechanically was how the game mechanically rewarded balance between the stats.  Don't remember the specifics, But I do remember having your stats well balanced made you way more powerful over all than being lopsided...which I thought was a nice mechanical reinforcer to the theme...if it did make for PCs who were stat wise pretty similar.

So unlike other games, you can't just build up agility and strength to become a combat monster: Increasing your physical stats (by raising rings) also made you Smart, Perceptive, Aware or Strong-Willed.<br/><br/>I think that's pretty cool. Other games have experimented with changing the names of attributes (or even using the elements), but it always came down to "Oh, Fire just means Agility, it does the same thing". By coupling a physical and mental/social/will attribute together into one, it actually made the elements sort of mean something.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282746/#Comment_282746" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-24T11:17:12+00:00" title="July 24, 2010 11:17AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that how it worked?
