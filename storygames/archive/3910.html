Here's his pitch:\n<blockquote>I've crossposted this from my <a href="http://gbsteve.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">LJ</a> because there is actually some interest in playing it. Obviously we'd need a good few people but I wondered if anyone here is interested.<br/><br/>Here's an idea for LARPing. I've just been reading the Jeepform stuff. I had been aware of this for a while, but didn't know it was called so until I followed up something Emily Care Boss mentioned in her review of Ropecon.<br/><br/>I'm also reminded, for some reason, of the first LARP chilledchimp wrote. This was a Harry Potter game. It was a single side of cocoa stained A4 that was lying on the floor under our bed. We were in Oxford, expecting to play an HP LARP but the GM failed to show. Fortunately everyone knew which characters they were going to play and chilledchimp remembered her plot, revolving around a stolen snitch.<br/><br/>So I played Snape and chilledchimp was McGonagall. We refed and played at the same time. I took half the group into a room for a Potions lesson, shouted at them, docked points from Gryfyndor, told them to get on with it and left. When I came back 15 minutes later, Hufflepuff had summoned Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Another wonderful moment was during the Quidditch. We had no rules so players pretended to fly around and chuck things at each other. We needed a winner and one player summed it up perfectly, "It doesn't matter what happens, as long as Harry wins". So that's what happened.<br/><br/>This is the kind of thing I like in a game, players taking responsibility for the outcomes, making them the right and best outcomes, and not trying to win.<br/><br/>So here's the system:<br/>Players are split into two groups, Characters and Consciousnesses. The game will be exploring some kind of situation, set up at the start. Characters have histories. Conciousnesses represent some kind of emotional or mental state, such as anger, pride, love, hate, deviousness, procrastination.<br/><br/>Characters can interact directly with each and Consciousnesses can interact with characters, or with each other, but only when attached to a character.<br/><br/>Characters take their cues for action from Consciousnesses. If they have none, they can choose freely. If they have several, they can choose. Some characters might be able to resist certain Consciousnesses.<br/><br/>If the outcome of some action needs to be decided, then Consciousnesses decide. If no Consciousnesses is present, the Characters decide.<br/><br/>Consciousnesses attach themselves to a character by following them around. They wear some indication of what they represent, a post-it perhaps, so that Characters can see what is influencing each other.<br/><br/>I think this could, and should, be used for a Dogs in the Vineyard LARP. Anyone got a few hours to spare at Gen Con?</blockquote>\nAnyway, Steve suggested I cross-post here to drum up some interest.  We're talking about two hours and 16 people doing something extremely weird.  If not at Gen Con, then when?  If not you, then who?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87824/#Comment_87824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T13:08:01+00:00" title="August 13, 2007  1:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2007 1:08PM by Moreno R..">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will not be at Gen Con (20.000 km is just too much...), but for people who would like to try a Jeepform at home, the "Doubt" scenario (downloable <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt/" rel="nofollow">here</a> in five languages) can be played in an evening with no props, no preparation, indoor and with four players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted an actual play report at the forge about it, the link is<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23950" rel="nofollow">DOUBT, a Jeepform Narrative LARP</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
