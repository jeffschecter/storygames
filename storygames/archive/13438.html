So I have this blog, Go Make Me a Sandwich. I haven't been pushing it much here because it deals with sexism in gaming, and I really don't feel like having YET ANOTHER flame-ridden, poo-flinging thread about sexism in gaming here. Been there, done that, own the t-shirt. But here's the deal: I just got trolled ON MY BLOG by a publisher who trotted out the "sex sells because men like sexy women" argument. And I'm just SO. ANGRY. right now. Like, if I could strangle someone through the internet I really would right now.<br/><br/>I know at least one man exists in the universe who doesn't like cheesecake art, because I married him. But what about the rest of you fellas? If you don't like cheesecake art, would you mind chiming in here or virtually raising your hand or something? Because, shit. I feel like I need some moral support or validation or something today. (That's not to say women can't post here, too. Your input is welcome too.)<br/><br/>Fair warning, I reserve the right to completely ignore anyone posting anything in this thread along the lines of "but I like boobies".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303051/#Comment_303051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T09:30:22+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  9:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I <i>generally</i> like it (by which I mean: as a genre; I don't necessarily like <i>every</i> work of it), if not as much as I like hardcore porn. <b>But</b> "cheesecake" on the cover is not going to make me buy an unrelated product, such as a book or computer game...

It feels like a...for lack of a better word, "distraction." Particularly when the imagery is plastered on the front of the book itself (like a huge number of the D&amp;D 3rd Edition open license add-ons and supplements), it seems like it is advertising sexy women, instead of an interesting game. If a publisher wants to put out a book specifically of game-inspired cheesecake/beefcake imagery, then that's fine.<br/>In a game, I want artwork that evokes the feel and play of the game. I think specifically of Barbarians of Lemuria, which has a few images containing nudity, but in each case, they are appropriate for the subject matter of the game. It contributes to the "feel" of that game's fiction. On the other hand, I think it was some of the older Mongoose Publishing D&amp;D 3.0 books that would have images of scantily clad or nude women and faeries etc., with absolutely no reason at all except to provide "filler." That kind of stuff is unecessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/clash" title="clash"><img alt="clash" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/clash">clash</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303058/#Comment_303058" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T09:43:06+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  9:43AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My sentiments mirror amnesiack's perfectly.<br/>\n<br/>\n-clash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303059/#Comment_303059" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T09:46:28+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  9:46AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anna, I would point out to you that the publisher in question is LPJ and you really need to consider the source when reading anything he writes.

It basically just says, "Hey dudes, we know that you are so stupid that you'll buy anything that gives you an excuse to look at boobies."  So, really, it's sexist and demeaning to MEN as well as women, because it treats us as if we're all Neanderthal douchebags that can be easily manipulated by crass marketing attempts.  Men don't tend to get offended by people waving boobies at them while trying to steal their $$$, but that's a different issue.<br/><br/>If you are selling a game about Conan, then some kinds of cheesecake are expected (even if it may be distasteful or demeaning): that's what Conan is about, partially, and people either like it, dislike it, or try to deal with it somehow.  But if you're selling a game that isn't about reveling in pulpy fantasy tropes (and the sexism and racism that come along with that stuff), then cheesecake is really just using sexism to sell stuff, like they do on commercials for shitty mass-produced beer.  That's pretty terrible, but it's also ubiquitous, so I think a lot of people just become numb to it after a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303066/#Comment_303066" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T09:58:24+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  9:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael: LPJ can say whatever he wants on his own <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">little</span> kinda large corner of the internet.

I swear to god if I ever had to sword fight one of these chicks I'd stab her in the boob out of spite.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>One of the things I find so bothersome about cheesecake is that it typically has nothing at all to do with the product that's being sold.  It basically just says, "Hey dudes, we know that you are so stupid that you'll buy anything that gives you an excuse to look at boobies."  So, really, it's sexist and demeaning to MEN as well as women, because it treats us as if we're all Neanderthal douchebags that can be easily manipulated by crass marketing attempts.  Men don't tend to get offended by people waving boobies at them while trying to steal their $$$, but that's a different issue.</blockquote>\nYou know, I honestly hadn't thought about it from that angle. Thanks for the food for thought.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>I like the art in S/lay w/Me. Is that cheesecake?</blockquote>\nSo.... I had a conversation with Ron at GenCon about S/lay w/Me and, man. I don't know. Is it cheesecake? Maybe? Is it sexist, no. I've made my peace with where Ron's coming from. I'm cool with its existence, even if I probably won't ever play it because of my own baggage.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>PS where's the link to your blog.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://gomakemeasandwich.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">The blog is here.</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303093/#Comment_303093" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T11:17:38+00:00" title="December  3, 2010 11:17AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2010 11:22AM by Tristan.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have noticed that the more I have to suspend my disbelieve, the less I like cheesecake art.<br><br>Artistic liberties with some excessive cleavage with some otherwise cool, aesthetic and practical armor?

There's a data point for the marketers: you want to try to ferret out allowance and dog-walking money, go with the "gateway porn". If you want to ferret out revenue from adult professionals, maybe put up a mature front. I wonder which demographic makes publishers of RPGs the most money...?<br/>-----<br/>I'd say, on a larger view, what a wise, wise man recently said to his son:<br/>"ShitMyDadSays \u200e"Everyone thinks their opinion matters. Don't argue with a nobody. A farmer doesn't bother telling a pig his breath smells like shit.""<br/><br/>If this guy's post bothers you, then (a) delete it--you're admin--or (b) ignore it. At MOST, maybe a comment like "I suspect your opinion is biased by your revenue stream" and leave it at that.<br/>-----<br/>Anyone else find it funny to see objections to "unrealistic armor" in a game with a setting that has magic, dragons, and owlbears? Play Pendragon, with all it's realistic armor... and sexism and classicism and.... Probably another thread, though.<br/><br/>But I will note that there aren't many plain or ugly folks of ANY (err, either) gender in RPG art, unless they're Eeeevil. As a plain-looking guy, I take offense at that trend far more. But... I may very well be evil, so who knows?

I like looking at sexy girls too!! Don't you want to know my opinion?? <br/><br/>No really though... I love sexy pinup artworkz... just not so much in my RPGs. I have however, been conditioned to expect my genre artwork to portray the ultimate perfect male or female form (re: comic books, manga and frazetta being predecessors of the modern fantasy and rpg artist). So when the convention is to create artwork that looks a certain way, until someone comes along to change that norm (like when Bradstreet went crazy black ink gothic jo barr style on white wolfs ass in the 90s, for example) the convention is going to remain the same. Just need publishers and artists who are willing to stretch and push those boundaries.<br/><br/>There's also the problem with how women are portrayed in general. Until women are perceived in popular media as something other than sexy, we're not going to be perceived in genre medias as something other than sexy. We're lucky we get our sexy fantasy women with armor. And with weapons and shit. And sabertooth tigers (see below).<br/><br/>Personally, cheesecake or no, if its GOOD ART in an RPG I usually have a heart attack. Its so rare. I'll take what I can get, and hope and pray for more dynamic and interesting portrayals of women overall.<br/><br/>But I dunno, something in me just loves this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Vy0bl-4j_3U/S-hnvfqaHyI/AAAAAAAACy4/IEY2HETGCg8/s1600/frank_frazetta_savagepellucidar.jpg"/><br/><br/>edited for clarity: What I meant to say was: Yes, of course I like looking at sexy naked ladies, who doesn't?

I suppose I don't qualify as not liking if that requires one to not like <i>anything</i> categorized by outside observer as cheesecake, but then again if you only "like cheesecake" if you like <i>everything</i> called that, then I don't qualify for that, either. Depends on a more nuanced model of events than just setting up a category and demanding an overall judgment.<br/><br/>I expect that the above is pretty true for most men, it's a greatly simplified model of the world that tries to explain trends on a mere gender basis. "Gender exceptionalism" I think it'd be called in English. Claiming to like or not like cheesecake seems like a really hasty conclusion about such an ill-defined and wide phenomenon. Sort of like categorically not liking hats - I guess it's possible to say so, especially after a bit of experience with the phenomenon, but it's still a leap to make unless they can trace their aesthetic judgment from the essential hat-ness instead of merely the samples they've happened to see, if you understand what I mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303124/#Comment_303124" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T13:51:44+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  1:51PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>I have to admit I didn't know the term "cheesecake art" - that's a real thing, and not just a geek label?</blockquote>\nYes, it's a real thing, but it's<i>not</i>what the OP thinks it is.  Cheesecake is a very specific sort of art \u2014 one for which Jared gave a good example \u2014 and is not a substitute term for anything that has boobs in it.<br/><br/>Cheesecake is a specific type of art. For an intro, you can follow <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/brons/Art/Cheesecake.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. It's pictures of scantily-clad women, to be warned.<br/><br/>Cheesecake is ALSO a term used quite frequently in the RPG community to refer to the typically-crass "chain mail bikini" style of art. The type where adventurer women look more like sex objects than adventurers. It's totally a different style of art from what the wider world considers "cheesecake".<br/><br/>So, Sam, I think that's an unfair breakdown.

In either direction, actually: I wouldn't say "Ooh, sexy girl, that must be a great threader machine thing!" any more than I would say "When they put a sexy girl in the ad, it cheapens the entire experience of shopping for threader machine things."  I'd be looking at the things I should care about in a good threader machine thing: reliability, price, design, that kind of crap.  Having a sexy girl next to one doesn't tell me any of that information, and so it can't influence my purchase one way or the other all by itself.<br/><br/>What that ad IS, however, is EYE-CATCHING.  If it had been just a picture of the threader machine thing, my eyes would have slid right off of it unless I was specifically looking for a threader machine thing.  But because there was a sexy girl, I actually looked at it.  I don't need a threader machine thing, but if I did, I would at the very least be aware that hey, someone's selling them, I should see if that's the threader machine thing for me.<br/><br/>And so on that level, cheesecake works.  It works because most guys (and some girls) like looking at sexy girls.  It works because most of us like looking at people more than we like looking at things, and people doing something unusual (such as being sexy and not wearing a lot of clothing) really draw our attention.  It works because advertising's purpose is only partly to actively sell you a product -- most of the time, all it wants to do is make you look at it, and if that means flashing lights or sexy girls or having it right in your eyeline, they'll do that.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure why gaming art uses it so much (except insofar as it also wants to be noticed), but it's probably because artists simply like drawing sexy stuff, too.  Go figure.  I'm not going to get angry about that, but when it starts to get ridiculous (e.g. beautiful women in fur bikinis stalking polar bears on an ice floe), I have to admit that I roll my eyes and sigh a little bit at it.  I'm happier with gaming art when it's <i>informative</i> rather than <i>evocative</i>: I want to see what that city looks like, what a starship looks like, what that weird-ass monster whose name I can barely pronounce looks like.  I don't really care about gaming art that just wants to provide atmosphere or be inspirational; that stuff gets the same rolled eyes and sigh as silly cheesecake.<br/><br/><br/>On a social level, while I'm sympathetic to and slightly convinced by the argument that cheesecake is inherently demeaning and kind of ridiculous, I have my doubts that it will ever go away (or even that the people who say they hate it really <i>hate</i> it, for that matter):  the human sex drive is always going to be working in most of us, and that means that seeing hot mostly-unclothed people is always going to be something that most of us will enjoy at least a little bit.  If that changes (we all switch over to artificial reproduction using tubes and vats and what have you, or whatever), we'll probably see an end to cheesecake.  Or maybe we'll just see an end to people noticing it for its sexiness, and it'll start to be about the pure aesthetics of it -- it'll all be about shapes and colors and movement, and only coincidentally feature boobs.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>But I will note that there aren't many plain or ugly folks of ANY (err, either) gender in RPG art, unless they're Eeeevil. As a plain-looking guy, I take offense at that trend far more.</blockquote>\nYup.  What's with all the powerful-looking men with the biceps and square jaws and perfect hair and six-pack abs?  Where are the weedy-looking balding dudes in glasses?  Where are the middle-age spreads and the acne?

I was thinking on this thread again and it occurred to me that I can't imagine many circumstances where genuinely sexy artwork would ever be appropriate in an RPG (or at least one I had any interest in playing). Sex and RPGs just don't go together for me - I like my gaming PG-rated. <br/><br/>RPG art on the whole is generally pretty bad. Which is a shame, because it can really help people to "get" the setting for any non real-world game. Certainly I thought that most/all of the Pathfinder examples linked to by wundergeek were just ugly, even before you start considering the inappropriate sexualisation in many of them.<br/><br/>EDIT: Don't post when tired, kids!

Most horror gaming stuff does that pretty well, no complaints there. And I still love the Players Handbook cover from 1st ed AD&amp;D, because it looked so damn cool - that was how I wanted my game to be! The DMG was a cruel disappointment by comparison.<br/><br/>Cheesecake just says to me that the publisher either has nothing coherent to offer, couldn't be arsed to commission a real cover, or is aiming at the 12-year-old market. Until I've heard something to tell me otherwise, I probably won't even pick it up to look at it.

I don't think there's anything wrong with that (and I don't think anyone here is saying that there is, to be clear).  But I think a lot of publishers overdo it when trying to use that fact to manipulate me (or guys in general) into buying their products.  I do like breasts!  But that doesn't mean I like, you know, enormous gravity-defying basketball-sized breasts like Ivy from Soul Caliber has; and frankly, art like that has turned me away from many a product, whether or not I would enjoy it otherwise.  There are definitely examples of RPGs that I have not bought simply because I wouldn't want to be seen reading them on the subway (s/lay w/me is an example of this, unfortunately.  I'd be interested in playing it, but if I ever bought it I'd have to spend the next fifteen minutes adjusting the cover with a magic marker or something).  At worst, it makes me wonder if they publisher is compensating for a lack of quality elsewhere (that infamous d20 series comes to mind here).<br/><br/>Can scantily clad women on a product attract my attention?  Sometimes, sure, but at some point it's also likely to dissuade me from even picking up the product, let alone or buying it.  <br/><br/>In conclusion, I think I'm with Levi: I prefer art in the realm of the "Meh" to "Awesome" categories from your Paizo post.  Those are most likely to catch my attention and hold it.  That Paladin is frickin' bad-ass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303141/#Comment_303141" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T15:32:59+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  3:32PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2010 3:33PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan pretty much said what I would say.

Rumiko may indeed be bi or gay; I have no idea and would not care to speculate at this time. But yeah, she's still a woman who is padding her book sales with images of the female body. <br/>Still, Ranma 1/2 characters aren't degraded or exploited in the same way that some hentai characters and such might be, which is good - female characters especially are all too feisty (and skilled in martial arts!) to be truly victimized. <br/>It really doesn't matter who is what sex; that only personalizes the issue and makes us speculate about the inner motivations of particular persons instead of focusing on analyzing and judging the content itself, which is the real problem. I could be a terribly racist son of a bitch, but as long as it didn't show up in my work, it wouldn't matter very much, as it wouldn't be affecting anybody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303175/#Comment_303175" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T22:29:59+00:00" title="December  3, 2010 10:29PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I've ever heard the term 'fan service' before.  Huh.<br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is - you could interpret Paizo's stuff negatively or positively. <br/>You could filter out everything else and focus on a few oversexualized pieces of art (I'm surprised Anna missed p. 203), or you could - and Anna does, to her credit - give Paizo props for the paladin and the cleric and the gnome druid and the rogue and say compared to most RPGs...hell, most <i>media</i>, Paizo's doing pretty good.  <br/>(Though I am deliberately ignoring the cheerleader booth thing...I don't know the story there, but I wouldn't be surprised if a marketer lost their job over it...)<br/>So, since we're in a gray area, the CEO being a woman is a piece of evidence in their favor.  And I'll reiterate, from what I know of her, the oversexualized sorcerer--and Pathfinder in general--is not some evil money-grubbing scheme, there's no calculus of "we gotta put hot girls in the books to sell them", it's some cool geeks doing what they love.

Like that female warrior in full plate; she is VERY sexy in my eyes, partly because she is covered from neck to toe. Then again, I have nothing against bare naked ladies if the representation is artistically valid. For example, one of my games involves primitive tribespeople. You can expect at least partial nudity because scantily clad women AND MEN are part of the tribal atmosphere of the game. Conversely that Azteks image further up the thread is completely awful. Sure the Azteks may have dressed a bit like that, but I bet they didn't stand like that, or wear such an awful come-hither expression before they disemboweled you. So while I'm not against sexy women in game art, it has to be done without sacrificing thousands of warriors on top of a jungle ziggurat to the god Xipe Totec... er... I mean it has to be done without sacrificing realism.<br/><br/>I am, on the other hand, a very big fan of realistically proportioned women. By all means let's have a few stunning bombshells lounging around the place, but I'm also all for seeing the rounder type of the female form sensitively rendered where this seems appropriate, and indeed the painfully thin near-boobless Mulan style of heroine. I was a big fan of the new female dwarf artwork when D&amp;D 3.0 came out, for example.<br/><br/>But as for pointlessly cheesecake art, no.

(Evangelion's episode previews often had Misato outright saying, "And there'll be plenty of fan service!" And Gainax has always been big on fan service in general.)<br/><br/>I don't think I can honestly say that I dislike all cheesecake art, but it's <i>very</i> rare to see an RPG book where it genuinely fits. The best cheesecake art tends to be from professional illustrators (Dean Yeagle, Bill Presing, Josh Cooley, Laurie B., Chris Sanders, etc.) and thus out of the price range of most RPG publishers. The general vibe of their pinup art tends to be less "Hey, look at her boobs!" and more "Beautiful women are awesome!" (and sometimes even "Powerful women are awesome!") You're also unlikely to run into chainmail binikis unless it's as a joke.<br/><br/>But mostly I'm just glad Anna's blog is making me think about this kind of stuff for my own games and stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303217/#Comment_303217" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T12:03:40+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 12:03PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always felt that art depicting scantily clad women in fantasy setting was mostly dumb and offensive. It's worst if they are wearing chainmail bikini or the like. <br/><br/>There was one instance where I though it was at least justified in the fiction. In the Finder's Stone trilogy, which I've read as a teenager. The cover of the first book shows the main character, an amnesiac warrior named Alias, wearing armor with lots of cleavage.<br/><br/>I'm proud to say, my first thought, as a (13? 14?) year old boy wasn't "oh so sexy" but "man that's dumb".<br/><br/>But it was a gift. The story seemed interesting. I had read other Forgotten Realms novels before, and enjoyed them. So I read the story.<br/><br/>And in the story, at some point, Alias is captured by a depraved evil wizard woman, she calls Alias "Puppet" and makes her wear the armor, which is enchanted.<br/><br/>Alias escapes, and kills the witch. She keeps the armor, though. Her paladin friend doesn't like it, but it <i>is</i> actually  more protective than standard armor, due to it's being enchanted. So it makes sense.<br/><br/>But generally, I'd rather women in RPG art would dress like normal people do. Normal people who fight dragons on a regular basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303219/#Comment_303219" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T12:24:55+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 12:24PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2010 12:26PM by elkin.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I buy a gaming product, I expect to be able to put it on my bookshelf where random, non-roleplayer house guests can flip through its pages without thinking roleplaying is some sort of a chainmail bikini fetish.

(We can get into the definition of "erotica" versus "pornography", but I leave it to the etymology \u2014 erotica means "something about fucking", where pornography means "images of prostitutes") I think that removing sex from art, even just art that contains it as a central theme, would remove an awful lot of art from the world. It doesn't matter if I like the art or not. Sex contributes centrally to human nature, and one of an artist's primary responsibilities is to represent human nature.</p>\n<p>That this is not considered art about fucking:</p>\n<p><img alt="Modigliani" src="http://iacmusic.com/Uploads/116452_11_22_2010_9_25_33_PM_-_modigliani.gif"/></p>\n<p>... is a matter of class and gender that gets pretty ugly, upon reflection.</p>\n<p>Modlgliani rendered it beautifully and with love, and completely consciously painted a story about fucking. (The includes the viewer as part of the composition, of course; he assumed, because of when and where he lived, that he painted for straight men, who were the audience that mattered, and that therefore naked women appealed to "everybody".)</p>\n<p>My problem is that, when you make art that is ostensibly not porn but represents sex anyway, it commodifies sex; by claiming to address other subject matter, you a) refuse to make art about fucking, which means you b) bury fucking in your art <em>even when your art is about something else</em>. You can contain a finite number of ideas in a piece of art, and it's hard for me to imagine that choosing to represent Sl\xfct didn't cost a lot of other things the artist could have said about Norse gods.</p>\n<p>So, do I find cheescake sexy? Sometimes. I love Jared's image above, and I think Frazetta drew gorgeous women. But would I choose either of those to represent a machine part or tales of the Norse gods? No. And when I see art that <em>does</em> float my sex boat and it's being used to sell me something irrelevant? It makes me <em>mad</em>. I feel manipulated to the degree that I won't buy whatever it is, out of petulant spite.</p>\n<p>So, here follows my prescription to the world. World, do my bidding.</p>\n<p><strong><em>More art about fucking</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>More art that, when it's not about fucking, is about all sorts of other stuff</em></strong></p>\n<p>(Incidentally, art that indulges in indirect stories about fucking, and then passes judgment on its characters is particularly vomitous; that shit will throw me into a rage. Somehow, it's only ever attractive women who receive such artistic judgment.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Just go through Reaper's online store, and you'll come away with a handful at best that aren't half naked, busting out of their tops or wearing clothing that seems to be disnintegrating.

I didn't want to punch myself in the face. If this post seems to categorize me as a someone who is just being difficult, then you're misunderstanding me. If it seems, as you said, Anna, "provocative," good. I think it can be good to provoke during a lively discussion. I hope we can have a lively discussion here.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think the intellectualization of titillation can only go so far before both the intellectualization and the titillation become silly. I'm not crazy, though, about the baked-in implication that men who like cheesecake art (whichever definition of cheesecake we're using; that's still unclear) should be met with disdain. What other forms of legal art should we categorically dismiss the fans of?<br/><br/>The thread title alone sort of irks me\u2014what if we do like cheesecake art in the vein of Frank Cho or Frank Frazetta? I mean, of <i>course</i> men who don't like cheesecake exist. Of <i>course</i> men who like cheesecake exist. Men are many and varied, not unlike women.<br/><br/>Anna, after going back and reading through some of your blog\u2014which was a great read\u2014I'm tempted to take issue with your characterization of certain female characters as "sluts" or "skanks" based on what they are wearing. That sort of attitude strikes me as being part of the problem, not part of the solution. And maybe I'm wrong. But I'm all for taking issue with artists who exhibit a lack of imagination, an inability to create according to the specs of their assignment, or a misunderstanding of anatomy... and, for sure, the wider the array of characters that we see and celebrate, the better. Absolutely, show us the fully armored paladin and her cohort the scantily clad warrior-man. Variety and equality are praiseworthy.<br/><br/>However, I don't agree with the way you come down on fantastical publishers for sending "mixed messages." Mixed messages in art design can be good\u2014they can be evidence of variety. Is the mix still too heavy in its favoritism of what you call cheesecake? Probably, though the right mix will be a matter of both taste and what's practically possible on real-world deadlines. Subpar art gets published for practical, ugly reasons, sometimes. People disagree on what's good. Pinning it down can kill it. So it goes.<br/><br/>This is my way of engaging with the material I've read from your blog, but it's only part of it. The other part of my engagement is this: Absolutely, I think you should be using your eye and your head and your heart to challenge that art you find weak or offensive or subpar. If you can raise the bar by drawing attention to the issue, more power to you. If you can raise the debate, challenge fantasy fans to examine their own tastes and think critically about what they consume and why, that is excellent. <br/><br/>At the same time, though, people are going to continue to find scantily clad figures\u2014male or female\u2014pleasing. Also, water is wet. People are going to examine what they like and some of them are going to discover that they like bomber girls, fireman calendars, and sexy barbarians. Some of those people? They're also going to like\u2014and create!\u2014things that you might find valuable.<br/><br/>Now I'm off to punch myself in the face. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel" title="michael.harrel"><img alt="michael.harrel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel">michael.harrel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303244/#Comment_303244" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T15:14:33+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  3:14PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

One of the chapters is entitled "It's All About Sex," and talks about finding sexual imagery in literature, phallic symbols and so forth.

I assume you don't mean that artists and other creative types shouldn't use sex as a metaphor or a reference point to talk about other things as well?  Do you mean "commodifies" strictly in the cases where they're trying to sell a product using sex, or in a broader sense than that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303261/#Comment_303261" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T19:08:53+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  7:08PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2010 7:09PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a cover of a book I frequently see on the shelf at Endgame:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.arcaneminiatures.co.uk/images/anima-tactics-miniatures/CST0003.jpg"/><br/><br/>And I often point it out to people.

It feels (I use "feels" nontrivially \u2014\xa0I've thoroughly interrogated this feeling) like selling something by using the American flag or a picture of Jesus. It frivolously uses your association with something that you consider symbolically weighty, maybe even holy, for something you haven't agreed to.</p>\n<p>I don't allow anyone to have sex with me whom I don't like. I'm pretty strict about that rule, actually. Performing sex acts in front of me <em>is</em> having sex with me (obviously at the dry end of the continuum). I don't like strip clubs at all, but if I'm in one, I've chosen to be there, and the dancers have chosen to be there, so it's OK (let's assume this as an axiom). But, like I said, I don't like strip clubs. They depress me. I've known a happy stripper or three, but I'm inherently not part of the target audience because I've known too many unhappy ones. Being in a club makes me participate in sex I don't want, to satisfy a social obligation, and that's not OK with me. If a friend makes me <em>stay</em> in a strip club, that friend is pressuring me to have sex with a stranger and them, at least a little.</p>\n<p>In the slightly drier direction, there's sex that a publishing company thrusts at me to sell me imaginary adventures in Sweden (much unlike my real adventures with Swedes, which, frankly, were pretty awesome).</p>\n<p>Now, think back to a really positive sexual experience you've had. The publisher doesn't know what that experience was, so they cast a broad net by using broadly recognizable, commercially acceptable sexuality to remind you of it. It's insulting to my actual experience. It's like McDonald's telling me how mouth-watering their meals are. Only the eating (and cooking) is deeply personal and has huge interpersonal ramifications.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I assume you don't mean that artists and other creative types shouldn't use sex as a metaphor or a reference point to talk about other things as well?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Absolutely not! That's the opposite of what I mean.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Do you mean "commodifies" strictly in the cases where they're trying to sell a product using sex, or in a broader sense than that?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I mean, in order to sell with sex, a designer/illustrator/publisher constructs a normative sexual experience designed around particular social expectations. If we were discussing something other than sex, something that people did publicly but with personal impact (like eating), it would matter less, because you'd see a variety of experiences; but because we'<br/>\nre so private about sex, it has to demonstrate a sexuality that doesn't exist, that neither represents the actual sexuality of the artist (see the "artists are pervs, so I edit them" comment in Anna's comment thread), nor does it accurately represent the sexuality of the people it's selling to (because it wasn't created by them, and all the artist knows is what's "worked" in the past).</p>\n<p>People have a lot of characteristics and do a lot of things. They all interest me, including, but not exclusively, the sexy ones. When the only thing that will appeal to me about a book is that it statistically appeals to me as a male who likes to have sex with females, that's a pretty serious condemnation of the content, and it's insulting me by selling me part of my core identity. But it adds insult to injury by trying to have sex with me against my will.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303266/#Comment_303266" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T20:43:04+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  8:43PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2010 12:10AM by DannyK.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of an award for non-sexist gaming material, maybe even a gaming Lambda or Tiptree award!<br/><br/>EDIT: But don't call it "Women's Choice"!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303269/#Comment_303269" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T22:20:40+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 10:20PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite><br/>I'll notice when there is tasteful or particularly utilitarian piece, however, because they are less common.

Of <i>course</i> you should be speaking out against art that offends you, doesn't meet your standards, or that you feel does you damage. I encouraged you to do so in my first post. We're not always going to agree where the line is, though, are we?<br/><br/>Looking back at your first post, though, I see that I've engaged with your blog rather than your post. So what I've done is to sort of derail the thread. That's my fault. I apologize if I've brought angst when what you were looking for is support. So I'll raise my hand, virtually, because what you wanted to know is if there are men who dislike cheesecake art. I dislike lots of cheesecake art, but not all of it. Count my vote however you will.<br/><br/>I don't think there are only two sides to this argument, though, because it's about art. I can simultaneously appreciate nose art and think that those squatting-Viking covers are absurd and embarrassing. (I'm doing it right now.) So how should I vote in your binary poll? Do I have to either applaud with my mouth shut or be characterized by Joshua as a screaming miscreant? Are those my only options? (<i>Edit</i>: I'm not asking just Anna here, obviously, as her reaction to my post didn't characterize me as a screaming miscreant.)<br/><br/>As I said, I may well be wrong. I'm not finished making me, yet, so I'm sure to be ignorant or mistaken on some things. So it goes.<br/><br/><i>Edit:</i> Because my comment won't seem to go through on your blog, I wanted to also say here that the discussion going on over there is a great, practical talk about a difficult topic.

I enjoy it and I'll continue to read it but its value is diminished for me somewhat because I feel like it has, so far, too much emphasis on the catharsis element of its stated mission.<br/><br/>Without more context, without some recognition or treatment from you that you, for example, have some appreciation for how harmful patriarchy is for <i>men</i> as well as women, then a trip to your blog comes across too often as an attack on one gender from the other.  And people don't learn as well in that context.  Which is a shame, because I can recognize you have some great lessons to teach.<br/><br/>It's a problem for both genders that men are objectified as providers, authorities, and conquerers.  It is, in fact, killing and dehumanizing us daily.  <i>Sexism is dehumanizing.</i>  This is basic and that it is <i>dehumanizing</i> is why we should all despise it in all its forms.<br/><br/>I understand this is a bit off-topic, but I wanted to convey this "publicly" w/o starting a new thread.  As I said, I enjoy and appreciate your blog.  I hope you maintain it for a long time to come and will consider, at least, expanding its scope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston" title="MattJohnston"><img alt="MattJohnston" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cimota.com/slypic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston">MattJohnston</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303300/#Comment_303300" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T10:22:33+00:00" title="December  5, 2010 10:22AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a simple rule: I don't buy stuff with cheesecake art because it makes me look like some sort of sex fiend, which is only one step worse than a 'roleplayer' in some circles, but still.<br/><br/>It's just as others have said, it's embarrassing.

Not vanilla nonthreatening cheesecake carbon copies of naked bodies, but sex with actual social context and a hint of threat and power games ? Fitting with the conventions of the genre. Hell, I own a weird game I brought back from Japan out of sheer morbid fascination called \u7d76\u5bfe\u5974\u96b7 (Zettai Dorei...

I am a fan of the former. I love pin-up art, especially pin-up art as interpreted by old school and traditional western tattoos. (Disclaimer: I'm more of a fan of various tattoo styles than cheesecake art.) I also appreciate the absurd proportions of women in the art of folks like R. Crumb. I recognize some contradiction in my liking pin-up girls and disliking barely dressed, basketball-chested sorceresses.<br/><br/>I like sex in rpg's. Implied or graphic, occasionally front and center, and with variety as long as it fits the game and the story. I like rpg's with no sex at all, too.<br/><br/>I stayed away from actually playing table top role playing games until I was in my 30's for several reasons, but I one of the biggest ones was that rpg cheesecake art bugged me. I got a message that the games were not for me because of the lack of ethnic diversity and heavy emphasis on half naked women in the art. Seemed like a hobby for white guys. Moreover, when I thought of people who played role playing games, I assumed they were white guys who were into that sort of thing, and I didn't want to hang out and role play with people like that.<br/><br/>So no, I don't like the rpg cheesecake art.

Thanks for that, seriously. I'm perfectly willing to admit when I'm wrong, or made smarter after having been wrong, but I am not made smarter when smart people ignore me (however loudly). You're absolutely right that if I was smarter, what I would have done is ask questions. <br/><br/>However, I think the context of my statement is important: It wasn't categorically calling any argument "overintellectual and silly." It prefaced a post that was itself contributing to the intellectualization of a topic that doesn't necessarily work wholly intellectually (because of the emotional element, e.g. my own defensiveness at being judged based on art I've liked) and included my own commentary as therefore potentially silly. If that didn't come across, then it's a failing of my writing. <br/><br/>I think painting me as anti-intellectual, as you did, is rather coarse. My point is that we cannot necessarily address the puzzle of troublesome yet titillating imagery by outsmarting it, because that's not how titillation works. Simon said: "Images can be simultaneously ridiculous and sexist and yet titillating." That says it better. My point was that we can appeal to our intellects, in this thread, and recognize cheesecake art as "dumb," but that it's silly to think that will defuse the power it has over those who come to it to be titillated. We can use our heads to conclude that we do not approve of art that is bad, yet still have an emotional reaction to it. I thought it was precarious to sort people based on whether or not they "like" (for whatever value of like) cheesecake art.<br/><br/>Cheesecake, to me, is not synonymous with badly rendered, sexist fantasy-genre illustration. Bad cheesecake is bad. If it's clarifying for me to say that I don't like bad art, obvious as that sounds, I don't like bad art. Now we can start another thread to go around and around on what "bad" and "art" mean, if you want.<br/><br/><i>Edit:</i> Maybe titillation is too loaded a word. I'm happy to use a good alternative. And maybe all of this is foolish of me. So it goes.\n<blockquote><p>You don't have a particular position of wisdom, knowledge, or authority in this discussion.</p></blockquote>\nWell, now I know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303376/#Comment_303376" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T03:00:32+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  3:00AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

I just want to make a quick point since I've gotten a lot of messages about this.<br/><br/>Guys (and gals), I don't care if you like cheesecake. I asked if there were men who didn't like cheesecake because proving a negative is harder than proving a positive, and I was trying to disprove the statement that ALL MEN LIKE CHEESECAKE. If you like cheesecake, good for you. I'm honestly not judging you; that's a matter of personal taste. I also recognize that there isn't just a binary between "I like cheesecake" and "I don't like cheesecake" and I respect that too. I'm not going to get into the business of judging individual consumers of media for their tastes, because that's just counterproductive and hypocritical. <br/><br/>I'm reserving judgement for the artists, writers, and publishers who use cheesecake to make money. These are the people who are intentionally marginalizing women and perpetuating stereotypes for the sake of making a few quick bucks, and these are the people that deserve to be called out publicly on their bullshit. I'm not against all sex ever in RPGs. I'm not against all sex ever in art. I'm not against all people ever who like sexy art, or who like sex, or who like sex and RPGs. I'm against people who purposefully, deliberately, and systematically dehumanize women for personal gain and profit.<br/><br/>That is all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303400/#Comment_303400" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T08:57:37+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  8:57AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know...I pretty much assume all game publications are shit regardless of the cover art. And I like cheesy, arguably exploitative cheesecake art -- one of my most prized possessions is my grandfather's collection of Vargas bomber-nose lithos. I'm quite sure the presence of cheesecake-style exploitative girlie art on a game book does not persuade me away from my default assumptions, which is that the book is most likely shit. Nor would it make me think it was even shittier than it (probably) already is.<br/><br/>What cheesecake art does do for me, though, is reinforce the notion that publishers view RPGs as a fundamentally juvenile activity. I feel a little silly considering the purchase of a work offered by someone who actually thinks the cover girlie is going to win me over, draw my eye, whatever. FWIW I feel the same way about buying a copy of Maxim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303414/#Comment_303414" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T09:56:12+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  9:56AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to add a another data point:<br/><br/>I like sexy art, but only if it is done really well. I like the barbarian girl with the two saber-toothed tigers on the first page of this discussion, for example, much better than any of the other "examples" we're talking about. Because I like the colours, lines, etc: it's a drawing that has attitude and style.<br/><br/>Bad art that's trying really hard to be sexy, however, is enough to drive me away from just about <i>anything</i> (except maybe a blog making fun of said "art"!).<br/><br/>What we're calling "cheesecake" here is bad enough to drive me away from games, for sure: I've never bought anything game-related with that kind of art, nor do I plan on doing so unless I really, really have no choice. It just seems stupid, to me. Like a terrible font choice or similar mistake, but much, much worse in its implications.<br/><br/>In my <b>games</b>, I like art that shows interesting details about the fiction at work, evokes a powerful sense of place or emotion: you know, has purpose.<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/><br/>In Tavis's excellent blog post (<a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/contemporary-art-and-rpg-illustration/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/contemporary-art-and-rpg-illustration/</a>), I love the very first illustration he's posted. It reminds me of the art I really liked looking at when I was a kid getting into D&amp;D. It shows all kinds of detail that makes what is depicted seem *real*, explorable, interesting. <br/><br/>However, even in that picture, I find the elf on the left to seem a little "tacked on". I just tried covering her up with my hand while looking at the rest of the picture, and it seems to improve its composition. (Maybe they told the artist to add in a female elf somewhere towards the end of the process? I don't know. It may be a total coincidence that she's showing some leg.)<br/><br/>If you want me to buy your game, only include sexy art when you're depicting something that's supposed to be sexy. And, ideally, don't put it on the cover (unless your game is about sexual material, in which case it's fine--but make sure it's *good*, quality art, or it just looks cheap).<br/><br/>Really, though, if you want to be sexy with your game, I'll be more impressed if you use words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior" title="14thWarrior"><img alt="14thWarrior" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.netflash.net/llanade/BHG_Avatar_Sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior">14thWarrior</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303421/#Comment_303421" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T10:25:04+00:00" title="December  6, 2010 10:25AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            McDaldno's opinion is pretty close to where I stand on the issue.  I like pin-up art and artistic nudes; but in the context of gaming, it doesn't work well for me.<br/><br/>If some of that artwork were published outside of the gaming context; I'd be fine with a lot of it.  Some of it is just too ridiculous or too warped (anatomically or otherwise) to like.  But in it's own context I could accept at as fantasy pin-up art.<br/><br/>Individual art pieces have never influenced a purchase decision so much as to swing the decision one way or another; at least not that I'm aware of.<br/><br/>When it comes to gaming artwork, I tend to evaluate it on how well it depicts the setting or genre and, also on the practicality and realism in context of the setting/genre.<br/><br/>Sexy is fine if its properly done.  But also, sexy doesn't necessarily mean exposed skin, cinched waists, helium filled boobs, or marble chiseled six-pack abs.  A depiction of someone sensibly and practically attired but who is confident, self-assured, and powerful can can be just as sexy - maybe even sexier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303455/#Comment_303455" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T13:12:34+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  1:12PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I dunno.

For instance, I'm pretty sure that I never bought any RPG because the cover art or illustrations were good, but for sure bad art has turned off my curiosity on many books and games, so indirectly illustrations have had an impact on my buying patterns. To give an example, Castle Falkenstein was the game where the art had the most impact in my decision to buy the book, I found the illustrations really evocative of setting.<br/><br/>More importantly, and like someone mentioned before (the coke branding thing), I don't think anyone would really by a book just because of some cheesecacke illustration, but for sure it can be very efficient in grabbing mindshare. Nowadays I often don't even care much about illustrations in an RPG, but that's besides the point. To understand fan service, I think you have to put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience, adolescent boys.<br/><br/>I remember that when I was a teen, I started roleplaying with RuneQuest. One of the supplements I bought had an ad at the end of the book with the following illustration:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://nsa19.casimages.com/img/2010/12/10/101210080928794360.png"/><br/><br/>I for sure I did not buy the book because of the pic, since I only saw it when reading it, and at the beginning did not particularly think much of it. But the dam thing burned itself into my brain - I would often think about it - and from time to time I  would fetch the book just to see it again (and I'm serious when I mean just to look at it). At the time, I was already embarrassed about it: there is nothing special about this illustration, it's pretty basic, the posture is forced, and as usual it's totally unrealistic and nonsensical. If one had to obsess about a picture, why such a cheap one? (T_T' )I don't think one can really decide on these things.<br/><br/>Anyways, the imprinting was so efficient that twenty years later when reading this thread I immediately thought about that picture and opened that book again (probably for the first time in these last ten years) to take a photo of it.<br/>My opinion is still the same: a generic fan service piece, totally unworthy of the commotion it generated. On the other hand, when I think about how mild it is, it's perhaps lucky I did not have access to the internet during my early adolescence, I wonder what would I have been imprinted with otherwise?<br/><br/>In brief: yes, cheesecake art can be distasteful, offensive, or even work against the setting the game is trying to convey. But the point of those illustrations is not to inform but to captivate, and they can be stupidly efficient at it, given the appropriate audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303964/#Comment_303964" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T21:29:31+00:00" title="December 10, 2010  9:29PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look no further than the internet's derision of Rob Liefeld.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303972/#Comment_303972" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-11T04:09:04+00:00" title="December 11, 2010  4:09AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2010 4:10AM by Graham.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex, that's a pretty awful post.

I don't think so, but it probably depends on what you call sexism. In any case, the OP specifically mentioned that this thread was not about sexism, so I suggest we whisper on that topic, if you are inclined to do so.<br/><br/>What I can tell you is that I take these issues very seriously, and that in my post I was trying to address the OP question as honestly and sincerely as I could. The problem is that although the OP's question is very simple (Do you like cheesecake art?), the answer is very complicated, hence my perhaps poorly written and convoluted answer. Allow me a second try:<br/><br/>There are two problems to consider when trying to answer OP's question: 1) what is "cheesecake art" 2) in which manner and context is "cheesecake art" used. Depending on the answer to those questions, I could answer with a straight face "yes", "no" and "sometimes" to the OP's question.<br/><br/>What is cheesecake art? It's a term I did not know before reading this thread, and there seems to be a drift of meaning between the mainstream "cheesecake art" signification (pin-up style illustrations), and the rpg community one. I'm more comfortable with the manga/anime term of "fan service", which I would define as "sexually appealing art which is not mandated or justified by the setting or context": the depiction of a naked woman living in the tropical forest is not necessarily fan service, neither would be the usual "scantily clad" girl, if she's a courtesan on duty.<br/><br/>Note that if one would define fan service as "sexually appealing art which is not compatible with the setting or context", then I would for sure say "no" to the question, at least in the context of rpgs. Rpgs use a lot of suspension of disbelief, and by definition art (erotic or otherwise) which breaks the inner logic of the setting is a problem in this respect. But fan service can be at the same time "not required" by the context, but still "compatible" with it, and this is where things get complicated. For instance, let's say you have to illustrate a fantasy scenario in which there is a sorceress. The only thing you know about her is that she's a sorceress. If you draw her with big boobs, it's fan service, because it is not justified by the setting (she could have been flat chested, and still be a sorceress), even though it remains compatible with it.<br/><br/>Of course, it also depends on what you mean by "sexually appealing". No one will question that a graphic shot of a vagina is sexual (even if not always appealing), but for me an attractive face is also "sexually appealing". Faces, hands, body shape are all modified by secondary sexual traits. Women often say that the eyes and hands of a man are the first spots they appraise when evaluating a male. This is perfectly obvious and is used in a massive scale in the movies industry. In most of the movies, the script does not require or justifies the use of a physically attractive actor or actress to play the protagonist role (not all movies are about fashion models), but this is exactly what you see, and to me is a pervasive form of fan service. Can you say with a straight face that you don't like to see attractive actors in the movies? I can't, and I wonder how the OP's husband would answer to that question...<br/><br/>Which does not mean that I always wish that the protagonist should be a physically attractive person, on the contrary. One of the reasons I liked spaghetti westerns so much more than american westerns from the fifties is exactly because you started to see "ugly" people, or more exactly people with faces full of flavor (real brown people, big noses, wrinkles, etc). It made the whole thing so much more interesting than the bland repetitive wasp faces of old westerns!<br/><br/>I also do not think that fan service is inevitable. Fan service gives you buy in from the (target) audience, which is a goal in the entertainment industry. Of course, it's the lazy path to audience buy in. If you have an excellent plot, or a charismatic (but physically average) actor, you may do well with the audience, even though you don't use fan service. Fan service is not a requirement, but it can help, and it can help increase sales of a good movie, and minimize losses of a bad one.<br/><br/>Fan service can actually be a liability if 1) if offends or fails to entice the audience 2) is so clich\xe9ed as to become a source of frustration for the audience 3) the aesthetic of the work or setting themselves are really non conductive to themes of sexual attraction.<br/><br/>So, to answer the OP, I like pictures of attractive people in an rpg book, as long as those illustrations actively support the setting and do not destroy its coherence. I do not demand illustrations of sexually attractive people in an rpg book, actually I don't even need illustrations at all in an rpg book to buy it (APs and reviews carry a lot more weight in my buying decisions). But if an rpg does have illustrations, for instance cover illustrations, a non sexual but evocative illustration beats hands down a sexually attractive illustration in giving me a good impression of a rpg book. <br/><br/>For instance, on of the books I bought in recent years is "Mythic Russia". I find the cover illustration extremely efficient in evoking the setting, without having the least shred of fan service<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nsa19.casimages.com/img/2010/12/11/101211054127894147.jpg"/><br/><br/>Now the reason I mentioned the RuneQuest image in my previous post is that I find the consideration on whether "I like cheesecake art" besides the point in terms of why publishers place it in rpg books. I think that publishers of rpg books use fan service not to directly increase sales (buy a book because of fan service illustrations), but to raise the interest of the reader (mindshare) in their product.<br/><br/>And to this effect I can report that it works splendidly well, when the circumstances are right. I am certain that I did not buy more books as a direct result of watching that picture, but it is equally certain that I was marked by the illustration to the point that 20 years later I easily remember it. This is an unqualified success for the illustration, it solidly placed a chunk of the RuneQuest paraphernalia in my mind.<br/><br/>You criticize me for somehow implying that there are two groups of people, the "teenagers that are affected by fan service", and "us", the "rationale people". But the reason I took an autobiographical example is precisely to show that the same people can react very differently to fan service, depending on their stage of development. If I saw that picture today for the first time, I would barely register it, I've seen thousands of others like it, and my sensibilities are different. That's why when I answer the OP's question, my answer is only valid as the person I am today, which may not be very indicative with what is happening in the heads of the people who are buying rpgs books. Even if we remain men all our life, our tastes and behaviors are very different at different ages. For some reason, even though the OP divided the audience into segments based on gender when asking her question, I wonder if the age criterion would not be as or even more important.<br/><br/>You also criticize me for using the term "imprinting" in an incorrect fashion, but I flatly reject your contention: I'm using the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_%28psychology%29" rel="nofollow">imprinting in its psychological sense</a> as popularized by Lorenz, i.e. phase sensitive learning. I talked about imprinting because I saw that picture at a phase where I was maturing sexually, and so not only sensitive to an erotic stimulation, but also capable of storing the memory of that experience for decades. I can assure you that I regularly see plenty of fan service that I promptly forget, the only reason I keep that one in memory is not because it's particularly good, but because I was exposed to it at a "sensitive" period. This is exactly what imprinting is about.<br/><br/>As for your comment on avoiding taking responsibility, I am not claiming that I am not responsible for my actions. What I mean is that I don't remember ever buying a rpg book because of a particular illustration, much less an erotic one (GM screens are a different story). But I can't deny for certain that some erotic imagery may have contributed to maintain my interest in a setting long enough to cause me to buy additional books. I can't deny it because I don't know for sure in either direction, not because I do not wish to accept responsibility for it. <br/><br/>As for the suggestion of inevitability, let me put it like this. Publishers put fan service in their books mainly targeted to male teenagers. I was very impressed by a sexually attractive picture in my teens. Those are data points that you may accept or find nonsensical, but either way it's something that does not concern me.<br/><br/>What concerns me more is whether fan service (or cheesecake art) has its place in RPG books. My opinion on that topic is that setting evocative illustrations are way more efficient than fan service in getting "buy-in" from the reader, with the caveat that creating setting specific illustrations is more difficult than producing generic fan service. If the publishers decide to be lazy and use fan service, they should at least take care that the it does not hurt the setting coherence or alienates the audience.<br/><br/>Fan service by itself will not scare women away. Western movies and Asian manga are full of fan service targeted to women who are huge consumers of that sort of entertainment. I think this whole thing boils down to respecting your audience, and cater for its specific needs, if you want to sell. Traditional american comic books have often been full of cliched and offensive fan service targeted to young males, and their market was often restricted to that segment. Japanese manga are full of cliched fan service (often offensive), but segregated and targeted to different audiences. As a result manga publishers managed to expand their market not only to older man, but also women. RPG publishers should take the hint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13438/men-who-dont-like-cheesecake-art-do-you-exist/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13438/men-who-dont-like-cheesecake-art-do-you-exist">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13438/men-who-dont-like-cheesecake-art-do-you-exist/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13438/men-who-dont-like-cheesecake-art-do-you-exist/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13438/men-who-dont-like-cheesecake-art-do-you-exist/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13438/men-who-dont-like-cheesecake-art-do-you-exist/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13438%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13438%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Men who don't like cheesecake art.

People like Egon Schiele, Frank Frazetta, Moebius; they can do whatever they want because subject matter is basically irrelevant to me and they're all geniuses in their own right.<br/><br/>I can think of two artists in the entire RPG world that aren't total garbage so those incompetent renderings of ladies by people that have never seen a lady are pretty offensive.

In RPG illustrations too, sometimes.  I did a good chunk of the art for S/Lay w/Me, with naked chicks and naked dudes, and I think it's good, whether anyone else does or not.<br/><br/>However, I fucking HATE a lot of the same stuff Anna hates.  Because it insults me, creeps me out, means nothing to me, whatever.<br/><br/>I have been trying to analyze the distinction between what I appreciate and what I hate, and I can't come up with a clear explanation.<br/><br/>However, I know it started with Larry Elmore and Dragonlance.  I'd been playing RPGs for some time already (though not D&amp;D, mostly) when Dragonlance came out, and God I hated those bikini-clad women he painted.  I never got into any of those books or anything.  It was just pathetic obvious pandering.  I'd been perfectly happy with the nudity in D&amp;D and other games I'd seen up till that point, but that was a breaking point.<br/><br/>Maybe I'd just grown up to a certain point when that happened -- I'm kind of an oldster here at 41, and a lot of things that younger nerds have a fond memory of, I have no fond memory of because I had grown old enough to see how shitty they were by the 80s when they came out.  (Think: G.I. Joe, Transformers).  Maybe my feeling about Elmore's bikini babes falls into that category.<br/><br/>So I guess my contribution to the original question of the thread:<br/><br/>Anna, a lot of, or most of, the stuff that you refer to as "cheesecake" is stuff I think totally sucks, even though I'm probably guilty of *drawing* a fair amount of stuff that you'd object to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304382/#Comment_304382" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T11:18:58+00:00" title="December 14, 2010 11:18AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ed: I've made my peace with S/lay w/Me.

We're wired to respond atavistically to sexual images, color, and certain kinds of emotion-laden language.  All limbic brain stuff.  I'm not happy that sex sells, or that our marketing culture blasts it out 24/7 across all manner of media.  At the same time, there are certain contexts in which I'd accept some sexualization of the product as being appropriate to the market (sex toys, lingerie).  RPGs aren't one of them.  I don't know anyone who's bought a book for its cheesecake art, but comics also pander to this strategy; <i>someone's</i> supporting all that Rob Liefield Danger Girl stuff.<br/><br/>At the same time, I'm more inclined to forgive a cover that puts, say, a Red Sonja type in a Conan-esque sword and sorcery context than I am the pulchritudinous Elf Maid with the bare midriff on another book.  That's probably because I recall the old Frazetta style art with some nostalgia and harbor some latitude for a perception of genre fidelity.  Any hypothetical tolerance doesn't mean a thing when it comes to me buying a book, though.  I just don't care enough about art to make that the principal reason for buying a book.  Poorly executed art can discourage me from buying, though.  And like some other folks have said, an otherwise awesome book that sports a cheesecake cover is very likely to convince me not to buy, as much for the embarrassment factor as for the insulting content.<br/><br/>I suspect the real function of cheesecake art isn't to close the sale, but simply to draw the attention of what's perceived to be -- and may still be -- a predominantly white male consumer demographic.  And as a male, I do tend to notice that stuff.  I don't presume to speak for all guys everywhere, but sexual imagery kind of leaps out of the background for me.  Noticing it doesn't mean it's compelling, however.  I can roll my eyes and move on past the E3 booth babes, for example, but they've definitely attracted my attention.  I find that kind of manipulation insulting, particularly because I resent being susceptible to at least the surface level effect.<br/><br/>Actually, there is one book I'd buy for the cover, but it's not cheesecake.  The first edition of Hero Games Star Hero had a cover by an artist I particularly like (can't recall her name) and it captured a dramatic, even iconic, space opera moment.  That kind of cover works for me.

Or include it because it happens in the game, with the focus not being the sexiness of the character but rather "A sexy character who is doing the following things... (XYZ)".<br/><br/>I think that latter bit is the difference between the Paizo "good" stuff and the Avalanche press "bad" stuff. <br/><br/>Sure, someone can drop the "biological beings are attracted to sexy things by nature" argument, but you know what else? "Mature humans of most cultures are repelled by abject sexual pandering".

If "Western MMO imagery" is to be judged, and you go with the top 7, then put those neutral cases in the data! It sounds like you're only accepting data that proves your point, if DAOC's imagery isn't permitted--even though it fits the general qualifications--because it DOESN'T reflect sexism or gender bias.<br/><br/>Could you explain what you meant, or am I correct that you only sought data from sources that could provide examples of the negative elements of your thesis?<br/><br/>Edited to add: VERY good work, given the scope! Sorry I didn't say so at the beginning. I'd be sure all your charts are using percentages consistently--on one or two, you switch to raw numbers, which makes us do mental math (sloppily) to make comparisons with the other charts.<br/><br/>Well done!

Please do go re-read that paragraph that the population of EVE Online and DAoC combined make up less than five percent of JUST WoW subscribers. DAoC subscribers would be around one or two percent. So because of the numbers and because DAoC is a FIRST-GENERATION MMO, I didn't think it worth including.<br/><br/>This wasn't about soliciting data that could only support the negative elements of my thesis. Honestly, the conclusion surprised me - especially wrt to MMOs and D&amp;D. But if you're looking for reasons to dismiss the article, well there you go.
