I read it, then played it, and was amazed how polished it was. It was obvious how much work had gone into the game.<br/><br/>The second indie game I bought was Dogs In The Vineyard. Again, it felt very polished, as though it had been playtested to death before release. <br/><br/>It wasn't just those two. Other games felt like that, too. Not every game was like that, but these ones were.<br/><br/>Recently, though, I haven't played anything that felt as finished, polished or playtested as My Life With Master and Dogs In The Vineyard. I keep hoping for a real labour of love, something that's been worked on for years, and that's as good as it's going to be. But everything I've bought seems rough around the edges. I'd like another polished game.<br/><br/>(Slow and thoughtful posting would be much appreciated, as usual.

Most of the indie games that have been published since those days were conceived <i>after</i> MLwM and Dogs and Sorcerer, etc. were published.  So... you know... if they were the game you wanted they wouldn't be out yet.<br/><br/>I want those games too.

Because now you're working in and partially against an existing body of work, unless you hit some unmined vein like 3:16, as one example, you might be struggling to create a strong identity for your game.<br/><br/>So, for me, part of the lack of polish isn't necessarily that as such, it's the lack of differentiation between a game and its near neighbours.<br/><br/>There's also the fact that we understand a lot more about how gaming works these days and about the kinds of way to have players interact with each other and story and play. There are more games and they have a little less wonder about them because they are going over territory that has already been explored. Of course, some do it so much better than you've seen before and you say shit, that's how to nurture conflict without hitting people over the head with it (the aforementioned 3:16).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231321/#Comment_231321" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:58:14+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:58PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, though nobody I know is really talking about it in these terms yet, the existing indie methods of creating and publishing games have been under constant assault in the last several years, mainly from ourselves (old timers changing methods, swarms of new designers, new ideas about publishing like "ashcans" and free games, the volatile internet community, the rapidly transforming indie convention circuit, changes in distribution and retailing, Luke &amp; Jared working freelance, Evil Hat publishing games for indie designers, etc. etc.).  I imagine that, in the future, the games you're looking for may not be published using the same methods and channels as MLWM.  So you may not find them in the places you're looking for them.  People are going to have to find new methods to continue to enjoy the same level of success and attention that they may be used to, which is partially what's making a lot of old timers so crotchety, I think <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231362/#Comment_231362" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T14:52:50+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  2:52PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Penny For My Thoughts, Graham.

You remember the winners, but you forget all the rest.<br/><br/>But yes, as a consumer of games, more playtesting and rewriting please, less rush to publish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231423/#Comment_231423" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T17:15:18+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  5:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another point that I've been saying (sometimes more politely than others).  The Forge was more or less founded by a bunch of unhappy Story Now starved people (and I fully include myself in this group) who then went and pioneered whole bunch of designs to fulfill that need.  Those designs included a whole lot of new eye opening techniques.  However, techniques are play style agnostic.<br/><br/>What that means is that a whole bunch of designers with *different* play priorities than the original pioneers have adapted those techniques to their own priorities.  Alas the presence of those techniques in sufficient quantities earns the game the meaningless title of "Story Game."  This means you can no long just *look* at a game and know it fits your play preferences.  You actually have to either research the game or attempt to play it yourself.<br/><br/>My main point is this: if you play it and it doesn't deliver for you the way Dogs in the Vineyard or My Life with Master do even though it appears to have similar *techniques* that might not be a problem with the game not being polished.  The game might do *exactly* what it's supposed to do.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231495/#Comment_231495" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T00:24:08+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:24AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 12:24AM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>What that means is that a whole bunch of designers with *different* play priorities than the original pioneers have adapted those techniques to their own priorities.

Think about how many awesome game ideas get thought up during contests, or 24 hour design kicks. Some times I get the feeling that the strategy is to kick out as many prototypes as one can until something sticks and then go with that. The only problem that this situation causes is that with so many more games to playtest so many less get play-tested. <br/>\n  Perfect example would be "Danger Patrol" this thing is getting the hell played out of it will will probably be a pretty slick game when all is said and done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231516/#Comment_231516" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T03:05:18+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  3:05AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 3:07AM by GB_Steve.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, you are wrong. There are just as many playtested and honed games but there is also a large number of less playtested and honed down to not playtested and just put out to see if anyone gives it some love. Gen Con had about 5 or 6 outlets for indie games this year, up from one booth with 20 games 4 years ago. And as the previous poster states, people are encouraged to publish unhoned, unplaytested games.<br/><br/>So it takes a lot more work to find the good ones (for differing interpretations of "good").<br/><br/>Also, when are you going to publish your murder game? That was honed and playtested a year ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
