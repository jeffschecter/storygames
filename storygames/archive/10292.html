You use the tarot cards to create your character and define the hopes and fears of your character. The cards are also used in conflicts with the winner gaining the right to interpret the consequence card and the elements of the game produce a very rich tapestry which backgrounds the play.<br/><br/>Definitely a game that we'll playing in our group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228977/#Comment_228977" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T11:16:55+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 11:16AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many thank!

I think it probably plays best over two or three evenings. The idea is that you are collaboratively creating a complete, authentic seeming myth of an imaginary people. (2) There is a GM, and his or her role is mainly to provide adversity in play; the game is zero-prep and begins with a collaborative establishing of the situation of the world, the people, and (to a lesser extent) the individual characters. Once play begins, the burden falls on to the GM to frame up a set of successive scenes where the "spotlight" rotates from character to character, and present each spotlight character with a situation that moves the action forward and engages the player. (3) The neatest part of the game is how the Ganakagok cards inform play: it is almost mystical when <i>exactly the right card</i> shows up as a kind of comment from above on the action in the game.<br/><br/>The next episode of <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a> will be "Ganakagok at Gencon" and I'll talk about how Ganakagok runs, which is actually a really neat thing, too: to watch a coherent story take form on a blank white canvas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228992/#Comment_228992" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T11:54:24+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 11:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds better and better!<br/><br/>/P<br/><br/>PS: but, damn!

The main fiction-generating mechanic uses a spotlight character who sets the scene and fights for narration rights and Good Medicine, with other players using their characters relevant qualities to add their influence. The GM uses characters' relevant negative qualities and global Bad Medicine to acquire narration rights and affect the end game. Play then moves to the next player. This mechanic is very neat - it allows players to decide if they are fighting more for a positive end game or more for their control over the fiction, as well as giving all players the option to be involved, even indirectly, in all other scenes. The end game is determined by the relative amounts of Bad and Good Medicine in the world, in the village and associated with the character..<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it's easier to run than Polaris, its cousin-in-spirit, and I found it more "character immersive".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only possible issue is if one player decides to add their own adversity, effectively acting with the GM, and taking all the Good Medicine from the world and village. Our game started with lots of Bad Medicine and the first player to do a scene did just this. There is also the issue that players can supply their own characters' adversity. It's too early to say if this is an issue - it may even be self-correcting. We'll see next week.

Somebody somewhere once described Ganakagok as "Polaris in parkas."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>The only possible issue is if one player decides to add their own adversity, effectively acting with the GM, and taking all the Good Medicine from the world and village. Our game started with lots of Bad Medicine and the first player to do a scene did just this.</blockquote>\nI've seen this happen, too, as the upshot of a game in which one player framed up his character as a real outsider to the village, practically a harbinger of the end-times; the other players were happy to have their characters ostracize his, and I think the player took it a little personally. So he grabbed 12 Good Medicine out of the village to add dice to his roll. At the end of reactions, all of those dice were pointed at Good Medicine, but the player didn't have the heart to just screw the village and take them for himself, so he put them back in the village. It was an interesting moment, one in which the fiction and the social interaction were fundamentally entangled.<br/><br/>One way of looking at it is that, when that happens, you've stumbled into a certain kind of story: maybe a cautionary tale about selfishness. "You've doomed the world for your own happiness! Well, enjoy it while it lasts!" Really: what does it mean to have a "happy ending" when the world and the people are doomed? It says something about the social dynamics, too, but nothing that can be generalized. Certainly players are going to want to experiment with a new system.<br/><br/>One potential "fix" if it becomes an issue is to subject player's use of Good Medicine to the same sort of limit that the GM faces in using your Bad Medicine against you: no more than N dice can be taken in this way, where N is the number of players at the table including the GM.\n<blockquote>There is also the issue that players can supply their own characters' adversity. It's too early to say if this is an issue - it may even be self-correcting. We'll see next week. Also, I haven't read the rules, just played, so I might be talking nonsense.</blockquote>\nI think I understand the point you're making, but I'm pretty sure your perception of this issue is an artifact of how I run the game rather than something that emerges from what the game text tells you do. Because I'm one of those GMs who's afraid to set difficulty numbers, I tend to explicitly ask the spotlight player, "What do you see this turn being about?" It's a pretty meta thing to do, and it works well with players who are used to being proactive with their characters. But I recognize that some players, for one or reason or another, don't like this: they're not sure what their character is up to, they want something to happen to their character to which they can react, they need something more to play off of. In that case, the game rules accommodate a much more traditional sort of pattern: The GM tells you what's going on, and you say what you do. The trick for the GM is to read the PC's Change-Hope and Change-Fear as flags to signify what kinds of situations the player will find compelling. <br/><br/>So, for example, in one game I had a player with a "shy apprentice" -- he's telling me right there that I have to draw him out! So the player's scene started with the monstrous polar bear leading the unnatural animals that the People were placating with offerings of food demanding an offering of human flesh from the shaman of the tribe, with the PC accompanying him. When the shaman refused, the bear killed the shaman, ate some of him, and then made the same demand of the shy apprentice. "What do you do?" Once the player decided that his character would run away, we could go right to the resolution mechanics. But everything up to the "What do you do?" is me reading the situation card and using it as well as the previously established Situation of the World and Situation of the People as well as the PC's Change-Fear about having to grow up and take responsibility for the tribe to drive the action.\n<blockquote>But in any case, it's a good game, Inuit?</blockquote>\n*groan* but thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229798/#Comment_229798" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T08:15:58+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  8:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><br/>I think I understand the point you're making, but I'm pretty sure your perception of this issue is an artifact of how I run the game rather than something that emerges from what the game text tells you do.

It's certainly possible that someone will win narration and decide, in good faith or bad, that the card demands (or "demands") that something bad happen. To a certain degree, the assumption is that the player is fighting for the right to put a positive spin on the card while the GM is fighting to spin it negatively. But you could argue that the game doesn't really care who narrates: it presumes that the card will constrain the narration to one degree or another, and the real point of the resolution mechanics is to spill forth Gifts, Burdens, Good Medicine, and Bad Medicine. Certainly there have been times where I've looked at the consequence card and said, well, nothing much bad can happen there. But even if the player wins narration and decides that the results are catastrophic, it still means that he or she is getting as many or more Gifts out of the deal than he or she is picking up in Burdens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229827/#Comment_229827" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T09:49:23+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  9:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another point of interest is that Simon and I have Change-Hopes that are mutually exclusive.

It's not all bad, though. At least our characters are all getting enough Omega 3.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229847/#Comment_229847" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T10:39:35+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 10:39AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>So that'll be interesting.

In play, your actions can revolve around your character's efforts to prepare for, instigate, and possibly even fight the final battle. If you win narration rights, there's nothing stopping you from reading the consequence card toward the end of bringing about the ultimate conflict; the rules support even a tendentious interpretation of the card on the part of the winning player. Suspecting such an interpretation from you is in the offing, however, Simon is motivated to push the dice away from giving you narration rights; a cunning GM may even declare that Simon gets to narrate if the GM wins narration rights. Alternately, if you haven't gotten to the big battle before Morning comes, the rules outline a procedure whereby <i>somebody</i> gets to narrate the Final Fate of the World and the People. If that's you, you can say the battle comes; if it's Simon, he can say that it doesn't.  <br/><br/>It's not perfect, and it can be broken, but generally the rules do a decent job of letting you know where you stand. I give credit to Judd Karlman, who when I was worried about something that happened in a playtest game he was in and whether it meant I needed to fix something, stopped me and said, "Maybe I just lost."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
