                    ...which is a fancy way of saying that I'm thinking about bonuses and penalties.  <br/><br/>The core mechanic is a die roll that must exceed the current scene number (1 through 9) for a success.  Your die size scales up from an initial d4 to d10 or, rarely, d12.  Due to the gradual increase in die sizes, the odds are stacked against success on straight rolls pretty badly.  If you just phone it in you will probably fail, as well as slip your character toward suicidal depression.  Good times.<br/><br/>But there are a bunch of things players can do to increase their odds - injecting situation, reincorporating, including other characters in their narration, sacrificing important and non-renewable resources (their own and those of other players), and so forth.  Some of these just add color and excitement and some burn stuff you care about forever.  Right now I'm trying to figure out the best way to apply these benefits.  <br/><br/>There are die increments (in Scene three you roll a 3, bump it to a 4), which are powerful in early scenes and weaker in later scenes, but a sure thing.  These are also, in terms of play dynamics and at-table fun, sort of boring.<br/><br/>There are re-rolls, which are chancy but powerful in later scenes (In Scene eight you roll a 2 on your d10, then re-roll to get a 7, which you can work with)<br/><br/>There are substitutions, which change your d4 into a d6 or whatever before a roll, which are always useful in a general way.  Right now the "big sacrifice" (of which there is one per player to burn) gives you a d12 to swap with your die, or a sure-thing +/-3 increment.  <br/><br/>I'm sure there are other fun dice tricks, and I'm open to suggestions.  What I want to figure out is how to offer minor and major benefits, based on the degree of initiative and/or pain a player invokes.  Playtesting will tell, but if there are obvious statistical tell-tales, I'd love to get schooled on them.  The escalating difficulty makes it a little beyond my mathematical ken.                </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>Just to clarify, are you asking for clarification on whether a +2 is worth more or less than a shift from a d8 to a d10 (along with the relative value of the other roll modifiers you mentioned) in terms of increasing chances of success, or are you wondering which mechanically relevant modifications of fictional elements should be rewarded highly through die modifiers, and which should be more moderately rewarded because they're not as cool? I think you are asking the former, but I want to be sure (plus there's always the possibility that it is option C: none of the above).                        </div>

                            You can also add a die, Jason.  A simple +d4 can be very useful, and it still has a whiff of randomness to keep the suspense going.                        </div>

                            The former, Gerald - I'm just pondering the math of it all at this point.<br/><br/>JBR, that's a good idea for a powerful sort of bonus (an average +2.5 is quite a lot and a +4 is pretty much guaranteed success for most of the game).  It might be a little fiddly, though, since there is a unity in the die pool now - everyone gets two dice, one for each moment in the spotlight, full stop.                        </div>

                            Maybe this is a little Games Workshop-ish a suggestion, but maybe it's more important to look at the feeling of different bonuses that they're statistical outcome?  Honestly, you might say that +3.5 and adding a d6 to the roll have the same effect on the expectation of a roll, and on the chance of exceeding a target number, but the variance is different, and more importantly, the d6 has more suspense attached to it (contrariwise, the +2.5 gives a better impression of confidence.)  <br/><br/>For instance, consider the difference between making a sacrifice before you roll - the roll is important, so I'm making this sacrifice up front - and making a sacrifice after you fail - much more desperate.  And I tend to feel that the second failure hurts more when you sacrificed to try to fix a failure than to go in swinging.<br/><br/>As for completely different tricks, consider a flat value of slightly more than half of the die (if there's any variability elsewhere in resolution).                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>I think things become interesting in the later scenes. Take scene 8, for example, where you have to roll a 9 or higher to succeed (assuming that you actually need to exceed the scene number, not get the scene number or higher).<br/><br/>That d12 is only going to give you a 1 in 4 chance of success (it rolls 1 - 12, with equal probability, and you need 9 - 12 to succeed). Modifiers increase that chance gradually (a +1 gives you a 1 in 3 chance, a +2 gives you 5 in 12, and a +3 gives you a 50/50 chance). A reroll increases those chances significantly: a single reroll, with no modifier, gives you slightly less than 50/50 odds; another reroll on top of that gives you slightly more than 50/50 odds.<br/><br/>Let's say you had a d8 instead. Basically, you're screwed. You can't succeed, even with rerolls. But now the modifiers make a huge difference: with a +1, you've got a 1 in 8; with +2, 1 in 4; with +3, 3 in 8.<br/><br/>So...as a quick overview:<br/><br/>1. A die substitution won't help as much as you think. Even that d12 only gives you a 1 in 4 chance in later scenes.<br/>2. Modifiers help quite significantly: a +3 modifier really raises your chances.<br/>3. In later scenes, unless you've got modifiers, you actually can't succeed with some dice.<br/>4. Rerolls really help.<br/><br/>And dice tricks you might consider:<br/><br/>1. The Capes trick of rerolling, but only accepting rerolls which exceed the original roll. Actually, perhaps that makes no difference with your game (if the roll fails in the first place, there's no point in keeping it). Forget I mentioned it.<br/>2. The Breaking The Ice trick of narrating something bad for a reroll.<br/>3. Narrating to increment the die (so a 8 becomes 9).<br/>4. Rolling two dice and taking the highest.<br/>5. Rerolling and adding the reroll to your roll.<br/>6. Narrating something to swap for a higher die <i>after</i> you've rolled.<br/><br/>Anyway, hope some of that helps. If I've got any of the probability wrong, people are welcome to correct me.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            OK, cool.<br/><br/>How about the early scenes? I'm rather worried that the chance of succeeding is too great. If you think about scene 1, then even if you've got a d4, you've got a 3 in 4 chance of winning. And <i>any</i> kind of modifier (reroll, addition) is likely to make success guaranteed or virtually guaranteed. Specifically, I'm worried that success is so likely that it's not worth working for any sort of bonus.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Possibly problematic in scene one - at one point I just said "you succeed in scene one", because as it sits it isn't much of a challenge.  Two things, though:<br/><br/>1.  It *should* be a lark.  It's a month before the Rising and you're out cutting capers, smoke bombing German only theaters, painting slogans on walls.  Kid stuff.  <br/><br/>2.  I'm seriously considering amping up the overall difficulty by starting the progression with a d2, which adds a hard edge to early scenes.  I hate hate hate using that, since it busts up my polyhedral thing, but I may if it needs it.  Returning to a d2 on the grid (the very center space) at any point in the game would be brutal.                        </div>

Does that include drifting from the center of the big grid?<br/><br/>A trick that occurs as a result of Graham's suggestions would be exploding dice, with a range of explosion that starts at 0 or 1, and increases with sacrifice.<br/><br/>So, normally, you roll your die and accept the result.  But having sacrificed to the dice once lets you explode on the highest result.  Two sacrifices or a big sacrifice on the two highest values, and so on.  The result would slowly grow the improvement per sacrifice.<br/><br/>Is it worth doing some Excel work to get reasonable graphs, or would you rather have the graphs interpreted?                        </div>

                            Yes! Of course. Exploding dice. That makes the whole thing much more interesting: it'd mean, for example, that any sort of die could succeed that final test.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Jason, an exploding d6 works like this: roll a d6. If you get a six, roll again and add the new roll to the previous one. Continue rerolling and adding every time you get a six.<br/><br/>Judson is also suggesting we consider an increased "range of explosion": roll a d6. If you get a five or a six, roll again and add the new roll to the previous one. Continue rerolling every time you get a five or a six.<br/><br/>Interesting probability facts:<br/><br/>1. Exploding dice don't <i>actually</i> increase the probability of getting high rolls much because, in practice, you're still fairly unlikely to roll a six and, if you do, you've still got to roll something useful <i>after</i> you roll that six.<br/>2. But they make things more interesting.<br/>3. And they mean that you can, theoretically, pass <i>any</i> threshold with <i>any</i> die. In your game, you <i>could</i> still succeed in scene 9 with a single d4: it's just very, very unlikely. (Oh, actually, now I've calculated it, it's a 1 in 16 chance, so not astronomical).<br/>4. Smaller exploding dice are more interesting than larger exploding dice: a d4 is quite likely to explode (because you roll a 4 a quarter of the time) but a d10 will hardly ever explode (you roll a ten one in ten times).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Thank you Graham.  I now recall exploding dice from Burning Wheel - that's the only place I've ever dealt with them.  <br/><br/>So let me see if I've grasped this:<br/><br/>You're playing Karol, and he's rolling a d6 for his Vignette in Scene Eight.  You know that success is unlikely, so you have him harm the thing he holds dear to earn an exploding die on a 5 or 6 result.  You rolls a 5, earning you the right to roll another, get a 4, and he succeeds with a 9.  <br/><br/>Right?<br/><br/>Immediate problems I see:<br/><br/>1.  There is, currently, a limited universe of options for things to sacrifice or be rewarded for.  Not a big deal, can be changed.<br/>2.  Rolling a second die is, under most circumstances, a guaranteed success.  Conversely, perversely, it's sort of elegant that this exploding die thing would only become attractive in Act Three, even though the dice you'll be using by then will be large ones.                        </div>

Exactly.
<blockquote>2. Rolling a second die is, under most circumstances, a guaranteed success. Conversely, perversely, it's sort of elegant that this exploding die thing would only become attractive in Act Three, even though the dice you'll be using by then will be large ones.</blockquote>
Well, in scene 8, say, rolling a 6 on your first d6 will give you a 2 in 3 chance of winning (you need a four or higher on the second d6). So it's likely, but not guaranteed. If you're using a d8, then rolling an 8 will almost guarantee you a success in any scene (if you roll the first 8, your eventual total will always be 9 or higher).<br/><br/>Also, bear in mind that nothing is guaranteed at the <i>start</i> of the roll, so it doesn't decrease the dramatic tension too much.<br/><br/>Note that if you're playing with d10s or d12s, you don't care about exploding dice: rolling a 10 or 12 means you've won anyway.<br/><br/>Now...just throwing out ideas...there's also the My Life With Master trick, where a certain roll on a die counts as <i>zero</i>. The nice thing about that is that, however many dice you have, you <i>always</i> have a chance of failing. <br/><br/>So we could consider having the largest value on a die explode and the smallest value (1) count as zero. That might be interesting: it means nothing's guaranteed.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            My original suggestion was that you had to sacrifice to earn an exploding die, but that adding the idea of "explosion tolerance" (terribly awkward phrase that it is) allows for N sacrifices on a dN.  It also makes the late-game sacrifices more desperate: in order for the sacrifice to matter, you have to sacrifice more, since, as Graham pointed out, with a d10 a 10 is already a success in scene 9.  <br/><br/>The general form math is a little thorny.  Was up until 3 AM recalling my infinite series, just to do the expectation for the tolerance=1 case.  And I'm still stumped on one term.  (Does anyone remember the infinite sum of k/N^k?  Does it even converge?)  Higher tolerances are trickier, but I suspect doable.                        </div>
