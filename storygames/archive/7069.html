For instance, I don't like Monopoly very much (even when I play with the real "auctions and loans" rules - which vastly improve it, by the way.)  So, I spend a lot of the game thinking about something else whenever I get drug into a play session (consequently, I lose at Monopoly. A lot. I'm also rather lousy at Chutes and Ladders, but I'm quite good at Clue and Clue Jr.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same problem pops up when I run into certain standard situations in a DnD game. Divvying up treasure, for instance. I just don't care, so I often end up with the crappiest chunk of the take. I'm often in the worst attack position in the group (back when people still obsessed about marching order, it was a nightmare.)<br/>\nAnd as for the standard opening tavern brawl... I do whatever I can to avoid it (but the last DnD game I played a few months ago made it a pre-requisite.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the new crop of story games, I haven't gotten bored in Prime Time Adventures or "With Great Power..." yet*, but I recently played a Dogs in the Vineyard game that bored me silly. We spent a lot of time waiting for the GM to concentrate on each of our characters in turn, often for long periods of play time, all unable to add our own suggestions to the motley of the current turn or even to play one of the many NPCs the GM introduced or to participate by means of any of the usual diversions I'm starting to crave in my games. Also, I didn't much like the escalation system, so that helped add to my disinterest. (The GM really, really loved the escalation system, but by the end of the demo, me and the other players were either trying to avoid it or, in one guy's case, to successfully break it. He figured out how to play the odds and win just about every conflict before it needed to go up to the first stage of violence.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm not looking for defences of your favorite game, here. I would like to know what makes people bored in games. I know, I know, it's very likely somebody was doing something wrong in these games (it was probably me, I admit.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also like any suggestions people might have on improving this situation, although these aren't as important as I don't have any to offer at the moment. <br/>\n(All I can do is harp on some old theories, and quite frankly, I'd like to hear some fresh ones.)<br/>\n<br/>\n*I haven't really been able to finish a game of PtA or a full game of "With Great Power..." either, so I have no basis of comparison.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157297/#Comment_157297" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T01:26:54+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  1:26AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2008 1:27AM by AnttiKi.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>I'm also rather lousy at Chutes and Ladders [...]</blockquote>\nJust an observation: You can't really suck at Chutes and Ladders because it is not a game.

Oftentimes, you're not the only one. By breaking the ice, you can get everyone back on the groove train. "Typical gamers" tend to forget you can do this, but in my games with non-gamers, I've often been shocked by their willingness to say, "Hey, can we just skip this and pick up at the villain's castle?" Well, OK! It's often worth the effort.<br><br>This discussion also reminds me of a group I used to play with. They used systems that were... not entirely conducive to the style of play they were into... and scenarios that were often lacking, including randomly-generated "adventures" from some random book, etc. Everything was set for a totally boring experience. But they were really, really good at generating fun through their characters' actions. Whenever things got boring or uneventful, they would throw their characters into the most unlikely situations (fearlessly!), play pranks on each other, start up audacious enterprises (in-character), etc.<br/><br/>For instance, I was GMing one day. The characters were security officers on a space station, and a crazy man with a bomb was threatening to blow up the station--a full-blown terrorist in space. Well, one of the characters snuck off to find him, without telling the others, and ended up in a shootout with one of the other PCs. Another climbed up to an unlikely spot and broadcast a message saying that he, too, had a bomb and was going to blow up the station! He made demands that were a thinly-veiled parody of the actual terrorist's demands. Suddenly, everything was in chaos.<br/><br/>They would constantly create fun, crazy situations like that, and that's where the bulk of the "fun" in that group came from.<br/><br/>Another technique I've seen that comes to mind is starting up dialogue, in-character, with another uninvolved player. Like, you know, ask them about their childhood or plan a heist or something. (This one isn't for everyone, of course, and really hard-ass control freak GMs will probably object to the side conversation.)<br/><br/>Finally, a great tip from Pete:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pete_darby</cite>as GM, invite "loose" players to play </blockquote>\nHaving a few "loose" players at the table (or under it) always give you something fun to do if the game gets boring.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157356/#Comment_157356" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T09:52:22+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  9:52AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm perplexed, but not surprised, that many of the solutions boil down to 'play better.'<br/><br/>What about the impact of system?  Surely there's something to be said for the number of people actually required to resolve a scene, and the way a game interweaves participation from multiple people (or fails to do so.)

Either tactical/system decisions or in-game decisions.<br/><br/>Long processes that don't add any additional information or tension. Primarily a system problem, although GMs who insist on mechanizing everything can create this problem as well. How <i>few</i> steps can you take from tension to resolution?<br/><br/>Systems that don't allow players to flag their interests (or that allow them to flag only obliquely, or that actively obfuscate player interests) can lead to hapless GMs floundering around pushing the wrong buttons. Possibly also a setting/premise problem, if the game's premise is unclear. Side thought: Lacuna avoids this trap -- even though there's nothing flaggable on the character sheet, the underlying premise and questions are so compelling and clear that everyone knows what they're signing up for.<br/><br/>Followup to the side note: Games with unclear premises. Off the top of my head, I was bored to tears by <i>Nephilim</i> and <i>Whispering Vault</i> because their premises were so obscure. I also had a hell of a time working out what kinds of characters would fit with the premise. So nobody has any good character-making guidance and the whole thing just ended up a bust. I imagine an unclear premise results in some pretty intractable SIS problems, and with nobody on the same page you'll end up at least frustrated, if not bored.<br/><br/>Lack of "helping" rules. This jumped out at me in <i>Reign</i> most recently -- there's no way for a second character to provide any mechanical benefit to another character. <i>BW</i>'s help rules are exactly the opposite, even going so far as to bribe helpers with free tests for advancement.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157403/#Comment_157403" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T12:46:49+00:00" title="July 18, 2008 12:46PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>How might we alter games structurally to reduce 'nothing to do, checking out' syndrome?</blockquote>\nHere's the weird thing. I will totally check out of games, but not generally because I am not on camera and only audience, I'm cool with that. My checkouts usually happen when I feel that my presence isn't required at all. That what I'm playing really amounts to little more than a game of chutes and ladders. With loaded dice. Otherwise, when I'm not on camera, I'm usually very interested in what's happening on screen.<br/><br/>That being said, I think if there's a system in play where it's encouraged to riff off the contributions of others, that can help you pay attention. Like, in a game where you are encouraged to ignore in game but out of character information, well, seriously, what's the point of paying attention if my character is not on screen. But if I'm encouraged to use out of character information to create bangs for the other players, well, paying attention then is golden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157416/#Comment_157416" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T13:59:16+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  1:59PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That brings up a related, if somewhat tangential observation I've made:<br/><br/>"Indie"-type games, where all the players contribute to the fiction in active ways, all the time, seem to require more mental energy, or something.

That's why I think the smallest practical group you can get is three players - because two people bounce off each other, and when one exhausts, the third steps in (indeed, they are drawn in by the lull in conversation it often seems - emergent spotlight time, I guess). Once someone else exhausts, the resting player steps back in, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157455/#Comment_157455" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T18:43:19+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  6:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2008 6:50PM by Callan_S.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the main topic, I think the question is, is the goal just to have some ephemeral fun? Popcorn play?<br/><br/>If there's something you want beyond fun, like some insight or understanding of character, or in gamist play, some long term recognition, then you might miss this if you stop paying attention.<br/><br/>But then again, that doesn't solve the problem of bored players, if you include yourself as a player. If your just interested in keeping them occupied, by your own nature, your not interested in some greater insight or understanding (even if the other players are). Eg, if some great insight about character were about to happen, like um, the princess stabbing the hero in the throat after being saved, because she loves the big bad guy, then that insight/event should not happen because it gets in the way of the goal that is short term, instant gratification fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On a side note, character creation bores me. Purchasing equipment (pre game) even more so (I do enjoy considering equipment purchase in game to be quite interesting though). This makes me different to the vast number of roleplayers, it seems, even my friends. I get the feeling some people do the game part in character creation, then finish with the game there and just make up story on the events of that game. Like playing chess to a conclusion, then roleplaying out the various pieces and whether they died, are dying or are saved, what each piece thinks of the loss, etc. I wonder if people play character gen like chess, then just stop playing and start making stuff up (with occasional dice rolls for the impression of system). Certain even indie games can't seem to get away from a big fat character generation chapter at the start of them.

That's kind of a moot point because A) I can only play so well and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> if the GM is bad, sometimes I'm playing my best and STILL getting bored (because the GM is shutting down all my attempts to "play better.")<br/><br/>People kept spouting that "involve yourself" line to me when I complained about the lack of player interaction opportunities and motivations in the rules of various Vampire LARPs and Cangeling LARPs.

If you're not in either of the scenes going on, it's hard to pay attention to either.  This is because the participants try not to bother anyone, so they physically separate from the group by turning toward each other, and speak softer than usual so each half of the group can hear the people they're interacting with over the background noise.  If you find yourself as the left-out party, even the audience role is not available or at least an awful lot of work.  Since most of the people at the table are entertained, side scenes also have the effect of allowing much longer scenes (too long, I think.)  End result: someone is really bored a good chunk of the time, and they also get blamed for not involving themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni" title="First Oni"><img alt="First Oni" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni">First Oni</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157678/#Comment_157678" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-21T07:29:21+00:00" title="July 21, 2008  7:29AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, different people have different ideas of what is boring.

Kill it dead. A lot of Vampire GMs I played with were particularly bad about that. "Could you share that with the rest of the table, please?" or they'd all just stop and watch us. I mean, it's not like we were doing anything but talking in character a half a room away! We were even keeping it low key.<br/><br/>So, yeah, that's a great rule to write into a game. "Let players interact with eachother in character if they're not part of the main action and you can't get back to them for a while."

Two characters, one a newb and the other a fairly experienced player, were driving down a winding mountain road in a lumber truck commandeered from a lumber village full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance" rel="nofollow">Deliverance</a> rejects. They were being pursued by a Nazi ubermensch wearing magical jumping boots. He ran them off the road, and attempted to kidnap the more experienced player (henceforth known as "my wife"). So, rather then busting out his guns, and risking killing them, he kept trying to throw the newb out of the way and grab my wife's character so he could run away quickly.<br/><br/>Instead, he kept rolling really really poorly. Combined with the fact that I statted him out to be able to take more then double the normal amount of damage a character can endure, and the whole experience took almost an hour, before he was finally damaged to the point that he just ran away.  <br/><br/>About half-way through, I could tell the newb was getting frustrated and bored. The rest of us, who have more experience then she does, know that, occasionally, the dice just don't cooperate, and thereby make things slow and irritating. I'm worried this might be a deal breaker for this player and that she may start to lose interest in the game. Hopefully, I can do things a little better next time, and renew her interest. We'll see, I guess.<br/><br/>I'm thinking now that I should have split up the action a little, buy cutting to the other two characters a little bit, as they tried to search the mountains to find the two characters who were being pursued.  At least it would have broken the fight down to manageable chunks and given the non-fighting characters a bit more to do. That's my thinking for a situation like this.<br/><br/>I'm curious, however, what some of you might do in this kind of case.<br/><br/><br/>I                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158872/#Comment_158872" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T11:25:37+00:00" title="July 27, 2008 11:25AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2008 11:27AM by chearns.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>About half-way through, I could tell the newb was getting frustrated and bored.</blockquote>\nThis might sound a bit weird, but, why didn't you do something right then and there? Why not have the bad guy run away right then? Or have him take a bullet through the head by a mysterious assailant? Or have that be the moment that the two characters searching the mountains find them? Or any number of things that would have ended the fight? Because, while it sounds like that one player was bored, I get the impression from your words that even if the others weren't bored, they weren't having any fun:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>The rest of us, who have more experience then she does, know that, occasionally, the dice just don't cooperate, and thereby make things slow and irritating.</blockquote>\nEDIT: My words seem a bit aggro , but I was acting With Love and Directly.<br/><br/>EDIT2: Also, welcome to Story Games Ryan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158877/#Comment_158877" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T13:09:05+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  1:09PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's cool, I appreciate directness.

The two searchers were stuck somewhere else at that moment, owing to an aspect compel (basically, player accepted in-game currency to force him to do something that made sense for his character, but wasn't a particularly good idea at the time).<br/><br/>I thought about making him run off, and looking back, I probably should have. Hindsight = 20/20 and all. However, the fact that I really wanted my wife's character to be kidnapped, blinded me to the obvious. An NPC killing him wouldn't have been a good idea as he has the secret to one of the PC's amnesia-lost, military-experiment past. A PC killing him might have been cool, as it would have created inter-PC drama between the killer and the PC with the forgotten past.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158911/#Comment_158911" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T16:45:35+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  4:45PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2008 5:27PM by Callan_S.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>About half-way through, I could tell the newb was getting frustrated and bored.

The issue was that everyone involved (a scientist, a spy/demolitions expert, and a super-soldier) were all doing things they didn't normally do - the scientist and spy aren't really cut out for direct, close-range combat, while the super-soldier doesn't usually try to bring anyone in alive. While this could be a very interesting scene, I think that I failed to use the drama implicit in having three characters who aren't very good at what they are trying to do compete. I let it drag on and on, when I should have cut it short, once the impending outcome had become obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
