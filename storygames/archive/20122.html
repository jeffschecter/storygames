I'm good at drawing and clue-giving, so I often vote for games where you excel or win by making useful drawings or giving useful clues.  My friend Catherine is very good at juggling rules and numbers in her head and maximizing the point values of her actions, so she often votes for complex thinky games where we compete for the most victory points.  We all do this -- we all prefer games which allow us to prosper by our particular skills.<br/><br/>When it comes to picking RPGs, on the other hand, I've never had quite the same experience.  I have very rarely picked through the pile by going, "Ooh, I'm good at that," and I haven't observed my friends doing that either.  Maybe this difference is real, or maybe I'm just missing a similarity.<br/><br/>What do you think?  What sorts of skills allow you to thrive* in different RPGs?<br/><br/>* As opposed to skills that are mere <i>requirements</i>, like "have an imagination" or "be comfortable talking in a group" or "parse this rules text".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444519/#Comment_444519" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-03T09:19:29+00:00" title="April  3, 2015  9:19AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what comes to my mind:<br/><br/><b>Character choices.</b>  This is the one that most RPGs agree <i>must</i> matter.  You're playing a game, you've got some objectives, you've got some approaches you could use to pursue them -- which approach do you choose?  Can you pick the one that will be most effective?  Most interesting?  <br/><br/>I know I'm lumping a lot into this broad category, but that's intentional -- I'm most interested in what <i>other</i> skills RPGs can reward. <br/><br/><b>Rules knowledge.</b>  In many games, this is mere requirement, but in the arena of RAW player vs GM competition, it can become the key to success.<br/><br/><b>Convincing portrayal.</b>  Similarly, this can be a minor add-on in some games, but can become vital in games where the GM judges "what works" according to fictional presentation.<br/><br/><b>Genre knowledge.</b>  Being well-versed in the type of fiction the group seeks to create can have all sorts of advantages, from solving problems to simple "well played!" recognition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444526/#Comment_444526" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-03T20:05:01+00:00" title="April  3, 2015  8:05PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting question!<br/><br/>I'll brainstorm a bit; you let me know if I'm heading in the right direction or not.<br/><br/><b>Social organization/leadership</b>. Some people are drawn to position of authority and/or responsibility, and they really enjoy getting a bunch of people together and being responsible for giving them a good time. I think a lot of people GM for this reason, organize cons, and so forth.<br/><br/><b>Creativity/imagination</b>. Yeah, I know this sounds terribly vague, but it's the ability to keep pulling creative, unique ideas of the ether. A lot of gamers take this for granted, but a lot of people find this utterly daunting about RPG/story game play. A person who sees this as a strength might be drawn to games like Universalis or Archipelago or whatever: where you get to make shit up continually and impress your friends. You can break the mold, even when you're tired and the well of inspiration has gone dry.<br/><br/><b>Real-world expertise</b>. I don't know if this fits in your "genre knowledge" category - it's the ability to bring real-world knowledge to bear on the game. For example, an experienced military officer might be chosen to be the referee in a competitive wargame, or to GM a Vietnam war scenario for the D&amp;D Vietnam game. Completely irrelevant to some games; fairly key to others.<br/><br/><b>The ability to read people</b>. This gamer enjoys figuring out what makes you tick and then giving it to you. It can be positive ("I like to play the foil for Jim, who's always into these tragic characters: I know just what will pull on his heartstrings") or negative (the guy or gal who's just there to cause trouble for everyone in order to get attention).<br/><br/><b>Artistic skills</b>. Some gamers go into great detail with painted miniatures, drawings of characters and events, fancy layout/documents, handouts, nice character sheets, costumes, in-character diaries or letters, and so on. I've seen some groups which really value this (and it can be advantageous in-game, either in implicit ways, or explicitly, with a group which rewards such "extra-curricular" activity with XP).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444547/#Comment_444547" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T12:06:31+00:00" title="April  4, 2015 12:06PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about <b>simple Communication Skills</b>?

(Not the best term, but to me, at least, what Dave is getting at is pretty clear. In many RPGs, you don't "win" and "lose", but we still have a clear sense of someone who is playing well, or someone who is a better player at a particular game. I might be aware that Lucy is much better at roleplaying believable NPCs than me, and knows the combat rules better, for example.)<br/><br/>"Disguising a power fantasy..."<br/><br/>That is a bit creepy, on the other hand, and is a bit different from what Dave is talking about, because it doesn't contribute to the *fun of the group*. I mean, if you're better at disguising your own power fantasies, the other players won't clap you on the back and cheer you on for being so good at it.<br/><br/>So I don't know if it belongs, but it does sound like something that could motivate someone to choose to play a certain game, and enjoy it more (presumably by not getting kicked out of it!) than if they weren't any good at that skill.<br/><br/>Very disturbing to think about that.

I probably expressed myself in a bad way as well. By showing some controversial 'skills' that pop up in roleplaying contexts, I wanted to argue that the main issue is what defines a well-played roleplay, not what skills perpetrate it. <br/><br/>(Pop culture references can help you thrive in a game by increasing fun and the social standing of the joker, but they can be used for browbeating as well. <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFantasy" rel="nofollow">Power fantasies</a> aren't creepy, it's very common for both gms and players. But they're not innocent either, and often presuppose a whole set of unconcious thoughts and dispositions that are imposed externally on us.)<br/><br/>Hopefully this makes it a bit clearer - by thinking critically we can neutralize unconcious harmful thoughts and attitudes, disarm our hobby and strive for games that are not only fun, but also inclusive, sensitive and valuable. So of course it's a little bit disturbing : )<br/><br/>EDIT: To get back on topic, I think <b>teaching and education</b> hasn't been mentioned yet. I think that's a skill that is tested and honed by roleplaying. Teaching rules to others, educating eachother in certain concepts and stories for instance.

It's why I like swingy micro systems where everyone needs to be on their game to be able to adapt to the shifting circumstances of the game from moment to moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444569/#Comment_444569" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T00:13:08+00:00" title="April  5, 2015 12:13AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely another good one!

One of the things that's interesting about RPGs is that, as with teaching, no one of the listed skills is really sufficient. (Even though I agree with most of what people have already mentioned.) That is, the ability to run or even play in an RPG effectively is essentially a cluster of inter-related skills. To make matters worse, you have to be able to bring them to bear simultaneously or in rapid succession.<br/><br/>It's almost fractal, in fact. Because even if you break down the individual components of a good player or good GM's repertoire, even there you get sub-skills pretty quickly. What is required, for example, to maintain a good pace in a game? I can think of at least three things.<br/><br/>And yet, you could be good at pacing but bad at other aspects of roleplaying!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444573/#Comment_444573" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T06:05:28+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  6:05AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see whatever skill list you could cobble together, Matt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444574/#Comment_444574" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T06:08:13+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  6:08AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I think you've also learn how to play when not engaged with the rules and fiction as well.

If we're playing D&amp;D 4E for example and we're in combat, I've got to be patient until it gets to my turn basically, yet also need to try to stay engaged or at least give the appearance of still being engaged with the fiction. Not sure if patience could be called a skill, but for some games you need it.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure if it counts since it's mainly before playing the actual game, but <b>time management</b> to some degree - scheduling games, game prep, and using it effectively.<br/><br/><b>Story-telling</b>: What makes for an interesting story, structure, tension, pacing and group story telling as it's an interactive process so it'd tie into reading people and knowing what they want from the story as well.

There's of course a few creepy sides of this, like <b>allowing others to misinterpretate your statements</b> and later add further information that puts the statement on a different light... after the players have reacted. There are good ways to put this in use, but there are many more ways to misuse it.<br/><br/>Let's take a trap for example. You have to state what the characters see, but certain descriptions will most certainly put some players on guard, like "the floor is dusty". But what if the ones who put the trap were very meticulous about it? Well, logic-wise there wouldn't be too many clues to tell there's a trap, and yet game-wise you've got to be fair and offer players a chance.<br/><br/>Some GMs playstyle actually includes not giving any clues at all until players ask the right questions or interact with the fiction in an specific way: "I look at the floor \xbfis it dusty?"<br/><br/>The same goes for the players. They may prepare their spells and write it down on their character sheet, but some are careful about not telling the GM which ones they prepared, to take the GM by surprise even in games where the competitive component between GM and players isn't significant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444601/#Comment_444601" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T17:32:48+00:00" title="April  6, 2015  5:32PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Winning arguments in-character is a huge one, too, for some styles of gaming.<br/></blockquote>\nHow about calling it "Competitive spirit"?<br/></blockquote>\nI may have expressed myself poorly here. It's not just a sense of being competitive, or winning arguments. It's the very specific skill of having a conversation in-character (usually with an NPC), and, in the process, getting what you want. A typical example, again, is convincing the town's guard to let you in to the party (where you're not supposed to be).<br/><br/>Some people really enjoying playing this out, and take joy in it. I've seen whole campaigns where the entirety of the players' role is to follow the GM's story (which is fairly linear), decide on their characters' moves in combat (where they have total freedom), and fast-talk or persuade or cajole their way past NPCs in their way. <br/><br/>The prevalence of this playstyle, is, I think, one of the reasons so many D&amp;D players were very unhappy when skills like Diplomacy or Persuasion were added to the game: they prefer to "talk it out", and win over their opposition through rhetorical traps, fast-talking, or intimidation. *Not* doing that means they're not really roleplaying anymore, since those tense conversations were the meat of their play (aside from the combats and/or puzzles). Hence accusations of "rollplaying" and similar, thrown at games or people who roll dice for this kind of situation instead.<br/><br/>Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've seen many a D&amp;D game like this, though of course this playstyle can happen regardless of the mechanics in play (so long as they are relatively traditional; of course this wouldn't work in Dogs in the Vineyard or Universalis).<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><br/>The same goes for the players.

While this is typically the domain of the GM (who then can play "gotcha!"), there are some players who do this. Sometimes it's about fictional details or preparation, and sometimes it's about, for example, coming to the table with an incredibly effective character build, and then enjoying catching everyone off-guard when their character defeats everyone they meet because of some obscure combination of powers.<br/><br/>I only ever played in a D&amp;D3E campaign once, and tried to make a "social monster" kind of character. I wasn't sneaky about it (and it wasn't my intention to ruin anyone's fun, I was just experimenting because I'd never played the game before - this wasn't something you could do in previous editions), and all the players told me that my character wasn't going to be combat-ready enough, and asked me to make a different character because I was going to be the weak link in the party.<br/><br/>The GM was on my side, and eventually they stopped harassing me about it (especially when it turned out there was very little combat in the game, anyway). Unfortunately, after a couple of sessions, the GM informed us all that my character was ruining his plot (because he could almost always tell when NPCs were lying, and a huge part of the game was NPCs misleading us about this and that), and changed the rules, making all his abilities significantly less powerful.<br/><br/>I didn't set out to do any of the on purpose, mind you, but I've seen a lot of people do that kind of thing very intentionally. Finding loopholes in the rules, obscure sourcebooks with rare powers, that kind of thing.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>More interestingly, I used to play with a fellow who was incredibly good at this, but didn't care much about rules or powers: with him, it was all about clever planning and outsmarting the GM. (The GM was happy to play along, so it made for really fun gaming - had it become a power struggle, I'm sure it would have been a drag.)<br/><br/>He would carefully set one element after another of an intricate plan, but in such an order that his actions seemed completely nonsensical. ("Ok, once I've talked to the bank teller and handed him that note - which I have here, folded up, and I will open when someone reads it in-game - I'll take the prepaid cell phone I purchased earlier and drop it into the garbage can of the hotel across the street...") <br/><br/>We learned to trust him with his weird antics, which at first appeared to distract us from the game, because eventually he would fill in the missing piece and his plan would spring into action. ("Ok, so when the NPC gets the note from the bank teller, it's got a phone number on it, and when he dials it, it makes the cell phone in the garbage can ring. Remember earlier when I said I was recording the villain's speech about Maria Gardenias? I made that recording the ring-tone...")<br/><br/>That was a lot of fun, and I've never seen anyone do it so well before or since. I always had a feeling that this was a skill or habit he picked up from playing with GMs who would always ruin his plans if he gave them away beforehand (and therefore learned to keep them secret), but, now, with a fair and generous GM, it was a great source of entertainment for our group.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444602/#Comment_444602" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T20:40:47+00:00" title="April  6, 2015  8:40PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2015 8:42PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this conversation would get a lot clearer (though also possibly derail entirely) if any proposed skill included a list of games where the skill is particularly important. If every game qualifies for that list, probably it's not a helpful category.<br/><br/>So like 'character choices,' which was brought up in the first set of posts -- are there actually any games where character choices <i>aren't</i> important to 'thriving' play? Or does this need to be broken down further? This is already suggested in the OPs second post, where the follow up is "more interesting? more effective?" Maybe 'making interesting choices' and 'making effective choices' are two separable skills -- certainly this is the kind of divide that I can imagine informing a player's choice of game.<br/><br/>For example, someone who is good at making effective character choices is going to find that skill actively hindering their ability to play <i>Fiasco</i>, whereas someone who is good at making interesting character choices will thrive much more easily in the same game. <br/><br/>Similarly, I think many people have had the experience when playing tactically-focused games like D&amp;D or the like, where the 'interesting' choices they decided to make (either in building their character, or in the moment) simply resulted in ineffective (and therefore poor) play, from the perspective of the GM and other players. (I had this experience many, many times in Cyberpunk 2020 games, for example.)<br/><br/>So if 'making character choices' is a skill, maybe it makes more sense (in the context of the OP) to divide it into 'making interesting character choices' and 'making effective character choices' -- or even subdivide further, as there are many different ways of being interesting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444603/#Comment_444603" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T21:35:49+00:00" title="April  6, 2015  9:35PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444605/#Comment_444605" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T22:30:25+00:00" title="April  6, 2015 10:30PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't want to discourage replies by putting forth too many requirements, but I'm totally with ya, ICE.

Games that focus on problem solving tend to de-emphasize or even reject this skill; it is far more important to accurately describe precisely what is being attempted.<br/><br/><b>In-character dialogue.</b> Some games rely heavily on in-character, dialogue-driven interaction. This is particularly true of more free-form games, particularly those with a contemporary setting; but also, lots of genre-focused games are aimed at genres that are themselves dialogue-centric. This is less about things like accents and actorly emoting and more about the ability to deliver believable, character-consistent dialogue <i>that actually conveys characterization or moves the action forward</i> -- there are lots of games that might get played with lots if dialogue, but where the dialogue is not actually necessary (lots of D&amp;D groups where people enjoy in-character kibbitzing, for example) to 'thriving' gameplay. Example games: Ribbon Drive, Breaking the Ice, Fuck Youth.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
