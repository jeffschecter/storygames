I've given them both a bit of playtesting and asked some folks to review them in-person, but there're spots opening up in the ongoing game I'm a part of and I'd like to have them looked over as much as possible before they get playtested in a long-form game.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JF9GOl6VFd--hEzyGF5zYCNdBh86-pgfmQLGevg79CM/edit" rel="nofollow">The Believer</a> is all about following hunches, taking risks, and being wrong sometimes. They pursue the special things in the world in the hopes that they\u2019ll rub off. Fox Mulder and Dipper Pines are two of the big inspirations there, and there's a heavy focus on the pursuit of Obsessions at the cost of other things.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FMl8UXhUOxrVpC86nZWpBQkKvYrjoYPt-wVIUTQv2t0/edit" rel="nofollow">The Dream</a> is all about using intimacy to learn secrets and make people please you, or please yourself at their expense. They have the ability to walk in the dreams of others while they sleep (and even bring things back out with them). Originally started as a straight-up old-school succubus before it turned into something a bit more akin to a Nightmare in terms of focus.<br/><br/>(My apologies for not having them in the proper layout, but I'm terrible with inDesign, so editing is much easier for me like this at the moment since I actually understand what I'm doing.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439964/#Comment_439964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T18:56:15+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  6:56PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (this is Max)<br/>They look good! One thing I look for in Monsterhearts skins is how their premise as supernaturals/members of the supernatural community acts as a metaphor for some kind of teenage dysfunction or issue. With your Skins those metaphors don't immediately leap out at me. It shouldn't be necessary to define that in the Skin itself (as the mechanics should imply it) but it would help giving feedback if you defined what your metaphorical intention is. That is, if you have one - some Skins do just fine without one, but that too would be good to know.<br/><br/>I haven't examined the mechanics closely yet, but one thing to remember is that brevity is surprisingly important both to the players and to your design. It's one of the benefits of doing the layout work early - I plugged your Playing The [X] for both into the layout template and it shot way through the limits of the layout (about halfway through the Who They Are section of the Believer's and maybe a third of the way through Suck Face's paragraph on the Dream). I also suspect that if place in, the combined size of You Gotta Believe Me, The MacGuffin, and five other moves will be a bit much for it; if there's a way to be more concise with them it might be better.<br/>Of course, this is the impact of practicality upon design. You could always keep them in this form, or change up the standard format if you particularly wanted, but it's something to stay aware of.<br/><br/>I'll give a more thorough reading of the actual mechanics over the weekend probably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LearnedKnave" title="LearnedKnave"><img alt="LearnedKnave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LearnedKnave">LearnedKnave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439984/#Comment_439984" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T03:15:05+00:00" title="November  6, 2014  3:15AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many thanks!<br/><br/>Re: Metaphors: For the most part the skins we've been working on have skewed a bit older in their dysfunction. The Believer, for instance, is someone that chases whatever is special in the hopes of becoming special themselves. They're the conspiracy theorist and the kid with weird ideas that most people find kind of awkward to be around because of how invested they are in everything.<br/><br/>The Dream, on the other hand, is the companion to the Mortal -- someone that pries into everyone else's business and is tiring to be around for various reasons. The gossip-monger is one option, but also the kind of strange out-of-place person that lots of people have a crush on.<br/><br/>Neither of those are super specific, I know. I could name <i>people</i> better than archetypes, possibly, but certainly not outright. I've just known/know of folks that fill each role to some extent or another.<br/><br/>Re; Spacing: That's a good point that we hadn't considered maybe as much as we ought've. I know with the 'Playing' and 'Under the' sections we wanted to start by giving lots of info and then cutting down, but hadn't fully considered how long the moves were for space's sake. Might cut down on some of the flowery language/see about tightening it up a bit.<br/><br/>Re: MacGuffin: Thiiis is probably the culprit. There was temptation to give it to someone else as a primary move, but I like the fit for the Believer. Though I thiiink I'll yank it, it was good at first but as the rest of their moves get made better it feels more and more out of place. Also that way space is much less of an issue for them.<br/><br/>Thanks again for the looks-over, look forward to hearing your thoughts on the actual mechanics!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440011/#Comment_440011" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-07T10:50:36+00:00" title="November  7, 2014 10:50AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. Gonna focus on the Believer first.<br/><br/>The Believer, by definition, chases an Obsession. That's interesting because it makes the Believer a counterpart to the other obsession-chasing skin, the Ghoul; while the Ghoul chases their obsession out of need, a Believer chases it out of want. Thinking about that, there might be some cues to how the game handles the Ghoul that could help with the Believer.<br/>I think I'd be more interested in a more pointed list of potential obsessions, specific concepts to be obsessed over rather than questions, but that might be a personal taste thing. Some of the obsessions (such as numbers 6, 7, and 8) don't really strike me as being of the tone that a Monsterhearts game would pursue, especially early on. Those are things a plot might grow into, but I don't feel like they're great starting points for a game that, especially early on, demands a lot of adversity between the player characters. That's what makes all the Ghoul's hunger options great - all of them are built in a way that when a ghoul pursues them it puts everyone in a tough situation, even if they weren't targeted or directly involved. How does the pursuit of each Obsession lead to conflict between players even when the actual actions are disconnected from them? My favorite is the last one, "What do They want with me?" because paranoia of that level affects your interactions with everyone, regardless of whether they're actually connected. My least favorite is "Which one of my classmates isn't human?" because if that's not answered within two sessions at the most (assuming you're not all non-supernaturals) then your game is surprisingly cagey with the details, and needing an advancement to change after just a couple sessions is very costly.<br/>Don't be afraid of very direct or specific obsessions. Being obsessed with Demons is never good for anybody. Being obsessed with Vampires puts you in a particular niche in the high school ecosystem while simultaneously turning yourself into a danger to any actual vampire communities. Curiously, I don't think Aliens is actually a very productive obsession as there's no real avenue for players to currently be one and genuine (and even obsessive) belief in aliens is surprisingly acceptable. Obsessions create the most drama and conflict when they're dangerous or taboo to all parties - ones that make the obsessions themselves afraid, that frighten the public, and would prove dangerous (physically or emotionally as well as socially) to the believer, especially if they're attempting to use the belief to make themselves something special. I'm quite fond of Demons for this personally, but there are others. Funnily enough, Angels are great too - the super-faithful would make great Believers.<br/><br/>I think <i>Them</i> is a seriously underused and underexplained idea. It's one of the most compelling things about the Skin because it takes the Obsession and turns it directly into an opposition force instead of just a goal to work toward. All of the Obsessions seem to involve some element of a covering-up force (enough to get Them into several moves), but the concept of Them is never clearly explained as an organized secret force responsible for keeping your Obsession from coming to the public's attention. It's explained that it is operated on as individuals rather than a collective, but not what that collective actually represents in broader terms. It's also completely absent from the flavor, which will be people's first impressions of the Skin and I think it's a bit of mistake to leave out such a big concept.<br/><br/>For You Gotta Believe Me, I feel like They Take Your Side pretty easily covers some of the other responses. In general, I would assume that if they took my side they would be willing to help (give what they think you need) or converse honestly. The options leave the opportunity for them to stay skeptical but still helpful, but it kinda muddies the result. A 10+ here should be a great result seeing as the 7-9 is still pretty good (a success with complications rather than a mitigated failure). I would shift it to be like this:\n<blockquote>On a 10+, they choose to take your side or to take the condition <i>conspirator</i> to pick an option from the 7-9 list.</blockquote>\nI prefer a condition like Conspirator to Highly Suspicious. Labelling them suspicious is just a less assertive Condition, and calling them a conspirator drags the entire idea of paranoia of Them and the cover-up in explicitly, not really leaving any room for them to be labeled an independent actor in the problem.<br/>The other main question I have about You Gotta Believe Me is why you established a miss clause. Doing that's a pretty rare case in MH, and for a core move (which the Believer will probably roll at least as often as any of the Basic Moves) it deprives the MC of one of their few opportunities to assert their will by Hard Move.<br/><br/>In general, I think the thing I'm more interested in with The Believer is their paranoia of why others don't believe. Paranoia is a lot more volatile to relationships than investigation, and trust and broken trust is a really interesting paranoia-adjacent idea that I haven't really seen in an MH skin that you bring up in the Under the Skin section, in the bit about how they'll craft fragile but precious relationships. That concept in particular makes the Believer far more enticing to me than I thought at first, and it only comes out strongly after looking closely at the Skin. It might be something to aim the design spotlight at more or at least write to, as it's quite a subtle theme right now despite its importance to the concept. Or maybe I'm just personally more interested in exploring that - if you'd prefer to focus on the investigative believing side I can understand that.<br/><br/>There's one key element that I think is missing from the Believer's move toolkit: something about when they're proven wrong about something. Stuff like "you question your faith in another belief," "you double down even though you know you're wrong, " and "you deny the validity of their evidence." <br/><br/>So the Obsession is your big hook as a character, but you're penalized for revealing it to other characters (giving away a String when you do so). In order to get it more quickly involved in play, it might be helpful to explicitly reveal it to someone through the Backstory. Maybe the absolutely-trusted person. It might be implied already, but it's worth spelling it out.<br/><br/>Now it's 3AM and this is a long post already, so I'll get to the Dream soon. I'm travelling over the weekend so I don't know how soon it'll be up, but I'll be thinking about it.<br/>- Max                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LearnedKnave" title="LearnedKnave"><img alt="LearnedKnave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LearnedKnave">LearnedKnave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440018/#Comment_440018" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-08T01:56:28+00:00" title="November  8, 2014  1:56AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much obliged once more! One of the big reasons I wanted to put this up there would be to get feedback from someone that wasn't involved at all in the building process, because there's a lot of assumptions we were making about play decisions and stuff that's only hinted at that won't be obvious to someone that, uh, hasn't been here for it all.<br/><br/>Note on Obsession-changing: it's <i>with</i> an advancement, not <i>as</i> an advancement, more or less for just that reason. Before it was "at the start of each session" but that seemed a bit... dull, and kind of weird. The advancement option lets them run two Obsessions in parallel.<br/><br/>That said, very good point about the need for more pointed Obsessions that push more conflict. I'll see if we can't come up with a few that do that better and leave the easier/softer ones to people coming up with their own.<br/><br/>We definitely want to up the paranoia aspect a bit more. We didn't want <i>Them</i> to be mandatory because the additional level of conspiracy might not go well for everyone, but it might not be a bad idea. Would certainly make some things a bit easier... will definitely go add them into the flavor, at the very least. One of the big ideas was to make <i>Them</i> just one of the threats already being set up by the MC, to keep things relatively simple and not introduce a new set of Big Bads out of nowhere once the Believer or one of their moves enter play.<br/><br/>You Gotta Believe Me was rooted in a Hocus move, and maybe retained a few elements that didn't work so well. I'll change that right up, I like your suggestion a lot, and it saves on space!<br/><br/>Definitely going to tweak the backstory to be revealed, because yeah, that's meant to be the case already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LearnedKnave" title="LearnedKnave"><img alt="LearnedKnave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LearnedKnave">LearnedKnave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440021/#Comment_440021" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-08T07:18:24+00:00" title="November  8, 2014  7:18AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Changes made!

Dunno if they'll quite do the trick, but... playtesting and all that.<br/><br/>Also did some changes with Obsessions and tweaked some of the move wordings to better convey the flavor we were hoping for (Always Watching in particular).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
