For instance, is there a character who has just been wounded, or is in the hospital, or the subject of some dangerous magics? How about they wake up/recover, but have no memory of what came before? Or maybe even different memories altogether, which don't match up with what's going on.<br/><br/>Or maybe we find out that someone is actually possessed, and when the demon is chased out, the person who remains is this new character.<br/><br/>If the characters have just encountered some kind of "outside" force or faction--a different nation, a new species, an underground guild they were unaware of previously, a new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, an exchange student--then this is a good opportunity to bring in the new player, and give them total say over what this new faction represents, where they're from, and why they're here.<br/><br/>Another approach I've seen work is to take a relatively minor character we don't know much about and develop them into a PC. A kid at the back of the class, who's seen fairly little screen time up until now. One of the characters' father. I once joined an ongoing campaign and it was explained to me that I would be playing the part of a thief/burglar that the PCs had apprehended while he was trying to break into their home. I had total leeway to decide who the character was, and why he was there, as well as a reason why they might be interested in cooperating, so this worked really well.<br/><br/>In a D&amp;D dungeon crawl-type situation, playing a recent captive (or local "guide") could be a fun role, I think, if the new player likes the idea.<br/><br/>I think it's also fine (if the player is into it) to include a new player in a specific role. "Ok, they've been dealing with this Duke, who's encroaching on the local Lord's territory with an army. I put him into the game in order to put pressure on their relationship with the Lord. Would you like to play him?" If the player isn't sure what to do, they can go along with that NPC's current 'purpose' in the story, and feel like they immediately have an "in" to the story and in-game goals. If they develop their own ideas along the way, even better: who's to say the Duke didn't have different plans all along?<br/><br/>In any case, I think it's important to give some room to the game to breathe, and not to be afraid to change details or reinterpret backstory so that the game makes sense <i>for the people playing</i>, even if it means some gaps in continuity. That's the main thing I'd keep my eye on. You don't want the new player to feel like they're walking on eggshells, no matter what.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408957/#Comment_408957" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T16:54:07+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  4:54PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2013 4:54PM by Mathalus.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Let the character be someone the PCs know who is perhaps new to whatever kind of situation the players are in.

I feel like the setting, the roles of the PCs, and the type of game work together to imply some solutions over others. When I introduced new people to a multi-year In Nomine storyline, for instance, I leaned heavily on certain premises of the setting to incorporate newbies: When everybody is working under orders from someone way more powerful than themselves, they have no choice but to show "the new guy" the ropes. This also meant discouraging certain PC concepts, though: You don't want to encourage a new player to take on the role of "the seasoned veteran" in an unfamiliar setting, with unfamiliar rules, knowing they're going to feel like they're constantly falling short of what they envision for the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409113/#Comment_409113" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T09:31:27+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  9:31AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be tempted to steal the Emotion Matrix (see the first link <a href="http://tenra-rpg.com/support.shtml" rel="nofollow">on this page</a>) from <i>Tenra Bansho Zero</i>.
