It was kick-ass. I'll replicate the "explanatory notes" from the link above so you'll know if it's up your alley.<br/><br/>Two or more million years in the future, humanity has evolved into two or more separate species. The two we are familiar with are Graciles and Robusts.<br/><br/>Robusts left Earth a few million years ago in colony ships at near-light speeds and landed on an alien planet that was thought to be capable of supporting human life. There, they encountered a monoculture they came to call The Dirt. The Dirt is a number of sapient microorganism cultures that exist in the topsoil. They worked their way into Robust biology and co-evolved with them. The Robusts are excellent biotechnologists, and it may be that The Dirt used their skills to achieve biodiversity in its home ecology.<br/><br/>Robusts are short, squat, and powerfully-muscled. Their bones and jaws are thick and powerful. They are shorter-lived than humans of today, become young adults at the age of ten, and are individually not that "bright," but become exponentially more "intelligent" the more people are working on a problem. They are jovially violent with one another. They consume The Dirt in order to perceive directly the experiences of other living Robusts, as well as their ancestors. They often resurrect the dead, complete with the neuron connections and potentials that were present when the body is buried in The Dirt.<br/><br/>Graciles remained on and around Earth when the other colony ships left. They consider themselves to be baseline humans, though of course evolution worked as much on them as it has on any other form of humanity. They recently developed the ability to use wormholes to skip over light-centuries of space travel, and have begun to use this technology to try to reconnect with their lost brethren. The wormhole technology is initially one-way and must be located outside of a solar system. Until there is two-way capability, travel is exceedingly dangerous, with failure rates and travel times akin to cross-Atlantic voyages in the Age of Exploration.<br/><br/>The Graciles are tall, thin, and delicate-boned. Graciles are very long-lived, reaching adolescence in their twenties and frequently living several-hundred years. They have prehensile toes and are masters of the strength-to-mass ratio. Thus much of their architecture and technology is similarly delicate-seeming, though exceedingly strong. They are well-adapted to low- and micro-gravity environments (and extraordinarily poorly-adapted to the greater-than-Earth gravity of the Robust homeworld). Their bloodstreams are awash in nanotechnology which keeps them healthy and generates the Consciousness Web. The Web is an always-on connection which can be voluntarily left for short periods, and packages and processes extreme amounts of data.<br/><br/>The initial Gracile mission consists of about a hundred scientists operating from a space elevator, the orbital portion of which is called Platform Zero. Each member is an expert in several fields and the culture they have constructed is rather like a highly-disorganized symposium.<br/><br/>This oracle was generated by, at the end of every session, generating two more oracle entries per each of the four players, then drawing one oracle entry each.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199944/#Comment_199944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T10:31:29+00:00" title="April  1, 2009 10:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2009 10:31AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS: Does anyone know how to prevent Abulafia from giving repeat entries?

She got kind of defensive at first, but then was, like, "Oh, yeah. That's neat stuff to address." I'd love to play this game with her sometime.</p>\n<p>The fundamentals of the game were the de-trivialization of the stuff that's supposedly mind-blowing in Star Trek, but isn't.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Space travel takes a long time. It's hard on your body.</li>\n<li>Getting to and from a planet's surface takes time and energy.</li>\n<li>Learning languages is interesting and hard.</li>\n<li>Learning cultures is interesting and hard.</li>\n<li>Adult humans have sex with each other <em>all the time</em>. It's often with someone the society frowns on them having sex with and then they have to deal with having everyone scowl at them <em>even when the scowlers are doing the same stuff.</em></li>\n<li>A highly advanced, high-tech society is still affected by a low-tech society. All cultural exchanges are two-way.</li>\n<li>Military might in the quest for truth is highly suspect.</li>\n<li>Colonial metaphors are ass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were some aesthetic principles at play, too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Graciles had dark skin and tight, curly hair that they braided to keep under control in 0G.</li>\n<li>Technologies don't glow. Physical displays look like ink on paper.</li>\n<li>"Whiteness" is not an indicator of "Modernity". The Graciles' clothes are grey and brown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See, I have a problem with the Space Honkies aspect of Star Trek. I have a problem with a lot of the premises in it, in fact. Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO58SGiYwwo" rel="nofollow">a 60s era Philco-Ford promotional movie</a>, it posits all sorts of technological leaps that make our lives <em>better</em> without making our lives <em>different</em>.</p>\n<p>I think we did a pretty good job of addressing that stuff. We had some systematic challenges and I think it needs a written system that better suits the environment. Perhaps one that changes when the values of the society change.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200961/#Comment_200961" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T13:36:38+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  1:36PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just released a podcast episode about this game.
