Mainly because it's easy to learn, and works just as well for someone who likes tactical crunch like GURPS or D&amp;D as someone who just wants to tell a story and do method acting and gets incredibly bored with anything to do with numbers. Wide appeal and doing it well being the key point.<br/><br/>Then I saw this; <a href="http://rpg.brouhaha.us/?p=3926&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GamingBrouhahaRpg+%28Gaming+Brouhaha+%C2%BB+RPG%29" rel="nofollow">FATE Power Cards</a> and there seems to be the same thing going on - a (potential) wide range of appeal, while doing it well. <br/><br/>That's an interesting thought to me, because there's this notion that seems to go with buying new RPGs - that I'll eventually find one that I'll like and someone else will like too - of finding a holy grail game that works well for everyone. Maybe it's a pipe dream, but it's worth exploring nonetheless.<br/><br/>I also think about the OSR, and pretty much the first thing that comes up - rolling stats. It seems to me that the entire problem with the system is that element. Take it out and replace it with something better and it's pretty tolerable. I figure for me the issue is that with things like racial class and level restrictions, at least the constraints are fixed and I can work within them, but bad rolls to start with can bone me no matter how hard I plan, and good rolls can benefit me far better than any planning could. On the flip side, there may be another (hypothetical?) person who's content to let his characters die until he rolls one up that has solid scores and settles for that. Rather than planning it's laziness and patience, and the reward comes as well. <br/><br/>The thing we have there again is a system that offers elements which appeal to quite different people, and overall leave them happy.<br/><br/>So what about this thought; of a system that you could pitch to almost anyone and have them say they'll play it, and they'll actually enjoy for the system and not the company. Possible? Desirable? Does anyone think it exists?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305646/#Comment_305646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T00:02:52+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 12:02AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say not possible.

I suppose I'm just shooting down your idea, Robin, but aside from little nuggets in games like Storming the Wizard's Tower (the People lists don't have much to do with everything else, mechanically, but they can be a draw for story-focused players), I haven't encountered much in any RPG that serves as a useful, well-done example of appealing to "different tastes". <br/><br/>It may be an impossible grail.

I remember listening to a podcast of an interview with Dave Weseley and noting something that he said: Back in the very early days of D&amp;D and the games that immediately preceded D&amp;D, his group would run into players who just didn't get the playstyle. <br/><br/>So they didn't play with those games with those players, and everything turned out better for it.<br/><br/>On a side note, having looked somewhat and thought somewhat about the very early context those stat rolling rules were created for, I've come to very different conclusions about their Good Thing/Bad thing qualities. I won't derail this thread further, but I will note for now that the random stat thing makes much more sense in the earliest ersions of what would become D&amp;D. It seems like, since they made sense for the designers in the original context, they were simply retained for a long time, even when thew game play style/gamer culture had gone through some pretty major shifts in expectation. ( That shift apparently didn't take very long, either, like a year or three at most)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305684/#Comment_305684" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T07:50:15+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  7:50AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>so it's not that some games have too much crunch for narrative focused players, it's that it's presented so poorly that it's not worth a narrative player's time investment.</blockquote>\nAs someone who's really, really focused on narrative in games (as in, making player-authored choices, thematic decisions, etc.), I can say that it all depends on what the crunch is FOR.<br/>You seem to be driving at one of two things: <br/>1- "I, the Narrativist player, would like this tactical game a lot more if it were better explained!" Possible. Depends on whether such a player *also* enjoys tactical play. <br/>2- "I, the Narrativist player, would enjoy this very complicated narrative game design if it were better explained!" Extremely likely - games like Spirit of the Century and Burning Wheel are complicated enough that a lot of hand-holding would mean players are better-informed about what's going on in the game, and thus better able to a) give it a go and b) decide if it sounds interesting.<br/>Oh, and the phrase "Narrativist player" here just means someone who prefers that sort of play above others.<br/><br/>So, Tyler - which one did you mean? I really do think that strategic/tactical games and dramatic/emotive games tend not to have a lot of common ground. It's not impossible to cover both, of course, but it's tricky, especially if mechanics for, say, social combat and for firefights start diverging - there may be a tactical element to escalating a conflict in Dogs in the Vineyard, but the tactical thinking ultimately serves the emotional/dramatic tastes of the player, rather than serving to create conflicts that are tactically complex.<br/>ALL games have some hint of tactical or strategic thinking to them; that's how their economies and reward cycles function. But obviously some games make the strategery a part of both "using the rules" and of "what happens in play".<br/><br/>Anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305717/#Comment_305717" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T10:35:02+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 10:35AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I mean, even with things that come close to being universally liked, someone's going to be unhappy</blockquote>\nThere are plenty of people who are willing to play D&amp;D simply because it's what's out there to play. Obviously some people still refuse to play it, so I'm thinking that if something is more generally palatable the rest would be covered (hypothetically) by its popularity and a simple desire to have some social interaction. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Why do you want to create such a game? This is an honest question, not a rhetorical one.<br/></blockquote>\nBased on part of it being based on popularity, I think realistically we're waiting for Wizards to come up with something that's more universally liked (or White Wolf?), so I'm more exploring the idea at this point than even considering such an undertaking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>In such a situation, I'm inclined to think it more useful and important to find some other sort of common ground than to wrack one's brain for a design that accommodates multiple, divergent tastes.</blockquote>\nActually, at this point I'm just waiting for Arc Dream to send me the M&amp;oCT/Bigger Bads that I ordered 10 months ago, as that covers my main group very well, but it also happens to work so well because they all went to high-school together. It wouldn't necessarily work out so well for others. I think the appeal for me with a system that has "universal" appeal is if you want to introduce someone to RPGs, it's nice to have a go-to system that has a great first impression.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>i think by simply being books rpgs are limiting their reach. component presentations reach a wider audience simply because they work with more styles of learning, it's like close-captioning or multiple language tracks, that feature directly allows more people to view a DVD.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThis is a good point. There's a certain limiting factor in a game that requires a good understanding of the rules. I can cover with AD&amp;D because I know the rules so well, but any other system that's similar would take me years (or maybe months for BRP or other d% systems), so for people who don't want to spend time reading an instruction manual the presentation is a major barrier to entry. Marketing too I suppose, since I didn't meet many people who actually started with AD&amp;D First Quest, although I know a few people who got it after already playing RPGs.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>Proper presentation is all it takes to please <b>more</b> people.</blockquote>\nBroadening appeal would be a great first step. More people is also likely much more realistic than everyone.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>I am quite firmly on the side saying "not possible".

I really do think that strategic/tactical games and dramatic/emotive games tend not to have a lot of common ground. It's not impossible to cover both, of course, but it's tricky, especially if mechanics for, say, social combat and for firefights start diverging - there may be a tactical element to escalating a conflict in Dogs in the Vineyard, but the tactical thinking ultimately serves the emotional/dramatic tastes of the player, rather than serving to create conflicts that are tactically complex.<br/>ALL games have some hint of tactical or strategic thinking to them; that's how their economies and reward cycles function. But obviously some games make the strategery a part of both "using the rules" and of "what happens in play".<br/><br/>Anyway.<br/><br/>as for 1. I think a Narrativist player is more likely to put up with BS if it takes less time to learn and resolve. games that need to attract more then one player are sometimes a compromise like this.<br/><br/>as for 2. As I have said in other places you can design winning strategies into a game that actually increase the quality of the narrative. strategy can be a lovely set of rules that you can learn at your own pace and can sometimes chose to ignore if you really want to. <br/><br/>the key point is that regardless the flavor of the rules, they can do nothing if stuck in a book.<br/><br/>i think of "crunch" and "Narrative" not as opposing sides but like peanut butter and chocolate, sure their different but they can taste so good together                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305785/#Comment_305785" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T14:57:17+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  2:57PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2010 3:00PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>i think of "crunch" and "Narrative" not as opposing sides but like peanut butter and chocolate, sure their different but they can taste so good together</blockquote>Right! I wasn't trying to set them up as opposed - I was trying to find out if you were doing that. Cool, good to know. <br/>Also, I think it makes total sense to embed certain in-game strategies or tactics beside the mechanics in order to better capture how a particular genre or a type of narrative "should" function - Sorcerer and Sword considers thrown daggers to be incredibly deadly because that was Ron's under standing of the sword &amp; sorcery genre. <br/><br/>One question though, because this sort of discussion really hinges on sharing common definitions of words: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>a Narrativist player is more likely to put up with <b>BS</b> if it takes less time to learn and resolve.</blockquote> What do you mean by BS, here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305786/#Comment_305786" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T15:07:32+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  3:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2010 3:09PM by TylerT.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BS would be anything that particular player defines as something they are not interested in. so BS is different for all players. you know one mans trash is another man's treasure.<br/><br/>to me BS is item descriptions, but to someone else it's vital to their mental image and a great reward for playing. luckily when descriptive text is formatted properly i can avoid it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305798/#Comment_305798" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T16:07:06+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  4:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler, I think this definition you've posed gets to the heart of what you're actually proposing in this thread - what you mean by "tastes", etc. <br/>I assumed you were talking more along the lines of something major and singular, like what Creative Agenda the rules support.<br/>Sooo<br/>I think the design goal you're setting forth is both more and less achievable, as a result - it is no longer theoretically difficult to achieve (as in, it does not go against the play experience of Forge theorists), but it's probably a much more complicated issue now - while CA is sort of a vanilla/chocolate/strawberry situation (with a "like/dislike" indicator for individual games that share a main flavor), designating different solutions to design problems as a matter of taste leaves us with the very high bar indeed of tailoring a design for people with very specific tastes.<br/>It's theoretically achievable, but probably not too easy to pull off and possibly rather narrow in application. <br/><br/>You mentioned disliking random stat rolls - you base this distaste on how you feel like it messes with your strategy by being too heavily weighted as a random element. That's valid. I know for folks like me, and probably Gregor, it would feel "off" to play an RPG about classic dungeon-crawling and NOT roll stats - some of us read the stat-roll mechanic as part of the game's challenge, something to buy into as part of the whole package of 0e D&amp;D. <br/>But that aside, what elements do you like?

It's roughly the same as saying the character has a single luck stat and rolling 1d100 for it and every other task in the game is a percentile roll under check for luck. What I do like is having finite resources to work with, constraints under which to work and finding a way to get good results. Pairing certain races &amp; classes together is an example of that.<br/><br/>Having a slightly different implementation of random rolling I'm fine with though (Reign for instance), and if the choices are too obvious it gets boring (Halfling Thief, Elf Fighter/Mage, Dwarf Fighter, Gnome Illusionist/Thief - might as well just go back to race as class and not pretend that there is strategy in there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305880/#Comment_305880" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T14:26:54+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  2:26PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few thoughts going all the way back to the beginning of the thread:<br/><br/>First, in any group endeavor, especially artistic endeavors, you are not going to get everything you want, period. You can't even get four friends to have a favorite restaurant, why would anyone in the history of mankind think that you can always get all of your tastes fully satisfied in a group working together on something as extensive and varied as your typical roleplaying campaign? Nobody thinks that who has thought about it for five seconds.<br/><br/>So the question becomes what are you willing to give up?  Take the dislike of stat-rolling in OSR-style games. Maybe you don't like it. Okay, but will you do it in return for something else that game does really well that you do like?  Will you do it in return for playing with this group that you do enjoy?  Will you do it if you only have to do it once or twice in a game campaign? This is the nature of compromise, this is the nature of all shared enterprises, right down to what you want on your pizza.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305957/#Comment_305957" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T07:01:28+00:00" title="December 26, 2010  7:01AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think looking at system is the wrong approach.  It's not the system that makes or breaks the game, it's how it's applied.  <br/><br/>What I want in a game is characters in conflict, making tough, meaningful choices.  You can do that in GURPS, you can do that in Storyteller, you can do that in Nobilis.  I am minimally interested in winning by proxy when my character thumps the bad guys.  You can do that in GURPS, you can do that in Storyteller, you can do that in Nobilis.  <br/><br/>Now, some systems are going to be better suited to some creative agendas than others, but this really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone on this board.  <br/><br/>By comparison, something like stat rolling is not even on my radar.  If you have stats, you have to determine them somehow, and rolling works as well as anything else.  If I have to roll stats to get meaningful, difficult choices, I'll roll stats without a second thought. <br/><br/>And while you can't get *everything* you want, it's certainly possible to get *most* of what you want.  My friends don't all share a favorite restaurant, but I can easily find four whose top five restaurants have significant overlap with my top five; also, I have some friends I know to call when I feel like rodizio, and some friends I know to call when I feel like Neapolitan.  The notions that friends always do everything together, and that not inviting someone who will not enjoy what you propose to do is a sort of ostracision, are geek social fallacies: if I limited myself to only the restaurants that *all* my friends enjoy, much as you propose to do with your universal game, it would be a pretty miserable experience going there every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306015/#Comment_306015" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T02:04:42+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  2:04AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think of it more differently, it's not about once you've already got the friends. Think about meeting someone new, and deciding which restaurant to take them to. It's always nice to have a great fallback plan. For me it's a restaurant called The Rogue. It's reasonably upscale without being excessively expensive, the food's priced well, service is great and it tastes good. There's also this thing where if you feel the food was worth less than the menu price, you pay that price. If you think it's worth more, you can pay more and the extra goes to charity. So there nobody has to worry about having the meal be too expensive for them, while at the same time someone who's used to eating at more expensive restaurants doesn't feel they're taking a step down due to the ambiance, quality of service and the food.<br/><br/>It's a nice restaurant to have as a fallback, that'll guaranteed leave a good impression. It'd be nice to have an RPG like that too, where if you want to introduce someone to a game and don't want to spend half an hour picking their brain to figure out what it is they really like, and in doing so make them decide that it's just not worth the trouble, you just decide the game, show it to them, and you can be reasonably certain that they'll have fun with it and find something they like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306019/#Comment_306019" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T03:04:20+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  3:04AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ambient, service, prices, quality is all great.

Age, Players and time are these qualities condensed to their most basic if a little abstract. <br/><br/>But before I can even buy an rpg i'm like "hey dudes who wants to play this game where your like mice and do crap" and they are all like "mice, maybe" and i'm like " shut up and read this comic" and they are like "ok".<br/><br/>And then after that i have to get a frigging book, read it, come up with a story and then answer questions like "can I have purple daggers"<br/><br/>Edit to add "A POINT"<br/><br/>so before we start talking about what choices or compromises we have to make to apeal to people. I think rpgs could do a much better overall job of structuring themselves into something that resembles a game that people can play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306024/#Comment_306024" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T05:36:17+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  5:36AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2010 5:37AM by Teataine.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler: Excellent!<br/><br/>I've been meaning to write a lenghty rant about how we need a new set of categories/labels whatever to sort RPGs by. It would also be useful to dispell all these silly "rpg vs not rpg" arguments imo. Frex Settlers of Cattan, Jungle Speed and Parcheesi are all boardgames. They couldn't be more different, but nobody has a beef with calling them boardgames.<br/><br/>But with RPGs we hit this brick wall where people start discussing whether Fiasco, WHFRP3 and D&amp;D are actually the same kind of game or not. Age, players and time is an excellent point to start from, but how about other categories such as:<br/>-"GM-full/GM-less", <br/>-"Genre" "Setting" etc.<br/>- skills that the game promotes: "Tacticall Skills, Strategic Thinking, Improvisation..." etc. <br/>-Co-op? Competitive? Freeform?<br/>-categories: Adventure, Exploration, Economy, Negotiation...<br/>-techiques &amp; mechanics: bidding, dice rolls, card draws, roll &amp; move, scripting...<br/>-language dependency, length of text/manual, level of complexity, quantity of rules...<br/><br/>Boardgame geek does this and while it makes matters more complex and multi-layered I think it's an excellent way to describe games. But people are lazy. It's easier to call WHFRP3 "not a RPG" because it has cards and tokens. Sigh.<br/><br/>So: yes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306082/#Comment_306082" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T16:19:11+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  4:19PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how would we go about categorising RPGs like that?

The only way to figure out what a game is like before buying it now is to read review and actual play reports, which can often be incomplete, subjective etc. Why not stick a bunch of this info right on the book or box. Like a game statblock. It would be easier to figure out what tastes it caters to, what it includes, how it's supposed to play etc. <br/><br/>I don't know. That's just my opinion. <br/><br/>If I had the skills I would build something like Last.fm or Pandora for games. Games would have tags in two or three categories and could be sorted either by these tags or popularity or "relatedness" to other games. Then if you said you liked games with dice pools and D&amp;D, you'd get a suggestion for Storming the Wizard's tower or whatever.<br/><br/><br/>Also: An interesting thing Graham is doing with his Cthulhu Dark project is "globules". You've got a very light and basic core system that could fit on half a page or something, maybe a page.
