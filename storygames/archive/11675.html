"Build up several resources, but earn victory points based only on the lowest of those resources." This forces you to pursue several angles of victory all at once, leveling the playing field up until the very last turn. For example, resources might be:<br/><br/>Bricks - 6<br/>Wool - 7<br/>Lumber - 3<br/>Ore - 10<br/>Wheat - 5<br/>Water - 4<br/><br/>Good job on gathering ore! However, because your lowest resource, Lumber, is at 3, you only get 3 Victory Points. So that's the first thing I'm thinking about.<br/><br/>More recently, I've been intrigued by the new Doctor Who RPG's usage of six simple outcomes for each die roll. These are answers to the question "Did you succeed at what you were trying to do?" The six possible answers are:<br/><br/>'Yes, And...,'<br/>'Yes,'<br/>'Yes, But...,'<br/>'No, But...,'<br/>'No,'<br/>'No, And....'<br/><br/>So I had this half-assed idea of treating each of those outcomes like a Knizia resource. Every time you roll one of those outcomes, you add a tick to a meter next to it. You could potentially make an Experience Point system based on this concept. At the end of each session, you earn XP based on the lowest of those outcomes.<br/><br/>'Yes, And...,' - 4<br/>'Yes,' - 2<br/>'Yes, But...,' - 1<br/>'No, But...,' - 2<br/>'No,' - 3<br/>'No, And....' - 4<br/><br/>So you'd only get 1 XP at the end of this session. Harsh.<br/><br/>First, that's a lot of rolling only to get 1 XP. 16 rolls! Perhaps there should simply be fewer possible outcomes.<br/><br/>'Yes, And...,' - 4<br/>'Yes, But...,' - 1<br/>'No, But...,' - 2<br/>'No, And....' - 4<br/><br/>There, that's a little better. Still, that one XP better be very, very powerful or there should be an alternative way to build up each outcome/resource than pure fortune. Perhaps making this a trading game? Perhaps on your turn you may either ROLL or TRADE.<br/><br/>ROLL: Rolling works as described above. You roll the dice, get that story-outcome and add to that outcome's tally.<br/><br/>TRADE: Instead of rolling to discover the outcome, you can trade one of your resources with another player's. Then your outcome would be whatever that player just gave you. Meanwhile, his tallies would be a little more evenly split. Let's say Adam and Beth have the following tallies.\n<blockquote>ADAM<br/>'Yes, And...,' - 4<br/>'Yes, But...,' - 1<br/>'No, But...,' - 2<br/>'No, And....' - 4<br/><br/>BETH<br/>'Yes, And...,' - 3<br/>'Yes, But...,' - 3<br/>'No, But...,' - 1<br/>'No, And....' - 0<br/><br/>It's Beth's turn. She's had very lucky rolls so far, getting lots of Yes's. However, that means her lowest tally remains at zero, so she won't get any XP at the end of this session unless that is raised soon. She offers a TRADE with Adam.<br/><br/>Beth: I need some "No, And..." results soon before the session ends. You have very few "Yes, But..." and I have plenty. I'd trade you one of my "Yes, But..." for one of your "Yes, And..."<br/><br/>Adam: Sounds good to me. Let's trade.</blockquote>\nSo, yes, Beth actually <i>wants</i> to get a "No" this turn, and she gets it thanks to trading with Adam. That will still count towards her XP at the end of the session, as if she had rolled that outcome with dice.<br/><br/>So that's the little idea. I don't know what sort of emergent story comes out of that, besides a story in which the characters are note wholly successes or failures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Addendum:<br/><br/>Theoretically, you could make a game like this with FUDGE dice. Just keep track of each +, - or 0 you roll, then trade with other players to even out your tallies over time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260454/#Comment_260454" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T11:14:48+00:00" title="March  6, 2010 11:14AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very interesting. I like the idea of enforcing a particular mixture of failure and success. That way, someone who is playing to their strengths all the time and winning constantly doesn't advance quite as fast as someone who flubs more often. <br/><br/>I do see a problem here: the person who makes a bad character, or who can't make successful rolls. Their failures far outstrip their successes, and they don't get enough XP to bump up their abilities sufficiently to offset this.  They will become doubly reliant on their competent associates, first because they are the ones who are advancing the story, and second because they'll have to agree (deign?) to hand over some of their successes to the lame character.  Worse, if everyone is more or less at the same level of competence/system mastery, there won't be any reason to trade, because everyone will have the same outcome.<br/><br/>Cool idea, though..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260471/#Comment_260471" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T14:16:09+00:00" title="March  6, 2010  2:16PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think it has potential for a particular genre?

Exactly the same idea, but people had a much easier time grasping it. You just put the resources in multicolored piles of 4 as you get them, and then count the piles.<br/><br/>As far as using something like this in a roleplaying game... The thing I'd be most wary of is that unlike a board game, the time boundaries of a roleplaying game, and the number of rolls you make, are much more fluid. Having a system like this could easily lead to a crunch near the end of the session, as people start trying to get extra rolls in quickly so that their other 14 badly-distributed rolls don't all vanish. You might instead want to make this a continuous thing. The character keeps track of their rolls over all time, and every time they get a set of six they can immediately cash them in for an XP. Or two sets of six, possibly. Everything else carries over to the next session automatically. If you did this, and if you were playing a campaign of moderate length, then the law of averages should work itself out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260478/#Comment_260478" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T15:00:27+00:00" title="March  6, 2010  3:00PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2010 3:05PM by DanielSolis.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balthazar</cite>"you get one point for each complete set"</blockquote>\nThat is brilliant.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balthazar</cite>keeps track of their rolls over all time, and every time they get a set of six they can immediately cash them in for an XP.</blockquote>\nThat is also brilliant.

It could be useful for a game in which each session is intended to have escalating action.  As the clock for the session runs down, players roll more to try and balance out their points, so characters do more.  Maybe a high-energy espionage game?  I'm thinking something twisty, like James Bond movies, or 24.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260561/#Comment_260561" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T09:28:37+00:00" title="March  7, 2010  9:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another way to average the rolls out might be to not only award XP for the lowest number but to allow the player to hold on to their largest number into the next game. This would allow players to build up a stock in one resource over the course of multiple games that they can then trade. Starts the trading earlier in the game and also allows a player to become known as a distributer of that resourse.

Whoops, looks like heroic fantasy or superheroes to me. My bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might suit another game type I've been dreaming of, where each player sets the playing field for the others; imagine something like ET. You could have one player as the stranded innocent traveller, willing to deal with anyone who will get him home safely; the kids who want to protect the alien and have fun with him; and the military who see him as a threat and want to capture him for study. Each faction has an agenda that relates to the other two and their actions could determine what challenges the others face; so, the ET character would have an incentive, as a player, to be captured by the military, beacuse even though it goes against his character's best interests, it earns him a failure result he needs to complete his set.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't you hate when a better idea occurs to you after you've left the keyboard? After quickly jotting down the above, I realised that you could just about do away with two things in it; first, the GM, and second, die rolling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all conflicts are between PCs, instead of PC vs. GM, then everyone taking part has a real stake in the outcome; each participant is invested in getting an outcome in order to put it towards another complete set, almost regardless of whether they succeed or fail. I guess that's what I was trying to get at with my dream-idea, but hadn't quite applied it properly to the Doctor Who-style outcomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why trade past results when you can negotiate the current one? Players would have the option not to roll dice if they wanted to reach an agreement on how the conflict should play out; the dice ould only be rolled where the players didn't want to negotiate. Frex:<br/>\n<i>General:</i> I want to capture the alien, but not only that, I want him to tell me how to contact his people, so I'm looking for a 'Yes, and' result here.<br/>\n<i>ET:</i> Well, being being captured is ok, I need some more 'No' results, so I'll take a 'No, but', the 'but' being that I manage to leave a secret message for my friends telling them where I've been taken to.<br/>\n<i>The players agree on this outcome, so no dice are rolled and they each narrate their part of the outcome.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260654/#Comment_260654" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T07:42:40+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  7:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is exactly the notion that I've got in my head in the past couple days.
