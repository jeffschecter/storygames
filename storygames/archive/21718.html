The kickstarter is in its last 48 hours and just funded.  I was surprised not to see mention of it here on story-games so I thought I'd add this in case people are interested in jumping on.<br/><br/> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/herogames/champions-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/herogames/champions-now</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475057/#Comment_475057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-28T04:58:15+00:00" title="June 28, 2018  4:58AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting project, that. Glad to see it's found its funding. I particularly like how countercultural that whole project is in terms of the Official Imprimatur so often emphasized in rpg culture: it doesn't particularly seem to bother Ron &amp; the team that they're not creating the next official edition of the game here, but rather just putting down one self-consistent vision about what it can be. This is significantly more interesting than a 7th edition (or is that already a thing?) of the Hero System would be, with all that implies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
