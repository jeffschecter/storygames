I find them the most promising seeds for developing a story. And I love that they <i>force</i> the PC to make a choice with consequences, thus challenging them to choose what the character really believes in.<br/><br/>The obvious example would be for example the super-hero who can either save his girl-friend or a bus full of school-children.<br/><br/>Here are some things I ideas that come to my mind:<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General categories</span><br/>   - Protect family/stay home  VS  save world/go on mission<br/>   - Corruption (money/safety)  VS  integrity (risk/threat)<br/>   - Idealism (do the right thing, be yourself)  VS pragmatism (get rich, benefit)<br/>   - Uncomfortable truth  VS  comforting (tormenting?) lie<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Job offers</span><br/>   - Accept new job &amp; relocate   vs  stay with partner/family<br/>   - idealistic dream job  vs  boring job with great pay<br/>   - Tempting job offer with some shady/grey areas<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relationship</span> <br/> - Sexy affair or loyal to wife?<br/>   - Admit to partner infidelity or lie<br/>   - Enter opportunistic relationship (for money, influence, position...) without love<br/>   - Cancel romantic holiday for important business trip<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terrible secret</span><br/>   - Do you really want to know the terrible truth? (ignorance is bliss)<br/>   - Your best friend/family member has committed a crime. Do go to the police?<br/>   - Do you endure torture to keep a secret (and friends/family/allies safe)?<br/>   - Do you sell a secret for the right price?<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Things we do for power</span><br/>   - Are you willing to kill someone?<br/>   - Are you willing to betray your family/friends/allies?<br/>   - Are you willing to loose face in public?<br/>   - Are you willing to change (physical or sanity) forever?<br/><br/>See also on <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDilemma" rel="nofollow">TV Tropes (moral dilemma)</a>:<br/>- Sadistic Choice: Having to choose between two immoral actions.<br/>- If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him: Having to choose between killing a villain or sparing him.<br/>- To Be Lawful or Good: Having to choose between the law and personal morals.<br/>- Friend or Idol Decision: Having to choose between someone you care about and your mission.<br/>- Genocide Dilemma: Having to choose between destroying the evil enemy race or letting them wreak havoc. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage" title="CreativeMage"><img alt="CreativeMage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/212/nJRPAL1YGL0U7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage">CreativeMage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449916/#Comment_449916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-06T15:56:51+00:00" title="December  6, 2015  3:56PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I poked around with a similar list once.

Morals, of course, are informed by culture, so for what I was working on it was important to consider dilemmas that could be caused by the dictates of the fictional culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449918/#Comment_449918" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-07T06:07:22+00:00" title="December  7, 2015  6:07AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're restricting yourself if you see these as pairs that go together. Almost any of these can be paired up in dilemmas:<br/><br/>Corruption vs. losing face<br/>Following the law vs. important business trip<br/><br/>Etc. Basically, take any two things the character cares about and find a way to force them to choose between them. Or take two things they really don't want to happen. As an aid to finding things most peaople care about (besides the things written on their sheet or established in the fiction), I find that the five spheres of morality offer a good guide: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=print</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449921/#Comment_449921" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-07T12:35:22+00:00" title="December  7, 2015 12:35PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might also look at perceived cultural binaries like peace vs. freedom or justice vs. prosperity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449923/#Comment_449923" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-07T16:03:53+00:00" title="December  7, 2015  4:03PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2015 4:04PM by BeePeeGee.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you guys for the input.<br/><br/>Simon: I really like the NY Times text with the "five spheres of morality": <i>harm, fairness, community (or group loyalty), authority and purity </i>.<br/><br/>I also remembered the <b>Hillfolk (DramaSystem)</b> <i>Dramatic Poles</i>.

Or are you looking for a list because you need it for some kind of game design goal?<br/><br/>I ask because I would approach each differently.  For the purposes of running a game I would crib off something like a personality test for a character.  Let the players tell you what's important. Then put those things at odds.<br/><br/>For design purposes however, I think it's a bit trickier.  I quite like the list you already have, but I've been wracking my brain thinking, "there's gotta be a better way than listing it all out." What you need is a dilemma engine.<br/><br/>OK so here's me going out on a big limb trying to give an answer that encapsulates both intents...<br/>What do we as people care about? Nouns!  We care about people (some, probably not all). We care about things (from iPads to the more abstract; more later). And we care about places (where you met your SO, where you went to karate class, the city/town/house you love).  Last, but not least, we need to take a look at 'things' more closely.  I think it would be worth it to split the category across the material and abstract. The latter covers stuff like philosophies, beliefs, personal codes of honor etc. So, why sketch out the obvious?<br/><br/>I present to you NiC- Nouns in Conflict:<br/><br/>Noun 1 is in Conflict with Noun 2 because of Monkey Wrench<br/><br/>For Nouns:<br/>Roll d4: 1- person(s) 2- Place 3-Thing (Material) 4-Thing (Abstract)<br/><br/>For Monkey Wrench, Pick 1:<br/>Limitations - Beyond your scope/out of your control; Not enough (finite resources/time); too much (large distances, widespread panic/disease)<br/>Change - Into something new/different<br/>Violence - General destructive forces; Nouns perpetrating against one another or being set upon by external forces<br/>Uncertainty - fear; unclear effect; shift in (ethical, social, cultural, or physical) topography<br/><br/>Things (Abstract):<br/>Cultural - Ethics, traditions, demands<br/>Personal - Ethics, vulnerabilities/insecurities, pride [accomplishments, things you like about you], goals/desires<br/>Societal - Norms/contracts, standing, laws/principles<br/><br/>Hopefully this will be useful to you for the purposes of generating lists for design and lists for actual play.  I recognize this is both monstrous and vague, but I'm hoping the NiC system will help spark some thought as you try to resolve why the Nouns are in Conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449964/#Comment_449964" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-12T10:50:06+00:00" title="December 12, 2015 10:50AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Nathen H did this idea make it ?
