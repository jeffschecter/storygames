A few highlights which came out of the setup:<br/><br/>One of the players chose to be Blind-blue, as a Hocus: our Blind-blue turned out to be grotesque and misshapen but *also* magnetic and desirable, so his player quickly explained that Blind-blue was the head of a sort of fertility cult. He believes that the maelstrom has been affecting people's ability to bear children. Since he's unspoiled by the maelstrom himself, he can transmit fertility by physical contact (probably sex, in most cases).<br/><br/>Blind-blue's fertility cult travels around and offers its women as "breeders", providing the desperate people of Apocalypse World with a chance to have healthy children.<br/><br/>Dustwich is the oldest person around, an aged crone who remembers the Golden Age, and the head of the Bargers. However, the players decided that she was also the one who was unexpectedly pregnant! Naturally, there was no question who had done this: it was Blind-blue. <br/><br/>I loved this development, since Dustwich's story now parallels the tale of Sarah from the Old Testament (who had a child at the age of 100 or something close to that).<br/><br/>A couple of problems came up, but they were easily fixed at the table:<br/><br/>* The player of the Angel chose to "inflitrate" someone's inner circles for the Love Letter, and decided that person would be Blind-blue - another PC. <br/><br/>Since we had already established that they were allies and friends, the choices on the list didn't fit well at all.<br/><br/>If you play this, tell the person choosing that love letter explicitly to "point" it at someone they'd like to take down.<br/><br/>The choice to use their Special should only be allowed with the other PC's permission, of course. That's also important to note.<br/><br/>* Start-of-session moves can feel a little redundant, given the strong starting situation for each character. I told them that, since the first session was short (spent most of the time going through setup and making characters), we'd roll those at the start of the second session and onwards.<br/><br/>A tasty tidbit:<br/><br/>One of the players asked, "Given how terrible people's circumstances are in the post-apocalypse, what do they do to distract themselves from their everyday circumstances, and how fucked up everything is?"<br/><br/>Another answered, without hesitation, that they get high on drugs derived from mudfish. Its rectal glands produce a potent toxin, you see. Remove them from the fish while it's still alive (tricky business, that) and squirt that into your eyes, and you get a crazy high.<br/><br/>So, that was a pretty spicy contribution! Turned the mood at the table up a notch.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/l33land" title="l33land"><img alt="l33land" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/l33land">l33land</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468675/#Comment_468675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-31T02:02:47+00:00" title="December 31, 2017  2:02AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey mate, this is fantastic stuff--I really like (both the form and the content) what you have here and this has helped me to visualize how to set up a cool sandbox.

I appreciate the kind words.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that there is a particular place or repository for this kind of stuff - in fact, my approach to scenario setup in this fashion isn't exactly a widespread thing. However, you're welcome to start a new thread, if you can define what it is you're looking for!<br/><br/>The "Crow's Flats" scenario is modeled after my own Lady Blackbird hack ("A Dinner in Nightport"), which does the same thing but in a much more focused and effective way. In comparison, "Crow's Flats" leaves a lot of bits and pieces to the players and group to settle, which shouldn't be difficult but does leave significant gaps. I really should post "A Dinner in Nightport" sometime, but I've hesitated because it needs a slight rewrite in a couple of sections. It's a fantastic scenario, and uses all the same techniques I have here.<br/><br/>(In my ideal vision, I'd actually rewrite the Apocalypse World rules to be more like "A Dinner in Nightport"; then the conversion would be easier to handle.)<br/><br/>Having said all that, the rest of the inspiration (you'll notice some mechanical ideas, like "Love Letters", which originate in there, as well as a few fictional details like the "mudfish" and the name "Blind-blue") for "Crow's Flats" comes from Vincent Baker's <i>Apocalypse World</i> scenario, "Hatchet City". It's very much worth a read!<br/><br/><a href="http://bignose.whitetree.org/tmp/apocalypse-world/hatchet-city.pdf" rel="nofollow">Hatchet City and Blind-blue</a><br/><br/>Someone else derived their own version of Hatchet City, called Sunken Sydney:<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=1534.0" rel="nofollow">Sunken Sydney</a> (you'll find a working link at the end of the thread)<br/><br/>Finally, I've made another "campaign starter" for <i>Apocalypse World</i>, in quite a different style:<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=5248.0" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse: Emergence</a><br/><br/>I would love to hear about other products, designs, or approaches which share something of the same design ethos.

I'm gonna take some time and peruse these, but even after a quick look through I can tell they are very cool. I'm especially keen on your "Emergence" concept, as I've been thinking on doing something similar for awhile now.<br/><br/>As a GM, I've struggled to find a good Form to use to create compelling modules: The AW Form has been helpful, but I'm still learning and processing it all. Something about your Crow's Flats Campaign helped things "click" a bit for me. I really like the idea of leaving open spaces to allow the players to collaborate; I tend to grip things with an overly-tight fist, and err on the side of over-planning and anxiety.<br/><br/>Anyway thanks again for your willingness to share your ideas.

If you think about it, that's the very basis of the activity of roleplaying.<br/><br/>The scenarios above are as GM-heavy as I would ever go, now, so it's interesting to me that you see them as exemplars of a more freeform or democratic approach. (I've been mostly playing GMless games for the last few years, with a handful of exceptions.)<br/><br/>Since you like this kind of thing, let me also link you to my "starter playset" for Monsterhearts, which I've now used many times and has been a big hit:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/l33land" title="l33land"><img alt="l33land" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/l33land">l33land</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468700/#Comment_468700" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-02T21:31:09+00:00" title="January  2, 2018  9:31PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that term \u201cfruitful void\u201d\u2014that\u2019s just right. <br/><br/>When I GM games, the problem that often tends to crop up (and it could be partly the players) is that people don\u2019t DO stuff, or they don\u2019t seem to be able to envision the array of possibilities before them. There is a bit of a paradox, I think, in that form and constraint can often open up freedom and creativity. If you give players too much freedom, they can be crippled by it (or some can). If you narrow down the field of possibilities, it can sometimes be liberating. <br/><br/>Thanks for sharing that other link, though I\u2019m not as familiar with Monsterhearts or Fiasco.

I find that, given some clear prompts, no one at all has issues being "creative" or exercising their freedom. Our job as designers and GMs is to help bring forth the right combination of constraints and prompts.<br/><br/>One thing I like about my scenario here is that it's equally effective (well, hypothetically -<br/> it's my first time playing it) with rather passive players, who can just pick obvious choices and deal with the immediate situation which results from that, and active or creative players who want to do something unique and cool, like the player who created Blind-blue as her character and more or less took over the aesthetic zeitgeist of the game with her original contributions. As soon as she threw out a few of those ideas, it became instantly clear to everyone at the table that everything else would revolve around those contributions - we all just want to see what happens to Blind-blue! Indeed, the other two characters are basically her sidekicks, as a result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468703/#Comment_468703" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-02T22:51:37+00:00" title="January  2, 2018 10:51PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my impromptu experiments on prompts turned into this game here.

They keep saying they like the system a lot and comparing it to stuff they don't enjoy in D&amp;D, which is interesting! (The usual DM says he gets annoyed sitting there while players look up their spells in their books and try to figure out what to do.)<br/><br/>So, the game was enjoyable in retrospect, but felt a little bit difficult in the moment for me. I think we didn't establish enough connections from the PCs to all the stuff we brainstormed, so we're doing it on the fly. Apocalypse World doesn't help a ton on that front; I'm really missing having Desires or Keys or Beliefs or some other kind of orienting mechanism to work with.<br/><br/>If you use this setup, really emphasize the importance of creating the characters as apart of the NPCs and relationship web you've all invested in during the brainstorm/creation phase.<br/><br/>Afterwards, they said: "Cool!

I'm pretty excited, and don't have any of the usual pre-game anxiety that I normally do!<br/>I've got a "Bonds" mechanic in my game, so hopefully that will help us to establish a web of connections with the characters we've created. I'm also playtesting a new idea that I'm hopeful about: Archetypes. I'm having each character pick/roll for 4 archetypes from a list of 12 (The Rebel, The Ruler, The Sage, etc) and each one has a primary goal or desire that broadly shows what that character would likely want to pursue in any given circumstance (Revolution Against the Powers That Be, Maintaining and Strengthening Order, Obtaining and Utilizing Knowledge, respectively) which I hope will (as I mentioned in an earlier post) help with giving some "freeing limitations" that spark creativity.

You're very kind.<br/><br/>The game appears to have stalled, unfortunately - one of the players involved is too busy to continue, and the others "come as a unit" somewhat. We will see if that is actually the case, but my guess is that it's over. <br/><br/>It's too bad, because Blind-blue's fertility/breeder cult was one of the more interesting things I've seen in a while in an RPG, and I was really looking forward to exploring those themes.<br/><br/>I may start up another game with this "starter", though, to see if it has legs, and to see if I can do an even better job of it on a second run.<br/><br/>I'm not likely to ever run this online, but if I do I can certainly send you an invite!<br/><br/>As for the die types rules:<br/><br/>We used all the modifications in the document in this game. There were a few spots where I had to give it a thought, in terms of conversions (I had forgotten about the Angel's roll+stock, for instance!), but I think it's all in the documents now.<br/><br/>They work well; the odds and spread of outcomes are nice, and it feels good in play.<br/><br/>I find it more interesting and fruitful to focus on creating "bonuses" for the players, generally speaking (that drives more interesting roleplaying behaviour), but you'll notice that, under my scheme, not giving someone a die to roll is effectively a "difficulty penalty", as you suggest. Take a look at my rules for using die types with the standard harm move for another example!<br/><br/>It's a delicate balance, though. AW's simple roll+stat has a beauty to it, and a BIG part of that is not having to have a conversation each time you roll. <br/><br/>Adding dice modifiers means that there's an extra step every time you roll, instead. And that sounds something you really feel - it drags down play just a little. You have try it and see if it's worth it for you.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you're omitting one "math" operation, which allays that a little.<br/><br/>In the game we played here, I only gave something other than a d4 once - Blind-blue was cornered by Tip's soldiers, staring into the headlights, almost unable to see at all. She decided to read a sitch, and she got no dice from the MC. It felt right. (And she rolled a 10+ anyway!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469281/#Comment_469281" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-25T17:44:26+00:00" title="January 25, 2018  5:44PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the one page Intro, I'm glad you think it's effective!

For each answer, take that die.<br/><br/>You get one die from the MC, one from your character, and one from the group.<br/><br/>1. MC, how tough is my opposition? (MC answers.)<br/><br/>* Beyond you. d4<br/>* Challenging. d6 (default: pick this one almost always)<br/>* Pathetic or faltering. d8<br/><br/>2. Am I [hard/cool/etc] enough for this challenge? (You answer.)<br/><br/>* Stat is negative. No dice.<br/>* Stat=0. d4<br/>* Stat+1. d6<br/>* Stat+2. d8<br/>* Stat+3. d10<br/><br/>3. Is your character in a position to meet this challenge? (Answer as a group.)<br/><br/>* No. You're totally unprepared, unequipped, or at some painful disadvantage. No dice.<br/>* Yes. You have the basics necessary to meet the challenge. <b>d4</b><br/>* Yes, and. Yes, and you also have some advantage beyond the usual (you have JUST the perfect tool for the job, or you've taken the time to prepare or position yourself unusually well). <b>d6</b><br/>* Yes, completely. Yes, and you have made sure everything is perfectly in place specifically for this action. <b>d8</b><br/><br/>Roll all the dice together and count the total of the highest two.<br/><br/><br/>Example 1: <br/><br/>Keeler goes aggro on Dremmer, after bashing in Dremmer's buddy's head with a hammer.<br/><br/>Keeler's player gets a d6 from the MC. (Maybe if she had previously seized by force and chosen to "dismay or frighten" Dremmer, she'd get a d8.)<br/><br/>Keeler's hard+1, so she gets a d6 for that.<br/><br/>Keeler's got what she needs in this situation (a weapon to threaten Dremmer), and a little more: she's holding a hammer covered in Dremmer's buddy's blood and grey matter, and poor Dremmer's just put two and two together. She gets a d6 here too.<br/><br/>So, Keeler rolls d6+d6+d6. (Odds somewhere between rolling at +1 and +2.)<br/><br/><br/>Example 2:<br/><br/>Later, she tries to seduce some weird mindfuck called Blindblue.<br/><br/>We've established that Blindblue isn't interested in physical love, taking pleasure directly from the psychic maelstrom somehow. Keeler gets a d4 from the MC.<br/><br/>Keeler's not terribly hot (hot=0), so she gets a second d4.<br/><br/>Keeler's got what she needs to seduce someone (she's wearing some decent clothes, and has a chance to spend some time with Blindblue one-on-one), but nothing special beyond that. She gets a third d4.<br/><br/>Her odds this time are pretty lousy: d4+d4+d4. (Odds are almost exactly like rolling at -1, except with no chance of a 10+ at all.) That's about as bad as it can get with these dice rules. But she could improve her odds by finding the right circumstances or preparing for this encounter in some way (how? maybe some weird psychic business - I don't know). <br/><br/>Maybe if she could get all the circumstances set up just perfect to seduce this weirdo, she'd roll d4+d4+d8 instead, which is similar to rolling at +1 or so in regular AW.<br/><br/><br/>Example 3:<br/><br/>Keeler has been captured and tied to a chair, but she's managed to stand up and to slip one of her arms out of the ropes tying her down. She goes aggro on the dude guarding her, trying to stun him so he'll drop his gun.<br/><br/>She gets a d6 from the MC. (The dude is just a regular dude, of course.)<br/><br/>She gets a d6 for her hard+1. <br/><br/>She gets no dice for circumstances, because her circumstances are pretty bad: she's not really in a position to even make this move, hardly even that.<br/><br/>So she rolls d6+d6 (like rolling 2d6+0 in AW).<br/><br/><br/>Example 4:<br/><br/>Keeler's in her bunker, and this dude Balls has come with his cronies to "negotiate" with her -- except she's pretty sure the only kind of negotiating he's interested in is at the end of a knife. However, Keeler's got three security cameras set up which she can monitor, and she's removed all the trees near the entrance so she can observe anyone approaching for a good, long time.<br/><br/>She rolls to read a charged situation. The MC gives her a d6.<br/><br/>She's wicked sharp (sharp+2), so she takes a d8.<br/><br/>Everything is set up perfectly for this: she's got Balls exactly where she wants him, and she can see everything while he has no idea where she's even watching from. She gets another d8 here.<br/><br/>So, she'll be rolling d6+d8+d8 (very similar to rolling 2d6+3 in AW).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Finally, any move that gives a +1forward should be handled in one of two ways. If it establishes you as having some kind of advantage (which most of them do), that'll affect the group's choice of the third die. If it's a purely mechanical/meta thing, the +1forward allows you to roll an extra d4 instead.<br/><br/>This is fun because it makes misses unlikely, but still reserves a good chance of a partial hit instead of making skilled characters almost always roll 10+.<br/><br/><b><i>Notes</i></b><br/><br/>Overall? <br/><br/>I don't know if this is an improvement over the standard rules: is the extra complication worth it?<br/><br/>But the odds are nice for the possible dice combinations. Bad combinations are still a little more favorable than rolling at -2; and yet even with a +3 stat (called a d10 stat in this version) your odds aren't quite as good as in standard AW, keeping more interesting results. Lots of partial hits at any level rolled.<br/><br/>These rules will encourage your players to prepare much more for moves, position themselves, gather the right tools, etc. <br/><br/>That could be an advantage or disadvantage.<br/><br/>(If you consider it a disadvantage, of course, you could change the third criteria to be something else.)<br/><br/>I also like that it makes it easy to create other traits, and use them when necessary. (Like Dogs traits.) <i>This is a reference to another game I designed using that concept - <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types</a></i><br/><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/l33land" title="l33land"><img alt="l33land" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/l33land">l33land</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469283/#Comment_469283" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-25T18:18:05+00:00" title="January 25, 2018  6:18PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a bummer that your game has stalled.

For instance, I didn't need to talk about specific people at all, because the next stage of ky process was to create NPCs.<br/><br/>I find it interesting, though, that you left out the last thing on the sheet:<br/><br/>An inciting incident, something which gives the people there something to talk about and threatens to change the status quo forever.<br/><br/>To me, that's a really key part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/l33land" title="l33land"><img alt="l33land" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/l33land">l33land</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469287/#Comment_469287" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-25T20:23:03+00:00" title="January 25, 2018  8:23PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly right.<br/><br/>I only included the bit about Place, but after that comes 1) a problem that has recently arisen and 2) NPCs and PC creation. Like I said, I'm very much ripping off your form. I love the idea of the GM bringing a basic idea to the table (a Premise and a Place) and then including the players in the rest of the prep.<br/><br/>I think a big part of what I liked about your form is that it brings the characters into the subtle, interesting knowledge about the relevant NPCs. Many games, in an attempt to avoid metagaming, don't trust the players to have inside information about the world/NPC's/etc. It won't be great for EVERY group of players, but for some groups I think it would be great to include them in the Invention process. <br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to look at the other stuff you've posted, but I'm looking forward to it. I skimmed The Bureau and it looks super cool!<br/><br/>Cheers.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
