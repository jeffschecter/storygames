The people arrived and said nothing; but stared...  Robt wasn't put together yet and Mother decided to get started.  When assembly of Robot was finished and everyone gathered, Robot smiled.  They all went to get ice-cream, but the store was closed!  Robot broke the lock, but the alarm didn't fail.  But Robot and his guests didn't run -- the slipped in.  They ate several bites of ice-cream before the police took them to jail.  Their only amusement was music but they also had free-time.  After a day, Robot was released.  But, Robot's family died there.</i><br/><br/>I played HBR with my kids (8 &amp; 16) last night.  The game is super-easy.  But it wasn't as fast as I expected it to be from reading the book.  My daughter Kivi (8), was especially fidgety when it wasn't her turn to be doing something.  I was the only player to insert words between other pre-existing words.  That's obviously a more sophisticated use, but I was surprised that even Garrett didn't look for opportunities to subvert meanings that way.  Garrett clearly enjoyed the process but thought the subject matter was dorky.  He's going to talk about it with his composition teacher today and maybe take it to school next week or sometime.<br/><br/>Some questions:<br/><br/>How long does it take you to decide how to spend your dice?  How long does it take your kids?  What's your experience with getting kids to insert words, not just (pre|ap)pend them?<br/><br/>I think I'll try it again, maybe adding my wife into the mix and see how it goes as a second play.<br/><br/><br/>ETA: Also, there is are some awkward turns of phrase in the story due to the generation method.  In particular, "...but the alarm didn't fail." is kind of awful.  That resulted from Garrett only having one die/word as the but player and not wanting to be forced into the obvious narrative.  It's an interesting phenomenon, but it also got me thinking: I wonder about an advanced rule for generating a second pass over the story to clean it up.  Or something.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294513/#Comment_294513" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T08:53:29+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  8:53AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa, that's a really heavy way to end the story. Was that the 16-year-old's contribution? I suspect there's this teenage-window where the theme of HBR is too kid-oriented.<br/><br/>If awkward phrases happen, they usually happen with younger players during the first session. I look forward to your second AP. IME, if an adult is the AND or BUT player, they'll be the ones to clean up any awkward grammar since they're usually the ones to pick up the insertion of words more readily than young children.<br/><br/>As for how long it takes me to use my dice, if it takes me longer than ten or fifteen seconds to come up with something, I'll tell the group what it is I'm <i>thinking</i> about. Then I field suggestions for how to make that fit in my word limit and/or ask for coins to make it work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294516/#Comment_294516" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T09:04:58+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  9:04AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The ultimate sentence was mine, the penultimate was Garrett's.  Both were informed by suggestions from Kivi.  I suppose it is grim, but it wasn't feeling that way at the time.<br/><br/>Your ten or fifteen seconds suggestion is funny.  When the kids were having trouble coming up with something that fit their available word-count, I'd ask them to just say what they wanted it to be and maybe we could all help revise it into the right sentence.  But when *I* was having trouble, I just thought harder and felt put on the spot.  I'll totally do that more collaboratively next time; dumb oversight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
