We did things organically back then, kind of going from one thing to the next without a lot of meta-thinking about what we were doing gaming-wise and why.  This led to some good games and some bad games, but no more on either end of the spectrum than is the case now.  But because I didn't do much thinking about what we were doing, I was also ill-equipped to explain it to anyone else.  If you were gaming, then you knew what was up.  If you didn't\u2026 well, good luck having it explained to you.<br/><br/>It was when I tried to get my dad to understand what we were doing that I had my biggest failure in terms of getting someone outside the hobby to understand what roleplaying was and what it was all about.<br/><br/>I had a copy of <i>Boot Hill</i> and I put out the game map that came in the box and I had him choose one of the pregen characters in the back of the book.  We ran a short combat, after which my dad said, "That's it?"  But I didn't get it that <i>combat wasn't the game</i>, so he thought that roleplaying was about rolling some dice, scoring some damage on the enemy and then walking away.  It didn't even occur to me to do something more in depth.  But, hey, I was 13 so you have to cut me some slack.<br/><br/>Basically, though, I'd failed to put across what roleplaying was and why I did it.  I'm curious to know about <i>your</i> biggest mistake when trying to explain roleplaying to somebody.  Did you pick the wrong example, like I did?  Did you drop the person too far into the deep water?  Were you just using the <i>wrong game</i>?  How did it go wrong and what would you do differently if you had the opportunity to do it over?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253780/#Comment_253780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T11:43:10+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 11:43AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!<br/>Good stuff, Sam.<br/>I once thought that someone who was practically paralyzed with creative-performance anxiety might be better served by playing <i>Everway</i>. That, of course, is a great example of "deep end" activity - oracular games in general, especially when they expect a lot of the players, are really hard to start grooving with. Heck, they can be hard for veterans, too, but because of the payoff, we deal with the initial rough patches in the creative process.<br/><br/>I tried to make things "even simpler" (in my mind) by saying, "Let's just tell a story using the Vision Deck!" This met with some rather modest success, but it still fundamentally demanded a good deal of on-the-spot creative juice from her (my friend), and so it was halting and difficult. Silly me - I tried to do an end-run around my own development as a gamer, and get right to the foofy story stuff. Not that that couldn't happen - - I've met people whose first game was Polaris, but Polaris is not trying to be "rules-less"; it has a solid set of rules you use, has a rubric for how to handle squishy or interpretative results, and so on. <br/><br/>If I could do it differently, I would probably get two or three other people together (people my friend trusted! A lot!) and had us all make characters for, say, <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i>. That's a game that puts a lot of the prep in the GM's lap, leaving players mostly aesthetic and simple-tactical choices to make while designing their characters. That would have made things easier for our newbie, as she could both turn to other players for tips and suggestions AND there would have been a lot less expected of her, in general!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253832/#Comment_253832" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T13:23:28+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  1:23PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shit, I somehow managed to completely blow explaining LARP just last week. Some woman at the local whiskey bar more-or-less invited herself to come chat with me and began pushing questions, to force conversation. I don't love my job, so it was easy to make that bit of my reply dull. Being clever, she maneuvered to ask what I "really liked," and I figured that (a) I really like LARP and (b) there's a 90% chance she'll wander off if I wax lyrical about it. So I did--wait a sec... do you think that was a leading question, an opening? Anyway....<br/><br/>Now mind you, I had some drink in me and was one drink short of slipping under; so I wasn't my usual coherent, loquacious self. I recall making one of my usual explanations--"OK, it's like a play, but all the actors create their own characters and there's no script. When there's some kind of argument, we just argue it out; if folks want to come to blows over something, we actually spar with safely padded weapons or Nerf guns or the like."<br/><br/>And she asked--THREE TIMES--how I programmed that. Now, admittedly, I was making reference to GLASS a lot, talking about how I really want to get some extensive playtesting done this spring but it's so hard to find venues and enough people. So, you know, I kept saying possibly misleading words like "system" and "game" and "rule book." But I was also speaking about "State Park campsites" and "friends with lots of acreage."<br/><br/>And then she asks, "But how can you use a computer in the woods?"<br/><br/>I excused myself, told her it was nice to meet her but I really was about to fall down, and headed out the door. I still don't *quite* think her confusion came exclusively from how I explained it, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253847/#Comment_253847" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:04:28+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:04PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>And then she asks, "But how can you use a computer in the woods?"</blockquote>\nA short aside, indulge me: My best friend and I were hanging out after I played a game of Dogs with some other friends.

You be the judge.</i><br/><br/>It was 5:00 on a Friday. I was sitting across the desk from a sour-looking fourth-year medical student who, for the past few eons, had been peevishly grilling me on the ins and outs of my CV. This grueling slog was the final hurdle in three straight days of interviews for medical school, and I was no longer enchanted with the idea of talking - again - about how my extracurricular volunteering made me realize that I wanted to help people and blah blah blah someone please euthanize me now. Neither of us wanted to be there, but like Balboa and Creed in the seventh round, we battled on. I ducked a jab at my community service record and landed a solid blow with visiting a clinic in Africa. My foe stepped back, and looked like he was about to drop. I prepared for the handshake and e-mail address exchange. Then, out of nowhere, a haymaker: "So. What do you do for fun?" I reeled. Why? Why now? Why at the ass-end of 72 hours of interviewing? I looked in his narrowed eyes and saw the malicious truth: he didn't really care what I did for fun, but boy was he going to grind me down right to the bitter end.<br/><br/>There are many excuses that come to mind for why I said what I did. Maybe I was exhausted and fed up. Maybe I was self-sabotaging. Maybe I didn't want to give an answer he was expecting, and maybe I was feeling just a little peevish myself. None of these excuses is wholly true, and none of them comes near to justifying my actions. Whatever the reason, I let fly with this magnificent doozy: "Well, I'm sort of peripherally involved in the indie story game design community."<br/><br/>As we sat in silence for an eternal few seconds, his blank stare rebounding off my mask of forced enthusiasm and ricocheting around the buzzing silence of the room, my mind registered what I'd just said, and somewhere deep in my limbic system, a lone klaxon started sounding. Then all logorrheic hell broke loose. Sounds which may or may not have been actual words poured from my mouth. Mental alarm bells were ringing and neurons were scrambling to battle stations. After three terrible days, my rescue and recovery faculties were running ragged, and all that was left was my brain's arm of FEMA, formaldehyde-poisoned trailers and everything. <br/><br/>"You know, it's independent game designers... like, board games, well, not really <i>board </i>games, but story games, ah... see, they're collaborative games where... where you tell a story together. And they're really interested, I mean, the designers are really, well... <i>we're</i> really interested in the things that make a good story arc, and how rules affect the way people and characters act and the decisions they make in plots and narratives, like game theory... but <i>not</i>, you know, game theory. There's an element of improv, like acting games, and... well. Right. It's more about... collaborative... resolution... understanding, er... using games and rules to explore situations that may be more or less like reality, but with things that are different, and..." I flailed. My interlocutor's face never shifted, never showed the least sign of comprehension or compassion. I ended powerfully: "It's... it's really fun, um."<br/><br/>Looking back, I realize that I made it through my whole critically-fumbling screed without using the word "roleplaying" even once. Whether this is a triumph or yet more travesty, I still haven't decided.<br/><br/>The interview ended soon after that. I thanked him for his time, and left. I won't hear the admissions decision until early next month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254792/#Comment_254792" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T11:41:58+00:00" title="February  3, 2010 11:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Masterfully told, Dan!

My career field was Cryptologic Linguist.  I can't tell you what I did (cue the Top Gun quote) but I spent 7 months learning Spanish via near-total immersion.  <br/><br/>About five and a half months into the course (meaning I spoke reasonably well but not perfectly, had a lot of vocabulary left to learn, and needed a lot of pre-prep for any kind of speech) we were given an assignment, to give an oral explanation of something.  I don't remember the particulars of what we were supposed to explain (I think it may have been a favorite hobby or activity), but for some ungodly reason I chose roleplaying games.  For the life of me I couldn't find the Spanish word for dice, and it seemed to me that the words for play, as in "to play a role", and game, and a play (as in the kind you go to a theater to see), were all the same, as were the words for "role" and "paper".  I'm trying to explain it as "... a paper and pencil roleplaying game is a game in which you play a role, as in a play you would see at the theater" ... and I was even confusing myself.  That combined with the fact that the teacher to whom I was attempting to explain it was the harshest of our group of teachers, and I'm surprised I made it out of that room alive.  <br/><br/>Nowadays I know that roleplaying games are "juegos de rol" but I'm still not sure that says anything at all to someone who doesn't know what juegos de rol are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
