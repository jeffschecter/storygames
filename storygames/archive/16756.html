THERE ARE SO MANY PAGES, YOU GUYS.<br/><br/>I've promised a one-shot of DFRPG for a friend who's leaving town. I have ideas about what a faerie knight, a white court virgin and a mortal hunter allying in NYC to maintain a balance between the cities' powers, probably at the the behest of the Dragon that lives under the city, but otherwise, I'm just stumped!<br/><br/>No one here is obligated to do my game prep for me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382894/#Comment_382894" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T11:58:24+00:00" title="June 20, 2012 11:58AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And well we shouldn't.<br/><br/>The point is that you don't need the prep time. Sit down with your players and build magical NYC with your friend who's leaving town. If you focus on only two major power factions you should be able to get through the city creation in about an hour, maybe less.<br/><br/>Instead of following the directions exactly, just list off three or four major factions verbally and ask the players to pick two. Then define a representative and a heavy for each of them.<br/><br/>How much time have you set aside for this one-shot?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
