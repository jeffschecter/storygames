Also, consider that, at least in my town, Indie gaming is not really known, so we're still staying in the  field of bigger publishers. as a player, all of my first experiences were with 3.5E, and, even if it IS full of flaws, it sticks in my mind as the 'honest" system that can more or less get trimmed to fit the situation, and that everybody knows and agrees to play with. the 4th Edition, on the other hand, has been shunned as the death of roleplaying by most gamers i know: when i read the player's  manual, my shocked  reaction really was something like "oh my god, they've turned it into WoW, with the roles to fit like tank and dps, and the alignment system has been cut down to a for-dummies version! this is horrible!!!" (i do not like the 3E alignments, but making them more simple makes it even worse)... <br/>\nNow, i end up here, and i read totally opposite opinions, by players who seem worth of trust. This makes me think that maybe my judgment of D&amp;D 4E was a little bit rash (i DID have a prejudice against the new D&amp;D edition, i admit), and there might be more to it than what i saw in the first place, so... would anyone of you who has tried the system share some of the experience acquired, and tell me which are its pros and cons?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249905/#Comment_249905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T05:10:42+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  5:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the first thing that comes to mind is that it's pretty difficult to consider the pros and cons of something like a roleplaying game. They're different games that do different things, the only way you can even get into an edition fight is if you have such a narrow view of roleplaying that you can put all games on a line and arrange them according to their strengths and weaknesses... but really, think about it: isn't it obvious that if your needs are different, the game you'll want to play will be different as well? There are no pros and cons because something that is a good thing for one goal in play might be bad for another goal.<br/><br/>Thus, not so much pros and cons of the fourth edition, but a characterization of <i>what it is good at</i>: I would choose the 4th edition of D&amp;D over the third if I wanted to follow the rules rigorously, concentrate on skirmish battles and make a big deal of fair play with no GM cheating. The fourth edition simply does these things better, it's a better skirmish game. I'd take the third edition over the fourth if I wanted to give primacy to fiction over the rules, or if I wanted to have more complex strategic issues on the table - the third edition is a much more strategic game than the fourth, which concertedly strives to minimize fictional considerations that break the encounter model of the game. So if I enjoy stuff like avoiding a combat encounter altogether by doing things that are reasonable in the fiction, then the third edition approach works much better than the fourth, which assumes that the players only make choices that matter once the combat encounter has already started.<br/><br/>Notably I'd say that both games work about equally well when you inject enough railroading into the mix - which to my understanding is the norm in GMing these games. In that case it's just a matter of superficial system aesthetics. If the players want clarity, they'll prefer fourth edition, or if they want complexity and organic systems, they'll go for the third.<br/><br/>That's just scratching the surface, though - these are complex games we're talking about, with many differences. One is better than the other for many purposes, and for many purposes they're both pretty bad. Your best bet is to figure out what you want to do and choose the game accordingly, rather than try to find out which game is absolutely better than the other - there is no answer, as it all depends on what you want to do with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249908/#Comment_249908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T06:34:41+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  6:34AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Eero's approach, but not necessarily with the conclusions. Fourth Edition's primary non-combat system (the skill challenge) is, to my mind and in my experience, just as robust as Third Edition's. What it loses in flexibility it gains in specific structures for all challenges. Even in 3e's "reward them for out-of-combat stuff" advice sections it was pretty clear that non-combat challenges were essentially seen as minimal, throw-away things, often just single rolls. In 4e, a big elaborate skill challenge can be as important as a combat and you are directed to spend time working on how to structure it, a big change from "just roll the right skill at the right time" advice.<br/><br/>This:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Your best bet is to figure out what you want to do and choose the game accordingly, rather than try to find out which game is absolutely better than the other - there is no answer, as it all depends on what you want to do with the game.</blockquote>\nis true of all games forever, though. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249911/#Comment_249911" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T07:27:44+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  7:27AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2010 7:30AM by Albi_SG.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Eero Tuovinen<br/>\nThus, not so much pros and cons of the fourth edition, but a characterization ofwhat it is good at:<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what i wanted to know, actually, i just had written it down in a bad way (my english is not perfect). i did not intend to get into an edition fight (iknow the 3rd edition sufficiently to know where it's good and where it fails), the main focus was getting some insight on the 4E, because i had a pretty bad impression of it, but i was curious to be proved wrong...<br/>\n<br/>\nthe thing that JD mentions about the skill challenges is VERY interesting, and i had not noticed it. <br/>\n<br/>\nEero, i had the impression that the 4E combat was somewhat video-game like... would you confirm this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249917/#Comment_249917" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T08:00:18+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  8:00AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is video-game like... or rather, <i>game-like</i>: unlike many roleplaying games, 4th edition D&amp;D doesn't really pay even lip service to the idea that rules are there just to model the fictional reality. In 4th edition even more so than 3rd, you can't really ignore the fact that the rules actually define the in-game reality. This is mostly an issue of attitude, of course - I'd say that a group needs to willfully play against the book to get into a situation where mere description trumps the clear-cut rules procedures set down in the game text. The game-like, artificial feel many people (myself included) get from 4th edition is mainly because of this feature.<br/><br/>Trying to put the feel into words... a lot of the feel in the 3rd edition and other games of its ilk comes from the notion that the players are exploring unknown territory when they engage the rules system and the GM in various combinations of activities. In a traditional roleplaying game like 3rd edition D&amp;D you'll assume that zany events that push the boundaries of the rules system and require GM interpretation are a matter of course - in fact, the purpose of the game, the extra something that makes for memorable play. In 4th edition, on the other hand, you assume that anything and everything you can do in the game has already been exhaustively playtested and balanced; finding something the designer has not accounted for is a failure of the game, not an assumed part of play. I myself find that in 4th edition D&amp;D you don't really rely on the fiction as the basis for the decisions you make, but rather the rules system; in older editions the fiction plays a much larger role, and is in fact the common basis on which to make decisions.<br/><br/>Also, I might disagree with the claim that the skill challenge system means that the 4th edition supports organic out-of-combat activities better than the essentially traditional 3rd edition approach. Skill challenges are just another type of dicing contest with carefully predetermined consequences, not the venue of absolute freedom that free play in traditional rpgs is. I don't have a horse in this race, though, so who cares.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249933/#Comment_249933" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T09:13:28+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  9:13AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Engaging in 3E/4E edition wars on the internet is just about as stupid as talking about health care reform or the Israeli/Palestinian conflict on the internet, but I just wanted to throw in an AP data point.<br/><br/>Having played, I don't agree that in 4E there's no room for experimentation outside the strict structure - even in combat, which is where the structure is the strictest.  In games I've played in, we've swung from chains, I've pushed an ally through a window so he'd end up behind cover from my dragon breath, I've thrown someone into moving gears, gotten swept along by a river, had PCs take cover behind a spinning waterwheel, brought the ceiling down on a dragon, and all sorts of zany things of that ilk.

We aren't really going to get anywhere if each point that anybody tries to make is immediately refuted with a disagreeing anecdote. Is it really that controversial a claim that the 4th edition rules, taken at face value, de-emphasize the fictional conditions in comparison to the 3rd edition? Maybe it is and I've just misunderstood that game text. Either way, I have no doubt that the group playing the game has a massive amount of leeway, whatever the system, to emphasize whatever they want.<br/><br/>I mean - do you really disagree, Daniel? Is 4th edition really the more imaginatively intensive of these two games? Or is it just your group that orients to the fiction?

In both games, a player can say, "I want to do X" where X is pretty much whatever.  In 3E, a GM would adjudicate using the Skill rules as best s/he could, or just handwaving (in pretty much *every* trad game - or even non-trad game, witness the use of NFA in the 3:16 missions thread - I've ever run or played a lot of use is made - generally encouraged by the rules - of "OK, uh, roll [SKILL/STAT] and if you beat a [NUMBER] it works") .  In 4E, a GM adjudicates as best as s/he can, using Skill Challenge rules, those stunting charts in the DMG, or just handwaving.  <br/><br/>I mean, I have no problem with folks who like 3E.  I played a lot of 3E.  I'd play something other than 4E if I had people to play it with.  The point of the anecdote was just to show that something people have asserted is difficult or impossible under 4E is not difficult or impossible, in my experience (I wish I could do logical operators here, 'cause then I could show a little backwards E for existential quantification).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249943/#Comment_249943" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T09:47:49+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  9:47AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have relatively limited experience with 4e, having tried it just a few times. From what I've seen, though, I have to agree with the main thrust of Eero's point. By and large, it seems like one of 4e's design goals was to minimize the question "Well, is it reasonable?" from play, at least with regard to things happening in combat.<br/><br/>Perhaps an example would help illustrate what I mean. (Powers are completely made up based on memory; I don't have books to refer to here).<br/><br/>In 4e, your character might have a power called "Intimidating Stare". The game effect is to force an opponent to move one square away from you. Fictionally, this is due to your impressive ability to manifest menacing facial expressions. But in the rules, all that matters is that you pass the appropriate check, and then the other figure gets moved. This is going to hold true whether or not your character has a bag over his head, or your opponent is a gray ooze, or last week the guy you're fighting saw you singing the lead in "My Fair Lady". The fact that it's called "Intimidating Stare" is almost irrelevant. In fact, I believe the books encourage you to change all of the 'color' associated with a power to match your character concept. You could call it "Belly Shove" if you're playing a Sumo wrestler, and keep everything else the same.<br/><br/>It's my impression that 3e leans more toward taking the description of the power and basing decisions off of that, falling back to the rules only if there is nothing vague about the situation to discuss. If I were playing 3e, I'd be fairly complacent about my GM ruling that my Intimidating Stare ability doesn't work on the blind guy.

My goal as the DM is to try to plan fresh scenarios that are loaded with fictional opportunity and consequence, and which will provoke interesting mechanical situations.  I'm learning that I really love that constraint, that it focuses my efforts rather than handcuffs them.  <br/><br/>For instance, whenever possible, I want to design my 4E scenarios to engage the inter-encounter resource management issue that is really the heart of 4E. I want to make the use of scarce resources like healing surges, daily powers, and action points as tense as possible.  I want to cram our adventures and encounters with engaging enough fictional consequences so that I can put fiction-driven storytelling and gamer pragmatism in tension.   This lets me hammer on the 'why do you fight?' and 'who do you fight for?' themes really hard.<br/><br/>So for me, it is not a primacy of rules over fiction; it's a matter of optimally fitting the fiction and the rule system.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Notably I'd say that both games work about equally well when you inject enough railroading into the mix - which to my understanding is the norm in GMing these games.</blockquote>\nI would characterize our 4E play as subway play; once the players are on a track they'll stay on that track, but they're free to jump off at a station and find another track, and I make a point of highlighting the opportunities to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249970/#Comment_249970" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T13:21:04+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  1:21PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albi_SG</cite>whoah, looks like i've really started an edition war. which is funny, because i acquired the concept of edition war when eero mentioned it.

You can very easily learn the rules to playing a basic D&amp;D character in under say, an hour, if you like examples and assuming your a player. The complexity of 4th edition comes in that, from the core rules (roll a d20, add half your level, then the appropriate attribute bonus) they add in class based rules. So each player becomes a expert in their class because the rules for playing a wizard are encompassed in the wizard class, and then the wizard powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nCon: Jumping into the game can be very hard. If you're going to play a 10th level or 20th level character or 30th level character right off, without having played the prior levels, it is going to be difficult the first few combat encounters as you try to absorb all the rules that you need to learn to play that class.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro: Once you get going, combat can be /extremely/ fast. A full 20th level encounter can be played in an hour assuming everybody knows their characters, their powers, and doesn't take excessively long to decide what to do.<br/>\nCon: Combat can be gruelingly long if you have a slow decider or a bunch of people who don't know how to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro/Con (Depending on your view point): The game is largely setting free. Each power has a name and flavor text. The races have just enough background and the setting just enough detail for players and the DM to just get down to playing, if they want to play, or to add their own detail as they like and flesh out the world if they like. I'm particularly fond of the Points of Light idea, and that humans are not the predominate culture and that there is no real predominate culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro/Con: Roleplaying in 4th edition is very much a you get as much as you give. Few of the rules enforce roleplaying but neither do they exclude it. Most every power has enough flavor text to be interesting and help enliven the use of the power. Skill challenges can be as down to earth or as esoteric as the D&amp;M or players wish. In my own gaming group I've encouraged my players to actually explain what their powers do, once the rolling is done.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro: The game is far better balanced for the purposes of determining skirmish encounters than its prior editions. The encounter building system was something I absolutely fell in love with and was one of the reasons why I actually started running D&amp;D encounters. It provides me with a group of monsters, what their uses in an encounter are, and how many of them I can include in an encounter before it gets too powerful for my particular group of players, in a more mathematical way. With the inclusion of online tools to modify monsters and create new ones within similar specs, I don't have to worry too much about unbalancing the game, as a new GM, and have more flexibility as a veteran GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro/Con: Treasure is handled in a slightly confusing fashion. You gain access to magic items fairly early but the system is setup such that trading out magic items (IE selling them and purchasing others) is strictly a worse idea than using the magic items you're given. Its fairly counter to the older style of play. The game also encourages the party do their own crafting rather than going into town and buying, which helps solve the economy problems of D&amp;D IMO but might not be the style of game play you're looking for. Ultimately this means that the DM has to either pick and choose treasure for the party that they think party will like, or convince the party to have at least one enchanter, or give the party extra loot to "disenchant" or sell, such that they're still on par with the leveling system. That being said, unlike before, the magic items are level based and therefor far far easier to balance. I know what magic items I can give my players and how much power I'm effectively giving them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro/Con: The game is actually somewhat similar to the popular fantasy MMOs we've played. This means that MMO players have an easy time picking up on the game. I consider this a pro. I also do like playing MMOs sometimes so playing such a game at the tabletop is kind of fun. Ultimately adding my own story to the game play instead of playing the scripted version where everybody talks in acronyms is far more satisfying for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro: All the characters are balanced in how much thought and time you need to put into them. Since every class has powers and special maneuvers they can do on top of simply swinging their weapons, the game becomes far more versatile and fun to play no matter the class you pick. Each class, depending on its powers, does play very differently however, so you can't always claim to dislike the game play based off of one character class.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro: The game's structure makes it very modular. Which means it is also very easy to design for and tack on your own stuff. The online community and designers actually encourage it. Making up new powers is actually fairly simple once you've played the game enough and most of the time that is all you need for customization. I've had to create numerous familiars for my magical classes because they didn't like the standard ones which was a lot of fun. Plus there tons of source material to draw from for ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro: The DMG is an extremely useful tool in 4th edition. Not just a depository of goodies and NPCs and random tables. It teaches you how to teach the game. Talks about the various style of players you encounter (explorer, power gamer, wall flower, etc) and how to deal with them. It teaches you the new encounter system, adds a few extra rules for variant play. Artifacts are awesome in 4th edition, not just more powerful magic items, IMO. I'd recommend parts of the 4th edition DMG to anybody who wants to run a game on any system.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro/Con: Yes the rules in their pure form are very gamist (On the gamist/simulationist/narravist scale) and there are even some rules in the very back of the DMG suggesting how you might play without a DM (apparently inspired by one of the creators who originally "played" D&amp;D without really reading the rules so he never knew there needed to be a DM). Whether this is a pro or con to you is really up to you. I like that I don't have to keep track of spells in terms of minuets anymore but know that my bow fires 6 squares... well in my head I just translate that to 30 feet anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is probably more but thats all I could think of right now. I tried to keep the pros and cons high level. Hope that helps. For what its worth, I play in both 3rd and 4th edition games but no Pathfinder games yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249993/#Comment_249993" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T16:44:43+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  4:44PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nojh</cite>The DMG is an extremely useful tool in 4th edition.

My overall opinion--I like 4e more.  When I play DnD, I want it to be a game about strong, empowered heroes overcoming challenges.  I want to put moral and ethical challenges in front of the players and watch them overcome them.  I want play to consist of scenes which alternate between 5-15 person skirmish combats, tense arguments, and daring stunt-filled action sequences.  When I run DnD, I find that it has a very pulpy feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that 4e does that better for me than 3.5 does.  From my experience, what 4e really did was 1) balance the play experience between all types of characters and 2) make explicit things which previous editions always assumed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to 1), I could only ever stand to play a spellcaster in previous editions because they were the only characters that had any variety in what they did.  Fighters could press their "Attack" button over and over again.  The system encouraged tactics that were repetitive and relatively simple.  Casters got to use a bunch of different spells.  4e essentially gives everyone spells, giving everyone that fun kind of variety.  Each class feels differently and has a different set of tactics involved, but everyone gets to make meaningful choices in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint 2), however, is 4e's strongpoint, I think.  Every edition of DnD has assumed that a party consists of thief who picks locks and backstabs people, a wizard who shoots fireballs, a cleric who heals, and a fighter who gets in the way of the monsters.  These four roles have existed since original basic DnD.  In 3.5, these roles exist--everyone knows that a party needs a cleric, for example--but they aren't explicit.  They still affect how the game is played, but, because they aren't stated in the text, they sometimes fail.  Because the defender role was assumed and imagined, but not described outright, the fighter that fills the role can't really protect other characters.  The bard class has no effective role because the designers didn't consider how each class is supposed to contribute.  DnD is at its core a game about teams overcoming challenges, and 4e is the first edition to embrace that and really consider explicitly how that should affect the design of character classes.  Roles are not a WoW-ism, but really just the concrete statement about why the traditional party exists and what each person is supposed to do, in order to ensure that everyone can do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, in my experience, DnD has always been a game about combats interspersed with various types of other challenges, in which the characters use other abilities and for which they should also be rewarded.  4e just acknowledges that assumed structure and provides a mechanical structure to complement it.  The skill challenge rules provide a mechanical tool to highlight those other types of challenges and make them as dynamic and exciting as combat is.  4e is easier for me to run my kind of games because it provides me a system for the daring action scenes and tense negotiations that I include in a way that 3.5 never approached.  Often in 3.5, what should have been an awesome scene where the characters try to cross a pit, for example, was resolved in a few die rolls or some simple narration (e.g. "We jump across." or "We chop down a tree so that it falls across as a bridge.".  In 4e, there is a structure for these scenes.  What should be tense, exciting challenges can't be overcome with one die roll, and narration and cleverness is given an obvious way to be rewarded.  In the above example, dropping the tree correctly could be given a skill check or perhaps an automatic success, which contributes partway to the overall success at overcoming the challenge.  This same mechanical structure also helps me as a GM to decide how to respond to the narration.  In the same example, if the characters need a few more successes to beat the skill challenge after dropping the tree, that tells me that the scene isn't over.  I should introduce a new complication to further challenge the characters and the ingenuity of the players.  Without the structure, I would probably have just ended the scene and wouldn't have thought to make it more dynamic and more exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, 4e doesn't feel like a video game to me or my players.  Yes, the combat has some qualities that demand some suspension of disbelief to ensure the system works smoothly (the "Intimidating Stare" example above fits here), but that is really a small quality of the system.  Moreso, it is a game whose mechanics strongly influence the fiction, much as games like Burning Wheel do, and which explicitly states its design goals rather than pretending they're not there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250023/#Comment_250023" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T00:09:22+00:00" title="January  8, 2010 12:09AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balthazar</cite>*snip good stuff*<br/>It's my impression that 3e leans more toward taking the description of the power and basing decisions off of that, falling back to the rules only if there is nothing vague about the situation to discuss. If I were playing 3e, I'd be fairly complacent about my GM ruling that my Intimidating Stare ability doesn't work on the blind guy. If I were playing 4e, I'd feel cheated, since I just lost the use of my ability due to my failure to make up a different set of weaselly color text for my ability that didn't have any in-game fictional drawbacks.</blockquote>\nYes, this. I got the same feeling about 4E when it landed in my hands. A lot of the powers don't really make sense in-fiction, but they are very useful and tactically sensible and appropriate when you're just moving figures on the grid. Reading 4E powers feels like reading Magic cards to me sometimes. a) there's a bit of fluff, a picture, a name that suggests what sort of fictional event this provokes is and then there's b) the mechanical event which is sometimes wildly inappropriate, because it's not balanced in respect to the fiction, but the other mechanical effects and the game's specific mana/power/toughness/life economies.<br/><br/>Like, in 3E, I wouldn't try to grapple and ooze. It's an ooze, it doesn't make sense grappling it.<br/>In 4E if I have a power that's <i>called</i> Strongman Grapple that deals damage to the opponent plus prevents it from moving and attacking for the round, I'd use it. And as balthazar said, I'd feel cheated if the GM said it didn't work, "you can't do it, you can't grapple an ooze", because a) I'd just wasted a power b) because I was using the power because of its mechanical effect, not the fiction. <br/>[I'm making this up by the way]<br/><br/>I might contrast this with Mouse Guard where if you do a Maneuver and Disarm your opponent, you deny them the use of their weapon. Again, how the hell do I "disarm" and owl? But, MG as written encourages you not to think in terms of an actual disarm but just describe how you use your bow (for example) so that the owl is unable to attack with its claws - for example you shoot it through the wing, forcing it to land or whatever. The effects are still balanced, but you're encouraged to make the fiction fit.<br/>I think 4E would have done better if they'd just made away with the fancy names and fluffy descriptions for the individual powers but rather made broader fiction-agnostic categories of effects and combos. Most of them basically boil down to extra moves, shifts, extra damage, resource denials, heals, marks and buffs.<br/><br/>But then they would probably lose the shiny, sense-tingling shopping list effect that D&amp;D does so well. You know, the carrot that keeps you playing. "Oooh, check this cool new power I got when we leveled up." sort of took the place of "Oooh, check this cool new shiny sword I got." from previous editions. The purpose of both is to kill dudes and take their stuff, so yeah,<i> the game is still the same</i>.<br/><br/><br/>That said, I'm pretty neutral about both editions, they do their own respective things fairly well. 4E is quite a more polished than 3E however, 3E was a bit all over the place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250066/#Comment_250066" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T10:21:14+00:00" title="January  8, 2010 10:21AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2010 10:22AM by Wordman.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One impression that may be worth mentioning involves positioning. In 3E, position was relevant (for stuff like flanking, can I see that guy, can I move there, etc.) but not hugely important. It's something that exists and that you use. Once of the largest changes in the feel of the game, to me, is that in 4e, position is something that you <i>manipulate</i>, in well defined ways. Instead of "that guy moves there", it is now often "I move that guy there". This turns out to have a big impact on how 4e feels, as this is a big part of where its "board game" vibe comes from.<br/><br/>If the goal is to discover if "there might be more to it than what i saw in the first place", one thing you might try is to read 4e pretending that it doesn't have the words "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" on the cover. If you read it as if it were some entirely new game, you will get a vastly different impression of it than reading it with the assumption "this is going to be like 3.5, but <i>improved</i>". The two editions really aren't the same kind of animal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250180/#Comment_250180" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-09T16:10:44+00:00" title="January  9, 2010  4:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, this is some information now, and i'm also setting out to read the manual again.

I haven't experienced this and have not seen any signs of that in the various texts (DMGs, adventures) I've read for the game. Mostly the between-encounters play is about triggering the next encounter by saying the right things to the DM; this is natural, as there aren't many rules or procedures for it, so it's basically spinning your wheels in freeform when you're not playing out a combat or skill challenge.<br/><br/>Of course, what is an encounter and what's not is not simply about combat in 4th edition due to the skill challenge thing - it's quite feasible and actually commendable to make important social scenes into skill challenges, in which case we might say that the non-combat abilities of characters get to matter. This is basic application of the skill system, though, with no powers - there is no sane or ratified method for including the power system into non-combat situations, really - I seem to remember reading something about how the DM can give out extra successes to PCs who spend their powers on a skill challenge or something like that, but there's no solid rule for it.<br/><br/>The ritual magic thing is interesting in that in the games I've witnessed so far the ritual magic has been rather useless for the procedure. This comes about due to the encounter-focus of the game: you the player should never waste significant resources on ritual magic strategically speaking, as there are in fact no consequences for unpreparedness that the DM can throw out that would actually be negative from your viewpoint. The next combat encounter will be balanced anyway, or the DM is a jerk, so maneuvering about with ritual magic or other elaborate non-encounter play is a bit pointless from that viewpoint. I'm sure that this could be played around with more sophisticated DMing, but it's probably the DM guides that have discouraged that sort of thing where I've witnessed the game - the DM guide is pretty railroady, all told, and considers the DM to be responsible for arranging the game so that the heroes win.<br/><br/>All of the above is, of course, dependent on how a given group actually applies the game. D&amp;D has such a strong and varied tradition of goals and GMing strategies that anything that's not directly encoded into the procedures of the rules-set is liable to change at a moment's notice. For instance, I would have no trouble at all throwing out the encounter xp budgets, treasure parcels, adventure design and other balancing measures put into the game if I wanted to, which would go a long way towards turning the game upside down. The 4th edition is, first and foremost, a robust skirmish combat game - the elements external to that are somewhat arbitrary, which probably accounts for much when people report completely contradictory experiences with a game like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250197/#Comment_250197" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T00:23:13+00:00" title="January 10, 2010 12:23AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think local practice does have a huge effect on D&amp;D play.

Locally, the DMs never ever EVER point out the minions on the map. The possibility of "wasting" a special attack on a minion is part of the gambling element of the game here.

It doesn't help that it's nearly impossible to fit more than two combat encounters into a four-hour session (regardless of character level).  Most of the DMs have used material published by Wizards for their adventures.  Regardless of whether or not there is less for characters to do outside of combat than previous editions, which I believe is the case, an overwhelming amount of the 4th Edition text is devoted to combat encounters, so I don't think it's surprising that combat tends to dominate people's games in exclusion of other pursuits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250331/#Comment_250331" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T11:01:00+00:00" title="January 11, 2010 11:01AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some subset of 3E players get the most enjoyment from the game when they can find cools uses for spells out of combat or for non-combat spells within combat. Sort of a "given I have this tool in my box, how can I most creatively use it". Players like this tend to hate 4E, because 4E doesn't allow that kind of play very well out of the box (although, there may be some untapped potential for it rituals; I just haven't seen any).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
