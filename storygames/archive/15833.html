So I'm considering trying it sans map. I know, I know: the map has been part of the charm, but I think it could work great purely in <i>the realm of our imagination!</i> and whatnot. Even without the map, I think the core system would work great.<br/><br/>What problems would that create? How would we place advantage dice? Don't know.<br/><br/>Upside is that we'd probably play it a lot more.

Use some Post-it notes and write a few interesting locations or problems ("We're leaking oxygen!"), writing character names on those notes or using smaller stickies to mark them.  For Geiger, you don't really need specific locations for the characters as much as you need some vague idea of where they are and what they might be up to.  The map is really just a way of tracking the intents and fictional positioning of a dozen characters at once, which is more than you typically have to worry about in an RPG. (Interestingly, Metrofinal has similar tracking issues, which it handles in a related but somewhat different way).<br/><br/>If you want to play totally without any physical reminder, you could use the character record cards to record what each character was up to last, like you would record a "Goal" in Burning Wheel or Mouse Guard, which sometimes changes ("See what's going wrong in the engine room") and sometimes stays the same scene-to-scene ("Assassinate the commander").  Then, when framing a scene, start by picking one character to frame it around.  They'll tell you what their character was up to and then other players can volunteer that their character might be involved, based on their own previously-declared intentions.  That way, each player only has to track what their characters are doing.  Still, in the latter option, you might want a sketchy map of the setting on the table, created as play progresses, but you don't need to mark character locations on it.<br/><br/>I have some other thoughts about how to revise the scene framing rules in Geiger Counter, but they don't have anything to do with the map as-such, so maybe that's a separate discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359761/#Comment_359761" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T08:55:13+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  8:55AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sadly, the links on that page for the GC Alpha and Alpha play sheet are broken.

The main issue we encountered was that thinking about fictional positioning in terms of static locations only goes so far.  Sometimes a character is running from one place to another place or a number of characters are all lost in the woods but not lost <i>together</i>.  So, yes, notecards are cool, but you need to be willing to be pretty loose with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
