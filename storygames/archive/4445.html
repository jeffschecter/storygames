Deadline for submissions is January 1st, 2008.<br/> <br/>The International Journal of Role Playing invites researchers, designers, developers, academics, artists and others involved in the growing field of research related to role playing to submit articles. The IJRP is a peer-reviewed journal, and welcomes submissions from any sphere of interest, knowledge network, research field or development sector that directly or indirectly relates to role playing interests.<br/> <br/>Potential topics include but are certainly not limited to the following:<br/><br/>    * Role playing games, e.g. frameworks, storytelling and graphics; art, design and creative industry<br/>    * Role playing culture, psychology, media, economics, and sociology<br/>    * Role playing technology, surveys, vocabulary, training and education<br/>    * Other aspects of role playing and related research and development<br/> <br/>The International Journal of Role Playing is a biannual international journal that covers all aspects of role playing, irrespective of the medium, platform or intent. The IJRP specifically aims to act as the focal point, for pushing the limits of role-playing knowledge, and to improve sharing of knowledge across the knowledge networks involved with role playing- and related work, notably the industry, the academia and the arts. The journal will encourage the exchange of ideas and experiences, and will be a free, online forum where knowledge can be harvested.  In realizing that the knowledge networks involved with role playing- and related work are based in a variety of interest spheres, which write and publish their work in different ways, the IJRP will accommodate the knowledge sharing principles of the various networks.<br/> <br/>The International Journal of Role Playing is an innovative, novel platform for knowledge sharing that reaches across traditional fields, and will treat submissions from academia, industry and creative forces on an equal basis through a joint publication framework, which is specifically designed to accommodate contributions from all of these diverse sources.<br/> <br/>All submissions will be peer reviewed by three members of the multi-disciplinary editorial boards, who represent the diverse interests of the knowledge networks involved in role playing and related work, e.g. academia, industry and the arts. All submissions will be reviewed by experts from the knowledge network of the submission, together with at least one reviewer from a different network. Through this and other initiatives, the IJRP aims to assist authors in promoting cross-network aspects of their work. <br/> <br/>The International Journal of Role Playing is an online publication backed up by on-demand printing. The IJRP aims to have all papers go through their initial review within three months of receipt. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, following the instructions on the IJRP website: www.play.blogs.com/rp, which also contains important dates and deadlines.<br/> <br/>The IJRP specifically aims at providing authors with a higher than usual degree of freedom in composing their manuscripts and expressing ideas.
