The idea is this, "Build an MMO like environment with few people and a focus on story".  Even as I write this down the idea sounds mad.  The price you would need to charge for a game where only, say, 1,000 people can play is far more than the market can bare but I still think it might work.  The problem is how do you deliver on the promise of story for every player and how do you do it enough to make the people playing the game feel like you have given them a value for the money they spent.  The question of creating meaningful story leads to the equaly difficult question of how do you design the game in a way that the players can tell you what they want in such a way that they don't feel like they had to explain what they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that I thought of when these questions occured was to bring them here.  The designers and want-to-be designers here are some of the best at getting their players to tell them what they want stories about.  Many games even start this at character creation and build out wards with the player laying down the tracks where they want to go.  This is also the community to talk to when you are thinking about drasticly changing the publication system of a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that you will tell me I am insane and give me the solid push I need to seek professional help.  But if on the other hand my dimentia spreads to you through the intar-tubes I would be glad to dive into this delusion with you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189354/#Comment_189354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T09:52:50+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  9:52AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 9:54AM by tony_dowler.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Josh. I don't think this is a wrong idea at all. I guess that means we suffer the same pathology.<br/><br/>I think the idea that a story-focused limited-player MMO (let\u2019s call it a story-MMO for short) seems insane is that our expectations of an MMO are conditioned by the MMOs that dominate the market. These are mass appeal MMOs with high production values. As long as you're willing to abandon some of their assumptions, then I think the goal of a story-MMO is possible. In fact, there are several candidates out there already. I'm not sure any of them actually achieves the goal (though maybe someone will bring one up).<br/><br/>The first candidate I can think of is MUDs. I know at least one company was offering a story-based MUD as one of its premium online offerings. I wish I could dig up the link, but the name escapes me right now. The tradeoff is there are no 3D graphics.<br/><br/>Then there are platforms for multiplayer role-playing that can be used to create an environment for story. There are still lots of people who get together to role-play on private <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/" rel="nofollow">Neverwinter Nights II</a> servers. Here it's largely the fan base that creates content. There might be some of this going on in <a href="http://secondlife.com/" rel="nofollow">Second Life</a> too.<br/><br/>Finally, there may be a convergence of tabletop role-playing and online tools. <a href="http://www.ddo.com/" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Online</a> probably isn't the story-MMO platform we're looking for, but it's a step in the right direction. I know there have been discussions on SG about online tools for playing PTA and other indie story games. Can anyone point us in the right direction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189360/#Comment_189360" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T10:12:54+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 10:12AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.vassalengine.org" rel="nofollow">Vassal</a> is currently the right direction, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan" title="jmhpfan"><img alt="jmhpfan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan">jmhpfan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189361/#Comment_189361" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T10:19:15+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 10:19AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been a part of both the NWN and the SL communities and they are both great in their own rights but NWN is too focused on the combat and the GM rails and it is hard to focus on any one thing in SL.  What I would like to see is a game where from the moment you sign in and start making your character you are investing that character with the story you want to help tell.  I am imagining a game where the GMs and the players work together to build meaningful stories together.  I think that part of the way a game like this would make money is selling the rights to view as the story unfolds around different characters.  To be sure my dream vision is aimed at a very select group of people and I hope that they exist and they are wanting this as badly as I do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189366/#Comment_189366" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T10:26:54+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 10:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jmhpfan</cite>The price you would need to charge for a game where only, say, 1,000 people can play is far more than the market can bare</blockquote>There are several MMOs that have been running for years with fewer than 1000 players.

Basically, Josh, you're looking to see if you can be the content provider for one very large roleplaying group.  What would people pay for this service, to have the game world revolve around their characters?  $2 a month?  $5?  $10?  I imagine for such a premium and select service, you wouldn't have to worry about competing with the pricing of the big subscription MMOs.<br/><br/>I think the audience exists for this product and would be more than willing to pay generously for the experience.  The presentation would have to be attractive, but wouldn't need to be state-of-the-art.  There would have to be some kind of underlying game system to handle what people wanted to do in the game.  I have no technical expertise with which to even begin imagining what that side of this undertaking would be like.  But if my full-time job was to provide content for the players, well, it certainly seems doable.<br/><br/>And as far as that content is concerned, it seems that the easiest and most fun for the players would be to set up the situation (something like rival kingdoms besieged on all sides) and let the players decide what they want to do.  Perhaps they play the political game in the former capitol.  Maybe they fight orcs in the borderlands.  Participate in intrigue in the college of mages.  As long as a few players go after every hook, and spend more time interacting with each other than with the NPCs, the story will write itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189370/#Comment_189370" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T10:37:07+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 10:37AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jmhpfan</cite>The price you would need to charge for a game where only, say, 1,000 people can play is far more than the market can bare</blockquote>I don't think this is necessarily true.  Granted, I know little about business, but there's not reason, I don't think, that you'd have to limit the entire game to 1,000 people.  Just like WoW has different servers that have their own characters living in them and don't interact, you could do the same sort of thing with this idea.  The main difference would be that, over time, each server, or world or whatever, would start to become very, very different from one another.<br/><br/>Not only do I think this should happen, I think it NEEDS to happen in order for certain games, or types of games, to be feasible.  For example, ever since White Wolf and CCP merged (or CCP bought them, or whatever actually happened, I don't know) there have been rumors about an eventual WoD MMO.  I'm not sure about much in the world, but I am sure that if a WoD MMO appeared as was basically like WoW in modern cities with vampires and werewolves it will be complete and utter shit.  In order for a WoD MMO to work (or any MMO with a horror theme, in my opinion) it should be rather like you describe, with a much smaller number of players in each server or instance of the world, as well as a world that is, at least somewhat persistant.<br/>Ten years ago or so, I used to play on a few MUSHes, and basically, if you give people an interesting environment that can change and hold its changes, and people create interesting characters, and the number of players is both small enough that it's possible to meet and know at least a significant minority of everyone playing, story will happen.  You may need "game masters" of some sort if you want to create large plots that affect everyone, but the interactions of players and the groups they form will create a lot of individual stories naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan" title="jmhpfan"><img alt="jmhpfan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan">jmhpfan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189372/#Comment_189372" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T10:45:58+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 10:45AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am still debating the role of NPCs.  On one hand lots of NPC's means that the players have someone to interact with when the other players are not arround on the other hand they can often lead to the feeling that you are playing solo.  I think the best course would be to make the PCs into NPCs when they are not online.  Allow the player to dictate messeges for other characters, actions for their character and emergency responces for if things go pear-shaped while they are away.  A great interactive feature would be a outside chat (text messages) and a NPC editor (cell phone or web app), these would allow the player to make changes and keep in touch with their world even while engaged in their everyday life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189374/#Comment_189374" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T10:52:00+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 10:52AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 10:56AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was involved in the beta testing of Skotos' Castle Marrach, which was very much a low-pop text-based virtual world with narrative as the primary goal, especially during the playtest period.  I really wish Skotos had fulfilled their original goals of opening up their software for people to construct their own micro-level virtual worlds.  I would be all over that in a heartbeat.  Current, Skotos runs <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/prose.php" rel="nofollow">a number of low-pop, low-tech virtual worlds</a> (in addition to other types of games) that I don't have much familiarity with, but their engine and the basic model is really solid, I think.  Also, <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/" rel="nofollow">their collection of articles on small MU design</a> is an invaluable resource for people planning this type of thing.  I actually think most indie games could benefit from designers reading a bunch of those articles.  I know I learned a HUGE amount.  It actually has a lot in common with small larp design and jeep, actually.<br/><br/>P.S.

I've also wanted to learn Inform 7 and write some IF games, and I've never done that.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189393/#Comment_189393" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T11:55:56+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 11:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, I don't have a lot of experience with other text-based games, so it's hard to compare.  The ones I have played besides Skotos' games have been fairly limited things programmed by a few people working together and Skotos' games totally blow those out of the water, in several regards (Java-based client, object-oriented programming, very detailed, interactive environments, relatively natural command entry, quality of player base, etc.), but it's been, uh, 5 years since I played one, so I'm not sure how much of that is current. I imagine they lost a ton of players to WoW and the like.  Honestly, they did just about everything I would want a text-based environment to do, but I left just as they were implementing a lot of things that I found distracting and un-fun (characters speaking different languages, skills that you could increase by practicing, etc.). I was basically looking for a fun place to engage other people in character and pursue our own invented plots, as in a freeform larp. I didn't like how engaging in those mini-games changed the structure of social relations (making it more like video game-style virtual worlds), but I'd be interested in seeing them work in a different game that wasn't Castle Marrach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189397/#Comment_189397" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T12:09:52+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 12:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole idea that this could even be looked at without thinking about what MU*s have done over the last 20 years is madness on a level only previously approached by White Wolf's online chat RPG.

In my mind, there's this continuum that goes "group of people in a chat client -&gt; free MU -&gt; Skotos" when it comes to level of structure within which you basically have freeform chat-based larps.  Honestly, free MUs don't do much for my play priorities that couldn't be almost as easily done on an IRC channel.  But Skotos was much more immersive and interactive, to the point where I could see the benefits of coding an environment to play in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189418/#Comment_189418" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T12:58:21+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 12:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked at any of the Web 2.0 games as a possible medium?

Players deserve to experience the best that the creators of these games can produce and that bar needs to be raised.  Games like Mass Effect, Oblivion and Fable have started down this road but don't go nearly far enough and don't offer a multiplayer experience.  I want help from the designers here with developing a system that allows players to be as active and as proactive as they want to be.

I wonder if those ideas are really that compatable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me, that the sort of people who really want to own the world and tell stories interactively and not be railroaded...are already the sort of people who can do that without needing 3d graphics.  They're the sort of people already playing in online chat rooms and with pen and paper and seeing their worlds in their own imagination in "higher res" and "more polygons" than any computer is capable of churning out...especially if designed on a budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, I've played Oblivion and Fable and enjoyed the heck out of them...but that was only marginally for the graphics and not at all for the roleplaying freedom.   I also don't really think its possible to design a computer 3d game that really can duplicate a true interactive story based roleplaying experience because ultimately the story will always be "railroaded" simply by the limitations of what the designer chose to render in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to steal your sword while you're sleeping I can't do that in your game unless you've included a system whereby players are required to sleep and take off their gear when they do so.  If I want to tear down a peasant shack and build a stone watchtower I can't do that unless your game lets me destroy buildings and build new ones.  So even in the most open ended of open ended computer games you're still not going to be able to duplicate even a small part of what people on their own can do just by talking/typing and imagining.  At that point, your 3d graphics are likely to make the experience WORSE for me, because they won't be depicting what we players in the game are saying that we're doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what there probably is a demand for is a service that will allow me to role play with Jonathan and Brian and Jason and Tony as if we were all sitting around the same table...and let us play whatever game we want without the loss of interactivity that current on-line play aids have.  But that doesn't really require 3-D graphics either...maybe a good webcam...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe that's just my being a bit of a luddite.  Can you speak a bit more of what experience you're trying to deliver with an MMO format?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189434/#Comment_189434" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T14:22:02+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  2:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Adam Dray</b> already chimed in, but I highly recommend that you contact him.

Mind you, a lot of the MUSH community thinks that the way I do things is fucking insane, and I can't always disagree. If I had it to do again, it might not be a huge-codey thing cuz it's a lot of work and maintenance, but it was cool and few people had really done anything like it on the MUSH/MUX platform in 1996, so I forged ahead. <br/><br/>A lot of the MUSH games are pretty low-code. They have some code for chargen, some code for dice rolling against people's character sheets, and not a whole lot else except utility crap like bulletin boards and 'who is online and where are they' stuff. That works, but it relies on the players not to be asshats and resolve things all on their own and figure out their own plots and stuff, or it requires a GM to step in and do those things. Firan substitutes code for the GM wherever it's feasible. We automate tons of stuff, right down to our infamous choice to write commands for having babies. Whee. (But it's a god-damned multi-generational game now in it's 4th or 5th generation, so childbearing stuff is important to the players' stories.)<br/><br/>Players have a tool to roll dice against their stats. It's loosely based on old Storyteller attribute+skill vs. target dice pools, with the rough statistical edges filed off with a bad-ass dremel. They use it to resolve a lot of stuff so they don't have to call a GM for trivial shit.<br/><br/>We still GM a fair amount. We get to focus our GM time on stuff that has the biggest impact to the most players instead of resolving every damned thing. The "plots" we run are things like important legal trials, kidnappings, angry deities (plagues of locusts, lightning strikes, etc.), and wars between Firan clans or between the Firan people and the evil humanoid race that plagues them.<br/><br/>If you were gonna drop a GNS label on it, you might call it Simulationist drifting towards total incoherence. The game itself is so detailed that it has to be some kind of terrible fetishization of the original fantasy setting we created. But my wife Steph is a professional fiction author, and she wants the game and its players to tell cool moral stories, and that tends to push a Narrativist agenda. The code sometimes encourages players to min-max skills and other scoring indicators ("social points," for example) to be The Best, and those people seem to be pretty much anchored in Gamist territory. Occasionally, there are serious clashes where players get all up in each others' grills over what seems like a Creative Agenda war over "the right way to play." If we step in as staff, we tend to resolve those things with a Sim hand, relying on what is most believable in the setting. More often than not, though, we do whatever is most fun, as long as it doesn't violate Sim principles.<br/><br/>Firan has a roster of several hundred pre-generated characters. You can browse the roster, pick one, and jump into play quickly. They come ready with backgrounds, personalities, stats, secrets, and relationships to other characters (often played, but not always). Sometimes other people played those characters before you. That can be weird, but also awesome as long as the character isn't way out of date. Still, there's nothing like stepping into a character who is already in trouble in a fun way. There's a very simple-to-use system to create your own character, too, but those characters tend to be hollow shells compared to the ones the staff creates. Really, there are only like two or three people (including Steph) who make roster characters that pass our muster on the first inspection. Shit, I can't do it without a couple revision passes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189442/#Comment_189442" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T14:52:43+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  2:52PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>As much as Firan makes me stare in unapologetic horror and hie myself away to the hills, definitely there's something to be learned there.</blockquote>\nAs an object lesson of what not to do, I suppose, for many people. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> But we had 100+ unique players (260+ characters) connected the other night for the civil war plot we're running, and people seem to be having fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189446/#Comment_189446" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T15:10:21+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  3:10PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's exactly what I mean - Firan has had high logins for a really extended period, whereas the games I actually like have stumbled over their own shoelaces and fallen down the stairs in the dark and died dozens of times over in the same time period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue" title="Greentongue"><img alt="Greentongue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue">Greentongue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189462/#Comment_189462" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T17:29:41+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  5:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 5:31PM by Greentongue.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: ValamirIf I want to tear down a peasant shack and build a stone watchtower I can't do that unless your game lets me destroy buildings and build new ones.

The setting must be small enough where the PC population will be the largest group of characters in the game at any given time.  There needs to be a good reason for these people to be so far removed from other civilizations so that there is no possibility of going "outside".  This would all take place on one server so that the GMs could be as involved as possible with the players (controling the few NPCs and setting their away controls when they are not being used).  There would be no static texts of "Welcome traveler, would you like to buy my wares" becouse even when the NPC is not being controled by a GM the GM who is in control of that NPC would have set personalized messages for the players who they interact with the most offten.  All of this is why a game like this would cost so much.  Building a world large enough to feel like you are alone and changeible enough to allow players to build and destroy as they deem fit.  It is a big idea and it needs some people who can think big to help develop it.  Thinking of scaling back is for later.

That takes code. But what's the purpose of that code, anyway? Why do you need a "cup of mead" object? Generally, you could just include that kind of dressing in your role-play without any problem. (But! If you were doing something like Waiting/Tea and you had an important prop like a Bucket, you should probably create and describe it.)<br/><br/>Likewise, geography is pretty simple. You <a href="/forums/profile/dig">@dig</a> "rooms" and describe them and you can open one- or two-way exits between any two rooms. People can generally travel freely between these areas. Each room is really just a localized place. When you use the SAY command to talk, only the people in the same room as you can hear you. It organizes conversations. Use rooms like Primetime Adventures "sets" -- that is, intelligently. Don't dig every damned spot you can imagine.<br/><br/>So, imagine you have 5-7 "sets" for your Dogs game. You <a href="/forums/profile/dig">@dig</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/describe">@describe</a> them. You link them in appropriate ways. Maybe there are a handful of important props that you leave around: they're part of the story, not just window dressing. Window dressing belongs in the static room descriptions. You can pretty easily create NPCs that are programmed to spout off something whenever they hear a certain phrase (text matching). <br/><br/><b>Here's what I'll do: Let's pick an evening and I'll give a demo/tour/tutorial to anyone who wants one on FoundryMUSH.</b> Someone needs to pick a good date and time for  this.

I know you can run a small, functional game without a lot of GM-touch. As a game grows larger, however, the law of averages gets you. You might have a half dozen really good players who create the fun on their own, and a hundred average players who want to be GMed out of their bar RP. Generally, I try to cultivate a game culture that tells people to make their own fun, to take chances with their characters, and to push the fun outward to other people. In my experience, that doesn't work <i>on its own</i> for a larger game, and we designed Firan to be a larger game, from the get-go.<br/><br/>For the record, I love 99% of my players (okay, so there are maybe three players I don't love). I generally trust them not to abuse the game or each other. When left alone, a lot of them entertain themselves, but a lot of them do not, and then the game stagnates. This is why we GM large-scale events that give players something to react to. They're like Kickers in Sorcerer and we build them around characters as much as possible because why bother otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan" title="jmhpfan"><img alt="jmhpfan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan">jmhpfan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189534/#Comment_189534" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T08:12:32+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  8:12AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All PCs will be NPCs when they are not logged in.  They will be able to quickly decide what person, faction or group they want to receive the message when they come to call as well as being able to quickly design conversation trees for any of these messages.  All conversation from player to player will be done in voice chat with different levels of range based on thier voice level.  NPC conversations will also be voice based with the players recording the conversation choices they want others to hear and a list of possible replies provided buy the systems voice recognition software.  With any luck this game will have no need of a key board.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM NPCs will have all of these features available to them to run their characters.  The main difference between the PCs and the NPCs will be how much time a human spends controling them.  Imagine this like it were a marionette show where even if the puppeteer is off using another puppet the other puppets that are on stage remain there to be picked up and used as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of a generational game quite alot with death being perminant and the only hope for "rebirth" is to take over one of the unclamed generation "X" NPCs.  I don't know if this will be enough of an incentive for PCs to marry and persue families but I am quite sure it will be a deterent to fighting loosing battles.  The question I am most currious about is peoples thoughts on death by old age in a system like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189535/#Comment_189535" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T08:14:09+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  8:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>What kind of place is FoundryMUSH?</blockquote>\nIt's a social-hang-out MUSH (TM 3.1) with some rooms and coded objects for playing tabletop RPGs.

However, between, oh, I dunno 1996 and 2001 I did quite a lot of it, mostly on WoD and Changeling MUSHes and not only did I not expect the staff to entertain me, I generally didn't want them to.  I tended to avoid game-wide plots (though I didn't ignore their existence) and instead my "stories" tended to focus on my character's relationships with others.<br/>Granted, if I was on a Skotos place, or otherwise paying to play a MUSH-like game, I'd probably expect more in the "staff-produced entertainment" area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189551/#Comment_189551" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:19:23+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:19AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you play the same character for five years straight?

I mean, the ones I played most were Changeling-only WoD games.  Those didn't get that big.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It's a rough guess, but the one I played the most was even smaller than the first one I played, and I'd guess it probably had no more than 50 regular players at its peak, quite possibly less.  I played multiple characters, but one was the same the whole time, though he migrated from one game to another (someone I'd played with on the first game started up the second, and quite a few of the people she knew came over)<br/>Sooo yeah, I may not be typical, but in retrospect, I'm seeing that having staff that tries to keep things interesting and taking part in those kind of things would be good.  I think many of the times I made new characters was when I was starting to get a little bored with what was going on with my old ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189589/#Comment_189589" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T11:30:52+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 11:30AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuity is really important for story-driven games. That's one of the reasons that Firan went the pre-gen character route. Even if a player disappears, the storyline for that character doesn't have to die. The roster system isn't perfect (like poorly updated characters is a plague on our souls) but I think the game is better with it than without it.<br/><br/>A game doesn't have to have staff running plots. It just seems to me like you'd want that, cuz you get a better game that way. Yeah, there are people who want to be left alone, like Daniel up there. Player-run plots (PRPs) have their own troubles, too. For example, enforcement of canon.<br/><br/>See, in a tabletop story game with a lot of co-authorship, if you don't like something, you're at the table and can say, "What the fuck?" and correct it before it gets out of hand. A MUSH is more like a LARP. I had 170 characters logged in the other night, role-playing all over the game in small groups. I don't want to watch them (and generally don't) and I often have no idea what they're up to until it's done. I really can't give them any kind of co-authorship over the world outside of their character's choices and our interpretation of the consequences. I know for a fact that players make shit up that doesn't fit into Steph's and my vision of the game. Further, most of the players <i>like</i> that vision of the game, and they don't want a random player suddenly saying that the world they play in is radically different than anyone thought. <br/><br/>Yeah, I suppose I could just let go and see where the players took the thing, but I'm not interested in spending time and money to run a free game that isn't something that moves me. The players have a ton of input into events on the game, but they have to result from in-character actions. They can't just invent flying ships or introduce aasimar characters because they think that'd be cool.<br/><br/>Anyway, if we let players make stuff up, we wouldn't find out about it till it was too late for anyone (staff, players -- anyone) to have a say. We do entertain player suggestions on our web forum, and implement the ones we like when we have time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189603/#Comment_189603" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T12:45:12+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 12:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I'm not interested in spending time and money to run a free game that isn't something that moves me.</blockquote>I think this is important.

I don't have much experience with doing so (thus making me presumably like the players on this game) and it seems to me that designing a conversation tree complex and interesting enough that I would be willing to let it stand in for my own character would be a lot of work. And then I have to voice-act it as well? And then I have to do this more than once if I want my character to react differently to different people? Sounds like way too much work for me, with little reward.<br/><br/>I am not sure what the goal would be for such a system; there will always be a huge gap between interacting with an NPC and interacting with a PC, so why would anyone want to interact with an NPC-ized PC anyways? And why would the owner of said PC want other players to interact with a dumbed-down, non-reactive version of their character -- interactions that they then will have missed, and be unable to incorporate into their own play?<br/><br/>I think I'd need to hear more about what you see the players doing in the larger environment before commenting on the merits of generational play or approaches to character death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189682/#Comment_189682" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T22:21:13+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 10:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe this hasn't been posted yet, but <a href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/" rel="nofollow">Love</a> is totally a Not-a-lot multiplayer online rpg being made that is focused on story and it looks beautiful.
