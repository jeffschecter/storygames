(beware spoilers)<br/><br/>Sixteen brave folk -- gypsies, hunters, charcoal burners, navigators, rat catchers, beggars, and a lone squire with a longsword -- sail the Starless Sea to the Great Ziggurat of Chaos.  After losing five of their number to the grasping tentacles of the Starless Sea's kraken, they stand twenty feet off from the ziggurat.  The two archers take up their bows and start to thin out the ravening horde of beast-folk mutants who are cheering on a terrible ritual atop the pyramid.  The mutants descend the ziggurat's ramps and dive into the water and swim at them!  The party desperately rows away and keep up their bow-fire, but the mutants outnumber them 2 to 1 and eventually they surge over the gunnels! <br/><br/>The PCs roll <b>three critical hits</b> on the boarding party.  The mutants, their numbers thinned by half, their morale broken, flee from the brave villagers!<br/><br/>Alas, the party was unable to interrupt the ritual that freed the Night On Bald Mountain chaos-thing from its ziggurat prison.  When its giant corruscating form broke free, they fled back to their village and warned of the doom that had been invoked deep in the Starless Sea!<br/><br/>I treasure my four years as a 4E DM but I don't think I can go back now.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386247/#Comment_386247" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T13:40:17+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  1:40PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DCC is a kind of stupid-crazy magic.

Everyone is preparing for a wedding, and Victor Knight, brilliant-but-tactless, has been convinced to ask the sister of the bride, Angelina, for a couple of dances during the wedding.<br/><br/>Gregory, a shapeshifter: Do you know how to dance?<br/><br/>Victor: I can learn very quickly. Gregory, let's dance.<br/><br/>Gregory obligingly took on Angelina's shape.<br/><br/>Victor: You have her hair wrong --She parts it differently.<br/><br/>Gregory: I wanted to make sure you could tell the difference.<br/><br/>Victor (have I mentioned one of his aspects is Truth Before Tact?): Oh, you're inaccurate enough I can tell the difference. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gregory is going to accompany the 9-inch clockwork fairy, Sophronia. He made the mistake of telling Victor that Victor would never guess who he was going with. This lead to Victor following leads, Sophronia and Gregory planting red herrings, as represented by Sophronia's glamour of a large red herring, Victor reading Gregory's mail, and Victor throwing cold iron nails through Sophronia's illusions. This has had the result of annoying Sophronia, and angering and scaring Gregory (who has a few secrets).<br/><br/>Another fairy, commiserating with Sophronia: Friends don't use cold iron on friends!<br/><br/>And, the NPC Lord Mace bantered with Gregory about seals. Gregory stressed he was talking about the animals. Lord Mace was talking about wax seals.<br/><br/>Lord Mace: I would be a little disconcerted if they up and danced on their own.<br/><br/>Gregory and Victor, simultaneously, to Sophronia: Don't! <br/><br/>This led to a philosophical discussion about what "on their own" meant.

(The groom got kidnapped by the Tower Gang, while the bride's sister went off to solve a mystery and got captured -- but had been smart enough to leave a detailed note of what she was investigating and where.)<br/><br/>But, first, Gregory the shapeshifter (who is actually Gregory's servant, Reginald, as all the players, but none of the PCs know) decided to have it out with Victor's activities from last session, which included sneaking into Gregory's home and reading his mail. I can't type as fast as they can talk, so there are gaps.<br/><br/>Gregory: Victor, are you aware that you are absolutely terrible at keeping secrets?<br/><br/>Victor: Yes.<br/><br/>Gregory: Do you regard this as a problem?<br/><br/>Victor: No.<br/><br/>(hiatus)<br/><br/>Victor: You're concerned that if you tell me your secrets, someone will rip them out of my mind?<br/><br/>Gregory: No, I'm concerned that you're going to blab them all over creation of your own free will.<br/><br/>Victor: So, what secrets do you have that are dangerous?<br/><br/>(hiatus)<br/><br/>Gregory: Use that powerful mind of yours to think past that moment of revelation when the truth comes to life, and think about the moment after that, about the people...<br/><br/>Victor: I cannot be held responsible for my mother.<br/><br/>Gregory: Ah, yes, that is a rather egregious outlier. That can be taken as a statistical error.<br/><br/>Then Gregory tried to draw a complicated analogy, involving Lady Alice's (another PC) secrets and Victor's wagging tongue.<br/><br/>Gregory: Imagine that she were your sister -- imagine what that would do to her chances of marriage.<br/><br/>Victor: I don't think that Alice would be happy with a marriage to someone who only saw her as a society lady.<br/><br/>Gregory: You're missing the point. Extricating her from her situation, without anaesthetic or planning might cause a great deal of trauma and hemorahging....<br/><br/>(hiatus)<br/><br/>Victor: What brought this on?<br/><br/>Gregory: I don't like it when you read my mail.<br/><br/>Victor: Oh. I'm sorry about that.<br/><br/>Gregory: No, you're not.<br/><br/>Victor: Well, I'm sorry you're upset.<br/><br/>Gregory: That doesn't count.<br/><br/>He asked Victor not to do that sort of thing again, unless the need was dire, and doing it merely to figure out who Gregory was taking to the wedding (which was the fourth PC, Sophronia, the 9-inch clockwork fairy) did not constitute a Dire Need.<br/><br/>Me: Unfortunately, the GM has an endless supply of fate points to compel.<br/><br/>Alden (who plays Gregory Sage, aka The Pennsington Heir): Yes, but when he starts messing with the Pennsingtons --<br/><br/>Me: The GM has an endless supply of fate points to compel.<br/><br/>Back on the character level:<br/><br/>Gregory: People can take care of themselves without unusual abilities.<br/><br/>Victor: Most of the time.<br/><br/>Gregory conceded that was the case, and that there might arise a situation where the need was indeed dire.<br/><br/>Gregory: In any case, if you feel this to be true, please feel free to violate as much of my privacy as you feel absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>Kristen (who plays Sophronia): You want your booby trap to go off. <br/><br/>The "booby trap" is a letter intended to be easily findable on a full search, such as would happen if Gregory were presumed dead by the PCs (which is Gregory's reason for writing it -- Alden's is that he wants it found) and which is not actually a booby trap, but actually a confession that Gregory is actually Reginald, and an explanation for why this is so (the real Gregory is living happily in Africa, specifically in the Congo, and the GM is desperately trying to cram enough information that she won't do an utterly sucky job of running something there, especially given that the player very much wants an adventure there, which is only reasonable. I'm starting with gaming material, as I also need An Adventure, but what I have covers other parts of Africa, or other decades, or both. I'm going to have to do some research on the Congo in 1840, give or take a couple of years.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386532/#Comment_386532" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T03:39:32+00:00" title="August  7, 2012  3:39AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D, Tomb of the Iron God. <br/><br/>When we returned to the temple, we found the campsite of another adventuring party.

These nasty flying insects are drawn to human emotions, paralyze their victims with psychic emanations, and lay eggs in their brains. (Think Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind meets Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri).<br/><br/>Kite the battlebabe and Rex the gunlugger decide to head out into The Bloom to the ruins of a airport to scavenge machine parts for an airship that Ace (an NPC warlord) is building. This, of course, triggers a custom move:<br/><br/>When you venture into The Bloom, roll+weird and start the swarm countdown clock. On a 10+, the skrael are quiet, start at 3:00, on a 7-9, you can hear their hum in the distance, start at 9:00, and on a miss, they are circling on the horizon, start at 11:00. Advance the clock one segment every time you destroy the weeds, commit violence, or show strong emotion. At midnight, the swarm attacks.<br/><br/>Kite's player rolls... and misses.<br/><br/>Kite, Rex, and a few NPC lackeys arrive at the airport and scavenge some parts without incident, then turn around to go back, but they're cut off by Doghead (Ace's second in command) and her gang. Doghead demands the PCs hand over the goods for her to deliver. She thinks these upstarts are trying to show her up to the boss; she isn't about to let anyone replace her. Rex levels her machine gun, and tells Doghead to get out of the way. The Go Aggro roll succeeds on a 10+ and... Doghead sucks it up. As she hits the ground, the swarm descends.<br/><br/>That was the most intense standoff I've seen in AW so far, and the chaos that ensued was delicious.

It was a very dark situation.<br/><br/>Four officers (Medical, Bridge, Weapons, and Engineering) faced peril aboard a damaged starship.<br/><br/>The Engineering officer faced a crew mutiny, and the rest of us offered to help. However, her concern for the crew (she wanted order restored, but would not allow her crew to be hurt), complicated things wonderfully. For example, Medical offered to flood the corridors with a sedative, but there was a possibility that this might cause respiratory problems to some of them. And the Bridge offered to turn on anti-personnel subsonic noise waves, but there was a chance that some of the mutinous crew might be killed. Ultimately, Engineering was able to escape the ship.<br/><br/>It was discovered that the Weapons officer had murdered another crew member in order to prevent anyone from discovering our classified cargo. When the Weapons officer was infected by a hideous pathogen, the Medical officer refused to treat him -- calling him a murderer.<br/><br/>The Medical officer got into an escape pod, and the Weapons officer succumbed to the virus (which we learned had been engineered by the Medical officer's team).<br/><br/>I was the ranking officer on the Bridge; when another crew member discovered that I was a Zorian spy, they left me behind.<br/><br/>I died when the ship's hull imploded.

And Quintin's minstrel revealing that he was secretly a Noble, because he had a dream where a princess contacted him! (these two characters hit level 5, where you get to add a second class on top of your original class).<br/><br/>* Travis' merchant/cobbler, Mister Green, crafts desert boots, anticipating that the group will be traveling over a desert soon (they will). Fails. Oops. Three more days.<br/><br/>* The group tackles the city of Cliffedge's problem, a mine currently closed because of rumors of ghosts.<br/><br/>* The group encounters a strong matron foreman of the mine, who hires them to get the ghost issue settled; people go missing then later reappear, claiming it was ghosts. The group decides to explore the mine rather than, like, beating up everyone spreading ghost rumors. :-)<br/><br/>* They encounter a tall, twitchy miner who disappeared for a few days. Through a caffeine haze, he tells the party (in between throwing a hand sign and saying "Hail Gargantua!" under his breath) that the ghosts are a ruse, in reality it's actually Gargantua, King of the Deep, and he simply invites everyone to a delicious meal then recruits them to his royal spy army.<br/><br/>* The PCs gear up on canaries to detect the wacky-gas that everyone in the mine was clearly exposed to.<br/><br/>* Fun fact: 1 ration: 3 gold. 1 canary: 2 gold.<br/><br/>* They explore the mine, almost dying to death. There was a mine cart roller coaster ride. They meet another miner, who has never seen the ghosts nor been abducted. The players mention "Gargantua", the miner looks at them like they are mentally damaged and has no idea what they are talking about. Clearly the gas problems are deeper.<br/><br/>* At the bottom of the mine, they run into Gargantua, lord of the giant mole people. He invites them to his royal banquet, spread before them. The session ends, and the players have two weeks to wonder if its real or if they're huffing wacky gas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388068/#Comment_388068" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T09:57:45+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  9:57AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World:<br/><br/>The party are a bunch of assholes. <br/><br/>While hunting a griffin in a ruined city the Dwarven Fighter gets separated from the group and pinned down by the griffin. He hides in a collapsed building, only to discover a mutant ALSO hiding. The mutant tries to get him to leave, so the Fighter provokes the mutant into attacking him. He succeeds, drawing the mutant into the door frame where he is EVISCERATED by the griffin. The he cuts the griffin in half with a single blow. <br/><br/>Later the King of the Mutants calls him out for killing one of their kin (not 100% fair, but he DID get the guy killed).

Season finale!<br/><br/>Fairly early on in the season Clara, the fae, got a cop killed sort of by accident. She asked her dad, the faerie king, for help in 'dealing' with him, and botched the roll, so I decided he gave her want she wanted and them some: unleashing The Wild Hunt on him. Since then, an NPC teenage Monster Hunter in their class has sort of had Clara on his radar, picking up bits and pieces here and there and clues as to what she was, and certain other things she's done.  His first attempt to kill her didn't go quite so well, since she had Jennifer, a werewolf and Benedict, a ghost, in her corner, so he cooked up a different plan that he suspected they might go along with, since his chat with each of them revealed that they were kind of concerned about some of her behaviors: a potion that would kill the "fae part" of her. In theory! The problem is, she's tied up in a hospital, and has sensibly warned the authorities of who stabbed her, and what he looked like, so he can't just saunter in and get it.<br/><br/>But he could try to convince the other PCs to! Which, aided by some visions from the Abyss, he manages. Of course, Clara doesn't make things easy on them: she declares she isn't thirsty, looks askance at the water bottle "that's already been opened", and when Benedict tried to just slip it into her IV the cop watching her room kind of noticed! So Jennifer provided a "distraction" while Benedict does his dirty work.<br/><br/>Clara convulses! Throbbing veins! Flatlining! Lots of 'oh shit!' from PCs and NPC nurses and doctors alike... and then she vomits forth this mass of alien colors that swirls off into the air like dissipating mist. Cue the end of season.<br/><br/>Afterwards, and when all the other players have left, we have a discussion about where the player wants to go with the character, or even if she survives. The 'Mortal', being more Bella than Xander, didn't really fit what he had in mind, but then I had an idea. A part of her soul has been killed, leaving only emptiness inside behind, right?<br/><br/>I passed the player the Hollow Skin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388503/#Comment_388503" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T22:14:09+00:00" title="August 27, 2012 10:14PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome!

One player made the Pure Sacrifice into basically a bunny themed magical girl. There is also a Tweaky Shaman (an unwashed feral boy), an Angsty Shadow Warrior, and an Explosive Mage (who despite making things explode has a way of fading into the background and being forgotten). The first session appropriately consisted mostly of flailing around, fighting some not very smart demons, and encountering a sickly boy who wears a magical cat ear hair band and his psychotic older sister who wears fox ears.<br/><br/>The new rules I put in place seem to be working pretty well so far. I think the Story Threads mechanic I put in place of History needs some work as it was too easy for players to pick those without putting them in the context with what the other players were doing (and having just started reading Monster of the Week I really like how it has many connections that have questions that one person or the other has to answer). On the other hand, the Guts points that players can spend to avoid Falling Down seem to be working really well, as does the mechanic of letting players simply level up once per session rather than marking experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388697/#Comment_388697" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T09:36:25+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  9:36AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Dragon World] Ewen, if you get the new revision of the rules posted before then, I <b>will</b> run this again when my turn to GM comes up in three weeks.

Character creation was a blast; I especially liked the archetype-based stat packages.<br/><br/>Also, in Dragon World, snowballing moves seem to create snowballing comedy.  As I was attempting to carefully make my way down into a treacherous chasm, I failed my roll and went tumbling down towards the Tweaky Shaman.  Mistaking me in my shiny, black armor for a shiny, black boulder, he promptly called down the wrath of the storm spirits, zapping me (and several hidden gnomes) with lightning.  His roll, however, was a weak hit, so it triggered another rockslide, burying him waist-deep in rubble.  As I lay unconscious and smoldering (having not spent a Guts point to avoid Falling Down), the Shaman forced his way out of the pile of rocks, shapeshifted into his polar bear form, and slung my limp body across his back to carry me out of the chasm.<br/><br/>Not the most hilarious recounting of the experience, maybe, but at the table this was all pretty funny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388705/#Comment_388705" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T10:51:48+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 10:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2012 10:52AM by UserClone.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Monsterhearts 2] Jennifer's mind got changed fairly quickly about the deal between Samuel and Clara after she heard a laundry list of psychotic things Clara had done, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388709/#Comment_388709" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T11:39:42+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 11:39AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Monsterhearts] Just wait until Jennifer has a laundry list of her own!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388755/#Comment_388755" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T17:14:00+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  5:14PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[Dragon World] Ewen, if you get the new revision of the rules posted before then, I <b>will</b> run this again when my turn to GM comes up in three weeks.
