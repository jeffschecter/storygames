After killing its extended family living in Plymouth, it becomes a true undead Nachzehrer vampire and feeds off the down and outs of Plymouth. Having eaten human remains it is able to see the Ghouls and soon defeats the leader of the Ghoul clan enslaving the ghouls as its minions.<br/><br/>The Party located in the Home Counties, come across a news heading in the Plymouth Evening Herald \u201cWar Veteran Eats Dead\u201d, the story details an Afghanistan War Veteran found dazed and confused in a cemetery with a half eaten corpse in an excavated grave.<br/><br/>The Flake carefully cuts out the clipping, crumples it, closes his eyes and eats it (Use Magic) to view the scene. The Flake sees the Veteran walking along a path in the graveyard, his view pans to a grave where he sees dirt being flung up from a grave as though being dug by a dog, but nothing is visible. Panning back to the Veteran he sees him stop in horror and confusion, the Flake feels that the Veteran can see what is causing the dirt to be flung out, but the Flake cannot.  The Flake then gags and chokes on the paper in his throat taking 1 harm. The Expert gaining the clues of \u201cinvisible\u201d and \u201ceating dead\u201d identifies the Ghouls. He then recalls a potion that can be used to see the creatures, but this requires parts of a corpse (he doesn't share this information).<br/><br/>Various information gathering rolls are then undertaken, most failing, causing a Reporter (Impulse: busybody) in Plymouth to become aware of their interest. The Expert calls the Morgue posing as a Doctor asking for details, the roll is again failed and a Detective (Impulse: detective) is now involved and nows of the Experts name.<br/><br/>The Party travel to a Travelodge near the cemetery in question and takes 3 twin rooms. They all gather in the Mundane and Chosen's (sisters) room, to discuss the details. Down the corridor they hear a banging on a door and a voice asking for the Expert \u2013 the Detective has arrived looking for the Expert (who had used his real name when enquiring at the Morgue and booking in at the Travelodge). Realising that their door might be knocked on next, the Chosen quickly gets undressed to a towel, turns on the shower and wets herself down. She then exits the bathroom and ushers in the four men. With just the two ladies in the room, the Detective is flustered when he has the door answered by a half naked lady, with her \u201cgirlfriend\u201d caressing her from behind.  He quickly leaves.  The Hard Case attempts to follow, as the Detective leaves in his car, but is noticed by the Detective who takes a good look at his face and van registration number.<br/><br/>The Veteran is being held in custody at the Devonport Naval Base. The Mundane acting as a Legal Aid visits the Dockyard with the Expert (again acting as a Doctor) in tow. Managing to dupe the dockyard security, the Mundane manages to meet with the Veteran and explains that she believes he saw a Ghoul. He explains that he was visiting a comrade who had been brought back from Afghanistan when he sighted the creature. When pushed about the subject and his time in Afghanistan the Veteran's mental state deteriorates and he asks the two to leave. (He had been captured by Mujahideen, tortured and forced to eaten a fallen comrade \u2013 hence he could see the ghouls). Before the two leave, the Veteran agrees to take the legal aid of the Mundane, signing the appropriate papers.<br/><br/>Twilight: The Nachzehrer rises. <br/><br/>Now early evening, on the way back to the Travelodge, the Mundane and Expert stop at the Police Station and ask for the Detective. Surprised to see the Mundane again, he nevertheless agrees to the request to hand over the case files, but wont be able to do this until the next working day.<br/><br/>While this has been happening the Flake and the Wronged have been checking out the graveyard. They find the empty grave taped off with police warning tape.  Nearby is a another recent grave, the grass not yet grown back. They believe that the Ghouls might come back, so work out the best way to set up observation.  The Reporter spots them and starts asking questions, which they manage to fob off, however they take a lot longer to shake him off then they would have liked.<br/><br/>Dusk: The Nachzehrer kills the Detective in the Police Station<br/><br/>It is now getting well into the evening and the Party is discussing the case in their hotel room. They hear on the news that a Police Officer has died in the Plymouth police station.  Tuning into the Police radio bands they find out that it is the Detective and that the death is suspicious.<br/><br/>The Hard Case, Mundane and Expert travel back to the police station to a, try and find out what happened, and b, make sure that whoever was taking over the Veterans case would still make the case files available to the Mundane the next day.<br/><br/>Whilst travelling around the Bombed Out Church Roundabout (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/images/2006/06/23/bombed_church_staples_450x338.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/images/2006/06/23/bombed_church_staples_450x338.jpg</a>), the three hear the sound of bells coming from the church tower. Stopping to investigate, the three enter the church. The Nachzehrer scuttles down the church tower and launches himself at the Expert, slashing the Expert with his claws as a shotgun blasts into the Nachzehrer's chest. The Expert rolls with the blow (luck) and the claws narrowly miss instead. Unhindered by the shotgun blast the Nachzehrer turns back to the Expert, glancing at the other two. The Hard Case identifies the Nachzehrer and calls for a coin from the Mundane.  The Nachzehrer lunges at the Expert, who discards his shotgun in favour of his silver sword, hoping for a better result. Taking a another swipe from the Nachzehrer the Expert is wounded. The Mundane despite the horror in front of her obliges by tossing a coin to the Hard Case who jumps onto the back of the Nachzehrer, grasping its head and shoving the coin into its mouth.<br/><br/>The Nachzehrer slumps to the ground paralysed (weakness). The Hard Case wraps its jaw with his belt and they throw the corpse into the back of the car (the boot is too small).  The Expert and Mundane head for out of town, wanting to get away from Plymouth before they decide what to do. The Hard Case phoning the others back at the Travelodge, waits for the Wronged and the Chosen to come and collect him, whilst the Flake stays in the hotel room keeping observation on the cemetery.<br/><br/>Stopping in a lay-by the Expert gets on the phone (speakerphone conference call) and gives his location to the Hard Case, Wronged and Chosen, whilst the Flake listens in). Distracted by the conversation he fails to notice the Mundane get out of the car and quietly close the door behind her.<br/><br/>The Mundane seeing some bushes move apart then back again, outside the car window, goes to investigate (Don't Worry I'll Check It Out). Moving into the woods at the side of the lay-by, she suddenly feels arms grasp around her arms and body (Always The Victim) and gets dragged further into the woods.<br/><br/>At the same time the Expert (and the others on the other end of the Phone) hear the scream, the Expert notices the empty seat by the side of him and the closed door start to open. Shouting out the situation over the speaker phone, he grunts in pain as another set of claws slash across his chest.<br/><br/>The Flake hearing that the Mundane is missing Uses Magic to teleport the Chosen to the side of her sister. The Hard Case and Wronged are shocked as the Chosen suddenly disappears, just as they pull up into the lay-by behind the Expert.<br/><br/>The Expert Uses Magic to try and heal a wound, which instead starts to fester and boil and he passes out. Having pre armed with spray paint the Wronged jumps to the passengers door of the Experts car and sprays into the back of the car highlighting the Ghoul  removing the coin from the Nachzehrer's mouth.<br/><br/>As the Nachzehrer rises up from the back seat the Hard Case opens the drivers side door and aims his Hand Cannon over the slumped body of the Expert and blows off the Nachzehrer's head...<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the woods the Chosen, also pre-armed with spray paint, quickly recovers her composure and sprays at the Mundane who is being dragged backwards by invisible arms.  Once the Ghoul is highlighted by the paint, she quickly dispatches it.<br/><br/>A hastily written AP, before I forget too much... A very fun session enjoyed by all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356805/#Comment_356805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T16:40:59+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  4:40PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a fantastic game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
