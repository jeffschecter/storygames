So now I've got two problems:<br/><br/>- it doesn't look like it was really intended for 2 player.  If you wanted to play it two player, how would you do it?  GM + 1 player, or jigger it to be more GMless?  <br/><br/>- I can't even figure out how to play it as intended for more players.  I've searched here and The Forge, and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Provisional_Second_Rules_Draft" rel="nofollow">this</a> looks like the most up-to-date information, but it's still pretty minimal.  In particular:<br/>-- What is this "What's your Dream" card?  Am I missing it?  Is it from an earlier draft?  What did it say?  (I have all the pink cards, 20 blue character cards, 10 purple phase cards, 8 boost cards, and 1 title card - am I missing anything else?)<br/>-- Are there any examples of play anywhere?  I don't mean AP, I mean examples of conflict and using cards' special abilities.<br/>-- Are players randomly assigned their blue cards, or do they get to choose?<br/>-- How much prep does the GM do, if any?  Does she need a kicker or NPCs or is she expected to do that on the fly?<br/>-- Does the GM use blue cards for their NPCs or does everyone just keep them in their heads?<br/>-- What are the "story boosts" and "character boosts" for - who uses them, when?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!  If I get answers I'll propagate them into the wiki.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306163/#Comment_306163" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T16:07:12+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  4:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>- it doesn't look like it was really intended for 2 player.

This isn't too hard, really: in most high-school dramas, there's just one central character.\n<blockquote>I can't even figure out how to play it as intended for more players.

Be prepared to make assumptions.\n<blockquote>-- What is this "What's your Dream" card? Am I missing it? Is it from an earlier draft?</blockquote>\nProbably. I think it just says that each character should decide what their dream is and who is standing in their way.\n<blockquote>-- Are players randomly assigned their blue cards, or do they get to choose?</blockquote>\nThose are the character ones, right? They choose. That's a fun part.\n<blockquote>-- How much prep does the GM do, if any? Does she need a kicker or NPCs or is she expected to do that on the fly?</blockquote>\nDo it on the fly. I follow standard high school plots: for example, if you have a nerdy character, have a science fair.<br/><br/>Invent interesting antagonists for each PC. This is really easy. If there's a pretty PC, invent a prettier NPC. If there's a nerdy PC, invent a nerdier NPC or a love interest who's out of their league.\n<blockquote>-- Does the GM use blue cards for their NPCs or does everyone just keep them in their heads?</blockquote>\nIn their heads.<br/><br/>It's a fun game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306191/#Comment_306191" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T04:39:54+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  4:39AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bunch of people here <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Provisional_Second_Rules_Draft" rel="nofollow">rewrote Tony's rules for him.</a> Might be useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306498/#Comment_306498" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T18:17:20+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  6:17PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conflict narration seems like it could be abused.  I haven't played yet, so I don't know if it would really be a problem, maybe everyone would just be cool, but I'm imagining this worst-case scenario:<br/><br/>Player A: And I achieve my dream!<br/>Player B: (Plays 24 - Humble) No you don't, because I say something humble and it convinces you to stop.<br/>Player A: (Plays 43 - Stubborn) No it doesn't, because I'm not the sort to let anything stop me.  So I kill you and achieve my dream.<br/>Player B has no more cards:  Huh.  Guess I'm dead and the story's over.<br/><br/>Is this part of the game?  Or are there limits to conflict narration I'm missing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306499/#Comment_306499" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T18:25:13+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  6:25PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2010 7:36PM by jdfristrom.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking closer at Tony Dowler's thing, it seems I'm missing several cards:<br/><br/>* "What's your Dream?"<br/>* "Drawing"<br/>* "Stakes"<br/>* "Opinions"<br/><br/>Were these from a previous edition?<br/>Can anyone type up what they said?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
