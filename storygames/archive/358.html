                    Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This came into my head after reading <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> about the way past decisions give deeper layers of meaning to the character's choices in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of a game where the same character is played by 3-4 players. The scenes go round the table, and every scene deals with a different time in the main character's life. The character is also played (if I was not clear) by another player. So everyone (maybe except for a GM) is playing the role of say Past(xN), Present, Future(xN) of Character X. Needless to say, every such "time" has its own conflict which must be resolved in the course of one session. Yeah, I'm thinking of a 'con game. So it's like 3-4 short stories, and each takes up about an hour, played one scene at a time.<br/>
<br/>
What I think I need is:<br/>
<br/>
1. Some way(s) to generate and resolve conflict (except for extensive on-the-fly GM-weaving or the use of direct statements) during a scene that will impact following scene(s). So if past-Agran saved a local lord from raiders, this needs (at least to be able) to factor somehow into future-Agran's present conflict. Writing everything on a communal character sheet to use as bonus/penalty is what I currently came up with.<br/>
<br/>
2. Some way(s) to prevent direct statements from undoing the game's plausibility. GM veto might work in a pinch but I'd like to avoid it as I don't want the GM to become the system. I was thinking that since everything regarding the character is written on the character sheet as fact with, say, a 1-6 rating then whenever a statement is proposed that attempts to go against another one which was established previously, the opposing statement is used as a modifier to (or comes into a contest with) the proposed one.<br/>
<br/>
3. Have players that are currently not controlling the character some way to contribute during the character scene. Proposing stuff is one thing, but I want something more mechanical. Maybe every player has a char-sheet part which "belongs" to him which he can invoke any time to try and sway conflict his way? That way I think that as the game begins we have more freedom to establish stuff and as it progresses this freedom is constrained by other "known" facts. Unless we use up or strike off every "fact" as it is invoked. I am not sure what to make of this, yet.<br/>
<br/>
4. Maybe some endgame stuff. Maybe the character is measured on some cosmic scale. And when one side goes all the way up or down there is some kind of an endgame. Maybe every player decides that at his time, the character is aligned differently and at the end the scores are tallied up for some kind of a conclusion. Or maybe only the time-wise-"last" character counts, with all the decisions established beforehand driving him to an end which he can accept and act out - or rebel against it and fight to reject it. Still mulling this over.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a system that does something like this already? If not, are there techniques/systems to help me do this well? I was thinking of some kinf of a spin on <i>Polaris</i> but I am not sure I'd like my game to have that kind of atmosphere. Other stuff might work for some parts is <i>Universalis</i> (for ownership of every kind of in-game stuff), and perhaps <i>PTA</i> as well (for scene framing, issues, edges).<br/>

Jason Petrasko's "The Man That Dreamed Tomorrow", part of his "Five False Gods" RPG anthology, seems to fit the bill.<br/>

                            I've been mulling over some very similar issues in <a href="http://neitherworldstories.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>. My focus, though, has been on enabling simultaneous joint ownership of a single character by multiple players. I think that I've stumbled upon a way to do this through assigning each player a different, potentially conflicting, agenda and enabling players to use their agendas to influence whichever player has primary narrative control of the character at any given point.<br><br>I'm still working on it.<br><br>Some version of this might work for your purposes, though.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            MarK -- what if you allow all the players to add authority tools (stats) to the character sheets?  If you're playing down-time from somebody, you add History -- so if I defeat the Warlord in the year 1200, the guy playing in 1210 adds "Defeated the Warlord."  If you're playing up-time from somebody, you add Destiny -- so the guy playing in 1190 adds "Will defeat the Warlord."  Thereafter everybody gets to live up to their Destinies and Histories by rolling extra dice for what the other players did.                        </div>

                            Building on Joshua's idea:<br>
<br>
While the current PC is in a conflict, the players of a previous incarnation can initiate a flashback scene, wherein the PC encounters a conflict and learns something.  If he wins the flashback conflict, he gets a positive trait to use in the baseline conflict.  If he fails, hen he has a flaw affecting the current conflict.  This would give the players of inactive timeframes some sort of input, by starting scenes and affecting the character/outcome of a conflict.                        </br></br></div>

                            droog: Thanks for reminding me of that one. Seems that multiple players for one character is possible (even if not the way I envision it) by group concensus. For that, the "character" must be "clear" to everyone as much as possible so that all play decisions will "click". However this does bring to mind the issue of character "ownership". Where I come from, people are big on immersion or at least character-as-only-vehicle-for-expression. I'm not sure they'd buy group play such as this. &lt;/digression&gt; Question is - will they buy into my idea.<br/>
<br/>
Joao: Thanks! Not exactly what I had in mind, but I'll definitely take a deeper look into this system, especially vis-a-vis items 1&amp;3 in my original post.<br/>
<br/>
szilard: Watching with interest, I am. Actually, much to my surprise, I'm quite sold. I never played Changeling, but I'd sure as hell play this one.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua &amp; Nick (can I call you Nick?): Ooo yes, Me Like! So, whatever the History/Destiny says (Flashback/Premonition?) will 100% happen in-game, with the dice determining not success/failure but degrees of impact. The Flashback/Premonition bonus/flaw is used to augment the conflict. Meaning, the warlord will be defeated no matter what, but the result of the roll determines the price involved, or the actual effect of the warlord's defeat, like this:<br/>
Success = Defeated and his armies driven across the border. Kindgom is blessed with forty years of peace.<br/>
Failure = Slain but his armies run amok and lay waste to the countryside. Kingdom reaps forty years of war and strife.<br/>
<br/>
To extrapolate on this a bit - in essence, then, every "History" scene is an extended Flashback, establishing something in the game that already happened. (The reverse is a bit trickier but easy once one gets the hang of it; "How DID I get this scar?") The difference is that History guides the conflicts, while Flashback provides narrative fuel (color?) for their resolution.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get all this into some written coherent form, pronto.<br/>
<br/>
Very excited about all this,<br/>
