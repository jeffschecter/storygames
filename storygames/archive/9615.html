One of the things he's really big on is the "Blue Ocean Strategy", which as I understand it refers to business stuff that expands into new territory (blue oceans) rather than competing for a share of existing territory (red oceans). The first example the book gives is how Cirque de Soleil (or however you spell it) stepped into a declining industry (circuses) and turned them around by chucking out some things (animals, multiple rings, catering to children) and bringing in others (musical scores, storylines, etc.).<br/><br/>Anyway, marketing jargon aside, the thread about the Sword World 2.0 DS cartridge, and <a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=422" rel="nofollow">this thread on The RPG Haven</a> about how to reach out to the mainstream, got me thinking about how to challenge the conventional wisdom in RPGs. This kind of stuff gets talked about every now and then in these parts, and I basically want to discuss the most off-the-wall, sacred-cow-slaying stuff we can come up with.<br/><br/>Why do people who know about RPGs choose not to play them? The time commitment and choice of genre are obvious things, but (for example) some of my friends have basically said they don't want too much of the creative/role-playing part. It may sound counterintuitive, but even in the existing hobby there's a segment that just wants to get in there and hack up orcs.<br/><br/>What about the medium itself? Even the most innovative RPGs are still sold as books, and generally played with sheets of paper and dice. But, an RPG could be wholly electronic, a thing you do on a website, contained in a deck of cards... Yeah.<br/><br/>How could we change the relationship between publisher and consumer?<br/><br/>How do you sum up the experience of playing an RPG in one sentence?<br/><br/>What can you get rid of to make games more useful to players?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213308/#Comment_213308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T00:37:52+00:00" title="June 19, 2009 12:37AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2009 12:54AM by komradebob.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not entirely sure you can engineer a Blue Ocean Strategy, and ( after being challenged by someone in the original RPGnet thread on insular design on this point), I'm starting to conclude that there is no Blue Ocean Strategy at all for RPGs.<br/><br/>OTOH, you might be able to bumble into a Blue Ocean situation with an activity that is fun, possibly even addictive, that has elements of RPGs, and then discover a way to make cash off it, if that is (or becomes) your goal.<br/><br/>Here's my thinking:<br/>People are lazy.<br/>People have little free time.<br/>Peope enjoy getting together with their friends for social occasions, like a party.<br/>People enjoy light competition, but not serious competition.<br/>People enjoy engaging with common cultural touchstones (liked a shared favorite tv show, book, movie, music)<br/>People all want a bit of the spotlight, to be a star even if for only a few minutes with friends.<br/>People enjoy playing with known stuff, especially cliches/genres/tropes, whateveah.<br/><br/>(where "People" equals at least me ;-) )<br/><br/>So, let's see. If I was making a game with those things in mind, plus my baggage of being a gamer, I'd throw a party and combine it with a game. Further, I'd theme it based on a sitcom that we all knew. I'd print up pix of the actors in their roles, and put their names on them, and maybe some really quick write ups about them on the back. Then, when people chose their characters, they'd tape or pin the pic to their shirt front.<br/><br/>The game than is nothing more than playing out a hypothetical episode of that show. I'd probably start with some basic stuff ( as host, why not at least get things rolling?). I dunno, play it in "scenes", with the major mechanic being that players not in the scene could shout suggestions and the active players try to incorporate them or do their own thing while doing their best impression of the character/actor from the real show. Enter of other characters on whim into the scene, provided they give context.<br/><br/>And I'd keep the scenes short, maybe even just use a timer. We break. Everyone then breaks, drinks more, and comes up with ideas for the next scene and turns them in. Short stuff, like on a 3x 5 card. Hand em into someone, who then picks one or more and sets up the next scene with what has already happened in mind. <br/><br/>Repeat process a few times. Drink more. End that sucker, and wind down the "themed part" of the evening's activity. Go drink.<br/><br/>A few minutes after the cool down, give some sort of recognition by popular acclaim. Rounds of applause.<br/><br/>More Drinking.<br/><br/>Now, before everyone is totally smashed, the host gets attention of party-goers, and challenges someone else to throw the next shindig in a similar vein.<br/><br/>Taaa-daa! There, now you have the basis for a game for the masses. Go ye forth and steal from <i>Friends</i> and <i>Seinfeld </i>and <i>'Allo, 'Allo</i>.<br/><br/><b>Where's the money?</b> <br/>I dunno. Make it a fad. Sell crap to make it easier to play:series guides, cool screen shots of the actors, episode starter sheets and decks of idea cards gearded towards a particular show.<br/> <br/>Host the game at a bar you own or work at and rake in tips ( hell, it works for Pub Quiz nights and midnight shows of Rocky Horror), host it as a party at the same venue that hosts cheesy stand up nights and get the audience involved, switching player-to-role with audience members ( get free drinks or food or a cut from the door), whatever.<br/><br/>Or, make up your own never-made sitcom and your your own fad. Hook up with a decent cartoonist and put up a website. Let people play the sitcom characters with their own local group and record it, turn it in in some fashion. Then pick the episode you like best that was turned in, get the artist to draw it up, and it becomes part of the building canon. When you start getting a lot of hits, sell advert space. ( Come to think of it, you could almost do something similar with <i>Lady Blackbird</i>. Hmmm) <br/><br/>Is it roleplaying? Sure. Storygaming? Mebbe. A game? Well, there'd be competition and social recognition and a bit of structure, so I'd call it one.<br/><br/>Would it call the masses into the Red Ocean of RPGs?<br/><br/>Doubt it, but really who cares if a bunch of folks are having fun with it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213327/#Comment_213327" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T06:21:49+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  6:21AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think blue ocean strategy is viable to any market take for example MMO's I play with my friends do stuff get stuff in return and then compare with my friends.

So... what's the most recent innovation in "RPGs" that had a shot at mainstream? The Murder Mystery Dinner Party games. THERE'S some of your hook. But most of them lack any real "role playing" or even creativity: you mill about reading off cards to each other until someone figures out which way the railroad is heading and guesses the murderer. We disdain the in the LARP RPG.net forum, even as we jealously look on at their shelf presence in WalMarts and Toys R Us.<br/><br/>And you are wise to take into account media. The DVD has a GREAT interface tool for the masses, and it can easily be used as a springboard for a game. And it's easier to get folks to watch a DVD for 30 minutes than to read 100 pages of rules text, that's for sure. Get 'em showing off their $1000 flatscreen TVs to the Joneses, and you have a "social" activity (as the wise man said: "demented and sad, but social").<br/><br/>Robert's got a good line on the generalities: people are lazy, fearful of the new, and wanting to lord over others. Mostly. In America, at least. So forget about crunch, radical innovations, and collaboration. Bring World of Warcraft (et al) to the coffee or kitchen table and call it a day and head for the bank.<br/><br/>We are, let's face it, a rare and creative breed. Artists, in a nutshell.

The population of people who don't play RPG's vastly outnumbers the population of people who do. That alone means that a Blue Ocean Strategy could easily exist.<br/><br/>I think the reasons why RPG's haven't gotten mass appeal has a lot to do with their history, emerging from wargaming. Most RPG's to this day have a lot of crunch. As my wife has described her experience with D&amp;D 3.5, "Yeah, math homework\u2014totally my idea of a fun night out."<br/><br/>I think a lot of story games already have the potential to compete with Monopoly, rather than simply gazing up at the starry sky set by a small fry like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Traditional RPG's limit themselves to a very nerdy subset: the kinds of people who enjoy volumes of inscrutable details, and looking up tables for hit locations and damage dealt. I think simple, immersive games could really make a hit.<br/><br/>Why haven't they?<br/><br/>On the one hand, I think a certain amount of the blame has to fall on us, the people who play and design story games. We've suffered from a lack of ambition. We've accepted that as indie gamers, we'll always have just a fringe of the fringe market of RPG's in general, itself a fringe of gaming in general. So, we've concentrated on trying to pitch to other gamers. But gamers have self-selected themselves already for the kinds of people who enjoy volumes of inscrutable details, and looking up tables for hit locations and damage dealt. So, we've concentrated on pitching to an audience self-selected to <em>not want what we have to offer</em>!<br/><br/>I once had a very traditional gamer tell me that the fact that most gamers didn't like indie games proved that they had a very limited appeal. I pointed out that the very things that made them unappealing to a traditional gamer like him\u2014the player empowerment, the light rules, even the simple fact that you've got so many games that deal with real-world situations instead of Tolkien-esque fantasy\u2014made them <em>more</em> appealing to the general population. Think of how many times you may have experienced, or have heard accounts from others, how non-gamers quickly and easily pick up story games, much more quickly and much more easily than gamers who have so many assumptions to set aside and rules to unlearn.<br/><br/>The other big hurdle I see might pose a bigger challenge than just re-orienting your marketing, but I consider it one of the things that makes storyjamming so valuable. Americans have become increasingly more socially isolated (<a href="http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/June06ASRFeature.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a>). Wizards of the Coast has frequently discussed its sales difficulties in terms of groups that break up, and the difficulties of getting a play group together. Not just play groups\u2014groups of any kind have gotten more and more difficult to bring together. Modernity isolates us in so many ways. That isolation makes it very difficult for any face-to-face activity to gain a foothold. It takes so much effort to get your friends together; simply watching TV and submitting to the growing isolation seems so much easier. But story games provide one more tool, one more means, one more reason for people to get together, and that means that each and every story game published offers a little rallying cry against that growing isolation. I have to admit, I really look forward to making some money one day, however little, at a business that can look at social isolation as bad for business, and can put some marketing dollars to helping address it.<br/><br/>So, when I finally do finish <em>The Fifth World</em>, I probably will hit some of the cons, but I won't put my emphasis there. No, I intend to really push my marketing dollars touring co-housing communities, intentional communities, and ecovillages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213701/#Comment_213701" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T07:20:04+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  7:20AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I potentially great move for story games to take could be a more familiar (to the non gamer) look; take http://www.hamsterpress.net/news/list these are micro games that include familiar things rules, playing pieces, tokens, player cards, and most importantly a board.

Consider also the success of Anne Rice/vampire lit in the 90's. The interest in the supernatural and vampires in particular might be a better predictor than Gothyness/the quest for story games. Vampires as literature and a fandom seem pretty healthy even before the game (thus you get things like count chococula and the count from seseme street because vampires as a whole have a blip on the public radar) and walking into a bookstore now, you can generally still find a half a dozen new vampire novels...<br/><br/>As for the world is my oyster people, power to you.

It's quite possibly an order of magnitude larger than tabletop RPGs--and some of them get very elaborate--but there's scarcely any overlap between them. That's where a lot of that kind of energy with regard to existing franchises from TV and other popular media goes.<br/><br/>This kind of role-play is different from typical tabletop because it's about enjoying a convincing imitation of a character from an existing property, without the same kind of creativity or character dynamism that we're used to. You want your Harry Potter to be a damn good Harry Potter like in the books, and not to become something else.<br/><br/>The question is, what can we learn from this other hobby scene? And from a business/design standpoint, what could someone offer that would be better than forums, AIM, IRC, etc.?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213712/#Comment_213712" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T08:54:12+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  8:54AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my opinion, rpgs based on existing licenses can be interesting in terms of exploring parts of the franchice world that you can't otherwise explore. <br/>To use Dresden Files as an example (although I've only read one of the books), I can see it appealing to non-gamers if explained to them in the ''right way''. Like any product, you have to appeal to what interests them.  A Dresden Files rpg for a non-gamer is a continuation of the novels (maybe it should involve new plotlines or hooks?), it means you can play a game based on one of the lesser-used characters in the book (play a vampire or an evil warlock), explore new locations that haven't been touched upon in the book, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213713/#Comment_213713" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T08:56:03+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  8:56AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a minor personal comment about the success of VtM.<br/><br/>I started with rpgs with D&amp;D in about 1980-81 when I was around ten years old. By the time Vamp hit, I was already into the goth and punk scene and just barely out of college. What Vamp was was an RPG that I could play with the folks I was already hanging out with, so I could get my Vamp-friendly punk pals together with my gamer pals.<br/><br/>I'm not sure VtM really did reach out to non-gamers by itself. Rather, there were a bunch of Boxed Set Gen gamers who were into the subculture too, who then grabbed non-gamers and drew them in which was easy due to the nature of VtM. <br/><br/>Aside from that, there seems to be some fairly muddled thinking going on, at least as a group.

I'm much more focused on how it mike make for neat games than the practical business side of things. (But, I've never subscribed to the idea that the OP should control what goes on in a thread.) So, let's go over some of the points from the book:<br/><br/>According to the book, a blue ocean strategy should do the following in varying proportions:<br/>Create something that's never been offered before.<br/>Raise something well above the industry standard.<br/>Eliminate something that's taken for granted.<br/>Reduce something well below the industry standard.<br/><br/>The major ways is gives to arrive at this are to:<br/>1. Look at how things are done in other areas entirely.<br/>2. Look at how things are done in a different sector of the same area (e.g., looking to economy cars for ways to make better luxury cars).<br/>3. Look across the chain of buyers (e.g., Evil Hat's PDF policy pays attention to the retailer as well as the end customer)<br/>4. Look at complementary products/services, other things that can affect how people use the main thing (e.g., having child care at a movie theater)<br/>5. Shift the focus between functional and emotional appeal to buyers.<br/>6. Examine trends over time.<br/>7. Analyze why non-customers are non-customers. (Put off by something, want to but can't, or no one's bothers to try selling to them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213718/#Comment_213718" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T09:56:30+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  9:56AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Reduce something well below the industry standard.</blockquote>\nCould you tell me a bit about this point? <i>Reduce</i> in what sorts of ways?<br/><br/>(Because I think this is where I am...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213731/#Comment_213731" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T11:37:55+00:00" title="June 21, 2009 11:37AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Tail_(wine)" rel="nofollow">Yellow Tail wine</a> is perhaps a good example of a product using the Reduce part well.

When launching Yellow Tail, Casella basically cut the selection down to two kinds (red and white), put them in the same kind of bottle (which simplified sales displays too), and made the flavor simpler, milder, and more accessible. In essence they made wine's answer to sweeter, more casual alcoholic beverages, and it was a major success.<br/><br/>For a gaming example, Palladium Books was in certain ways a very innovative company back in the day. One of the important things that Kevin Simbieda did was to defy the conventional wisdom and put out all of Palladium's games as well-made but inexpensive softcover books, at a time when more expensive hardcovers or boxed sets were the norm. While we can question the quality in some ways, for the volume of material they include, Palladium's books were and in fact <i>still are</i> priced very cheaply compared to other publishers putting out comparably sized books. Rifts Ultimate is $36, and they have a bunch of other zany games (Dead Reign, Nightbane, After the Bomb, etc.) for $25 or less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214228/#Comment_214228" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T13:56:09+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  1:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>I don't think any other publisher had really tried making tabletop and LARP versions of the same franchise, and I'm pretty sure none of the ones that did (wasn't there an L5R LARP?) were as successful about it.</blockquote>Cthulhu Live does OK at cons I attend. Has for years (like, decades). But, yes, they are few and far between. I think it's because the Big Dollar RPG makers know full well that LARPs are very firm "Not Invented Here" adherents.<br/><br/>That said... my GLASS is basically HERO LARP, pared down for simplicity (i.e. handling speed) and verisimilitude (i.e. avoiding the ridiculous).<br/><br/>I'm surprised SJG hasn't done a GURP conversion supplement for LARPing, though--it wouldn't be too tough, either boffer or non-contact (or even either); and it's not like SJ doesn't print product (and derivative product) as fast as it's typed.<br/>-----<br/>I think CCGs found some Blue Ocean, in their infancy: you combined the "chase card" addiction of sports cards with the strategy of miniature army building (but not the cost... originally) and the tactics of a complex board game. I think that's what's prompting some folks in this thread to mention ideas with 'common playing pieces" and "boards"--trying to enter the mindspace and markets of folks who, for instance, play German board games or poker (err, more like Axis and Allies, let's say). Ditto with the IP tie-ins: "You watched every episode of Friends, NOW PLAY THE GAME!" (I'd argue that it's a Blue Lagoon to do tie-ins from genre fiction.)<br/><br/>In fact, a strong product to look at is Long Live the King: part board game, part Diplomacy, part LARP/Host a Murder Mystery; each part of which can be dialed up or down by the individual participants. You can play it totally out of character, you can dress the part and use baroque language; you can try to be a Machiavelli of Manipulation, or you can mimic Survivor-level allegiances and, ultimately, backstabs. I don't think it's doing all THAT well, but I bet (a) it's on shelves that non-RPGers check in a game/comic store and (b) it's gotten at least a few new customers into the LARP space that never heard of WW's MET.<br/><br/>OK, so you want to know the Killer App, then? It's what 17% of the Internet is devoted to (last I heard the stats): porn. Come up with a "role playing" game for couples (and their consenting friends!) and you've got a money-maker that will go right into Adam &amp; Eve's Top Sellers line up! Not some shitty truth-or-dare rip-off like in Spenser's. Something that is "played" over the course of a night out, dancing, and eventual tumble into bed/the kitchen table/the shower.

I'm all about loyalty to the FLGS (if they're model is smart enough to stay competitive, like Sci Fi Genre's is), but I know of at least one game manufacturer who will ONLY sell through FLGSs, even though their products would FLY off the shelves of Big Box toy and department stores. We've even BEGGED them to release a game or two into those mainstream markets, as a sort of "breadcrumb"" to lead them (via literature in the game's contents) to their site and, by extension, preferred retailers. I'm not sure they'd even consider marketing in "specialty" toy shops like Discovery Kids or ... or... DMAN, whatsistsname. The "fancy toy store" where most everything is made in the US (or Germany) and is all about "learning," without any toy guns or video games or shit.

You market to people who enjoy products like yours and the people who WOULD like your product if they were made aware of it.  You do not try and sell games to people who don't play games, you try and make people who would like to play your game, but have not yet played similar games, aware of and attracted to your game.<br/><br/>The absolute best thing to remember is that in your quest to add new potential owners from this frontier population, you must continue to cultivate the core demographic you appeal to.  They are the people most likely to buy your product without the marketing push, so (whether the marketing beyond the product is designed for them), the product should on some level be made for them.<br/><br/>Best example of this I have seen lately is "Penny for My Thoughts".  The game is able to target indie gamers, actors and fans of improv games, and potentially even educators.  There is some material contained in the back of the book to keep the game anchored to more traditional "geeky subjects" and I think Paul deals with that tendency in the OOC part of the book.  His talk about Gonzo play and establishing the parameters (not limits, per se) of the reality the characters are within.<br/><br/>No doubt, if you gave the game to a set of acting students and a group of sci-fi writers at a Conevention, you would get VERY different games, but both sides would be having FUN and consumers from both groups would want to take it home after the test drive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214272/#Comment_214272" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T19:32:12+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  7:32PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same person that runs Eden runs Zombie Planet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214334/#Comment_214334" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T09:54:55+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  9:54AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Neko, would you consider that a BOS?

I'm trying to think of something that used a comparable "piggybacking" strategy. I've seen simple board games and such in magazines and books on rare occasions (Animerica once had a rather nifty Ranma 1/2 board game, actually), and Dream Pod 9's Project A-ko RPG had an A-ko card game--nothing to do with the RPG--stuck in the back. I could see short games with literary style appearing in Sweeney's or New Yorker, simple anime-inspired games in Otaku USA, that kind of thing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>'Course, that undercutrs the whole indie conecpt of creator control for the game itself, so maybe that's it.</blockquote>\nThe creator control thing in the indie RPG scene serves a definite purpose, but it's decidedly not for everything or everyone.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>I think what the comic is saying is correct, you don't market to people who will not like your product.

While there's some stuff intrinsic to RPGs that make them difficult for many people to play (mainly the logistics of getting a bunch of people together on a regular basis), that so many people just plain don't know about them is the much bigger obstacle, and doubly so when it comes to indie RPGs, or anything that isn't D&amp;D, really. When someone asks you what you're doing on Friday night and they have no idea what an RPG is, it's tempting to say "They're stuff like D&amp;D", but we have a heck of a lot of games that, apart from being RPGs, are nothing like D&amp;D, and could appeal to a lot of people who'd be put off by D&amp;D for one reason or another.<br/><br/>Hence, "marketing innovation" is a big and important hurdle. The piggybacking approach for example could not only put a game in lots of people's hands, but raise awareness of what the heck an RPG is among the people who pick up whatever it is that's being piggybacked on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214341/#Comment_214341" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T10:35:59+00:00" title="June 25, 2009 10:35AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This kind of thinking is a big part of why I've been thinking for awhile that what I'd love to see in this "industry" are Agents.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Agents.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeoples whose job it is to have the connections and network to make the above sort of ideas happen.

(I hear the average book is pitched for about fifteen seconds--you GOTTA have a superior blurb to get the retail buyers to listen tot he two-minute brief.)<br/><br/>So, yeah, maybe those folks DON'T exist for "our niche" because they're already flooded with the genre fiction, mainstream RPG products, cook books, romance novels, or whatever else they have specialized in (and some, I'd reckon, are even publisher-specific).<br/><br/>Hmm..... tech writing is getting very dull, of a sudden....                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214361/#Comment_214361" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T12:26:51+00:00" title="June 25, 2009 12:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree it'll likely happen the other way - some other industry/group/subculture/whatever latching onto roleplaying as an extension of their own thing.  <br/><br/>MGM/UA talked to me about writing a game tie-in for <i>Valkyrie</i>; the deal fell through, but as a marketing tool for their movie they saw the potential.

And possibly somewhat later, someone will do this and it will be a commercial success. :-}<br/><br/>One thing to look at is how game consoles and computer games have broken out of their ghettoes and attracted "non-gamers".<br/><br/>The Wii attracted people who weren't console gamers because they took a new approach to content and made the games fun and accessible to non-geeks who didn't want to sit for hours and kill things by pushing buttons.<br/><br/>And both "casual" PC gaming and things like iPhone games attract a wide audience by similar strategies - easy to pick up and put down, you can do a level really quickly, and they often have some kind of ordinary-life thing going on as a theme. I was watching my wife play a game on her iPod Touch last night that, I swear, was the Martha Stewart game.

They broke out of the harder/better/faster/stronger arms race of more powerful consoles that Microsoft and Sony had put themselves into trying to please hardcore gamers, and innovated in the interface and experience while keeping the price low and the profit margin relatively high.<br/><br/>Imagine you're introducing someone to video games who's never considered playing one before. You can hand them an Xbox or PlayStation controller, which has 10 buttons and 3 directional controls, or you can give them Wii controller that looks like a remote control and say, "Just swing this like you're holding a tennis racket." And as for the DS, in Japan they couldn't keep up with demand at all for a while, and it's got a strong following among not only gamers but adults who use it for both casual games and more practical stuff. There are DS cartridges with recipe collections, literature, language lessons, phrasebooks, dictionaries... it goes on and on, into areas that neither the Game Boy nor the PSP ever dreamed of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214437/#Comment_214437" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T19:54:00+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  7:54PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I saw a very telling piece of marketing at my local mall recently - a big poster advertising the DS, showing a woman in her late 50s or early 60s using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214467/#Comment_214467" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T00:40:54+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:40AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2009 12:43AM by Number6intheVillage.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that everybody who wants to play rpgs already plays them.

Hence, one of the most successful licensed RPGs was <i>Buffy: The Vampire Slayer</i>. I remember seeing a copy of the <i>Serenity</i> RPG in a comic book shop that one time, but I don't know that anyone has really had the resources to make non-gamer fans aware of the RPG adaptations. The WWE has licensed CCGs and RPGs on occasion, but while they're entirely too happy to pimp every bit of merchandise imaginable, AFAIK none of the table games have ever appeared on their website, much less been mentioned even briefly in the 6+ hours of programming they put out every single week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214543/#Comment_214543" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T09:16:26+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  9:16AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, as for mind-set, the core activity of RPGs is actually pretty easy: Play Pretend + some rules/structure making it a bit more like a game ( what type of game being a bit trickier to describe usually).<br/><br/>What Number6inthevillage seems to be getting at is more like,erm, getting folks to go from exposed to the <i>Play Pretend+...</i> concept to being full-on, long-term gamers. To me, that's where part of the disconnect occurs.<br/><br/>Getting the PP+ concept out there simply requires a different approach. It may not be a real big money earner either ( although I'm sure some smarter monkey than myself could figure that out).<br/><br/>Again, I think some of this comes down to "What do <b>you </b> want out of a new BOS approach to RPGs?"<br/><br/>For me, it's the exposure of a wider audience to PP+ game/activity concepts. I couldn't really care if any number later became so enthusiastic about PP+ or RPGs or SGs that they became hard-core hobbyists or designers.<br/><br/>As for mechanical or presentation innovation ( which seems to be Neko's main interest), starting from "Who is my target audience and what do I know or suspect about them?" is probably a good place to begin. Thinking about it outsdie of monetary gain might also be a good idea, although using your imagination to posit some distribution <b>not </b>based on the indie designer-retains-control model might be a key here as well. While an awesome and awe-inspring idea for getting out your self-published project to like-minded hobbyists, it does let designers off the hook where it comes to accessibility to a wider audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214628/#Comment_214628" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T19:41:11+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  7:41PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2009 7:43PM by DanielSolis.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, someone's gotta have an idea of how to use this kind of technology:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNu4CluFOcw" rel="nofollow">Ahhhrrrr: Augmented Reality Shooter</a><br/><br/>My first thought is that you literally throw dice at monsters on the table.

I think most people <em>desperately</em> want to pretend. They <em>yearn</em> to pretend. They want to pretend like nothing else and can feel the life drained out of them, drop by drop, dying by degrees every day that they <em>don't</em> pretend. But they also feel exhausted by the time they get home from work, and don't think they have the energy to pretend. On top of that, they buy the line that pretend just means kid's play, that adults don't pretend.<br/><br/>But I also think that like dancing, singing, or any other participatory folk art I can think of, you feel kind of silly when you start, like everyone's watching you, but eventually you figure out that everyone really has more interesting things to do than to watch you, and you've just got to get over that. I think of the person who feels uncomfortable about roleplaying because it seems silly very much like the person who feels awkward about getting up on the dance floor, or doing karaoke.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214777/#Comment_214777" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T20:51:48+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  8:51PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Number6intheVillage</cite>Most people don't want to Pretend - or more accurately, deny how much pretending they do in everyday life.

These odd-looking things inspire a little curiosity, to which I respond with an unapologetic, straightforward explanation of what I do in that particular hobby and why I like it.<br/><br/>People usually get it. I might describe my Monday night game as follows:<br/><br/> "A bunch of us get together with snacks and drinks and invent some fictional characters, like you might see in a SciFi television series. Then we all make up a story where each person pretends to be one character, and one of us has the job of coming up with dramatic events and other people that the characters have to deal with. Everybody has a bit of fun pretending to be this character, cooperating to solve problems, and finding out how the story ends."<br/><br/>And how do my colleagues, who are all bankers (and not a stereotypically creative profession!) respond to this? "Wow, that sounds like fun." They might not want to participate <i>themselves</i> (there's no way to accurately describe gaming without dealing with the considerable time investment usually involved) but I don't hear negative responses. I just don't.<br/><br/>And that tells me that the typical person I work with <i>does</i> see value in Playing Pretend, if it is presented to them as a fun and non-stigmatised activity. We don't idolise movie stars just because they're rich, but because they're glamourous and exciting. A story game that featured movie stars, high production quality, and was integrated into a social activity (just as How To Host A Murder is integrated into dinner parties) could have appeal as a gateway gaming experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214818/#Comment_214818" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T09:21:48+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  9:21AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, having asked a lot of my non-gamer friends what keeps them away from RPGs, there were <i>some</i> who said they don't care for the "let's pretend" aspect, at least as it's presented in RPGs. I don't think everyone has an unfulfilled hunger to pretend and create residing within, but there are definitely more people who are sufficiently creatively inclined to enjoy playing RPGs than there are existing RPG players. For some people a game like D&amp;D4e, where you can dial the creative aspects back some, are a better fit, while for other people would do better a game like PTA where the creative part is the main thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to other stuff:<br/><br/>As a little side-project, I started working on a simple card-based fantasy RPG, tentatively titled "Dragon Oracle". When I posted about this on LiveJournal, I was informed that there was in fact a CCG/RPG hybrid (different from what I'm trying to do, but still really neat), <a href="http://www.dragonstorm.com/" rel="nofollow">Dragon Storm</a>. This game originally came out in like 1997, and it's apparently still going, and the creators are making new material and doing lots of convention appearances (mostly local) to this day. I don't know how much of a commercial success it was, but not many games stay around for 12+ years no matter what.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214819/#Comment_214819" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T09:24:11+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  9:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>So, having asked a lot of my non-gamer friends what keeps them away from RPGs, there were<i>some</i>who said they don't care for the "let's pretend" aspect, at least as it's presented in RPGs..</blockquote>\nCan you tell me a it more about this response (since I've run into similar responses before as well)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214825/#Comment_214825" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T09:44:32+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  9:44AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two of my friends are potentially interested in other kinds of games with RPG aspects--one played CCGs like L5R and Doomtown a lot, and the other is more of a computer gamer, but sounded like the tactical side of 4e appealed to him--who basically said they don't like doing that kind of creativity in a large group.<br/><br/>Another friend, although a creative person in general, said he just has trouble taking RPGs seriously in play.

It just plain strikes me as an easy barrier-lowering format.<br/><br/>I suppose a person could just keep making that sort of thing and tossing it out there to see which ones stick, and only then building out from that.<br/><br/>Edit:Hmm. I'd think that a "training excersise" would be pretty easy to build, especially for the core activities common in RPGs. I doubt it would be much of a game in itself, but it would certainly get total beginners who were curious over the initial hump, before barraging them with vastly more detailed games.<br/><br/>I would probably be torn between the GM or No GM options, though. Certainly it seems like some GM training would be a good idea. Maybe a series of short situations with instructions for both the GM and character players, meant to be played in just a few ( like ten) minutes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215007/#Comment_215007" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T06:50:00+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  6:50AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My girlfriend isn't much interested in RPGs.<br/><br/>However, to watch the way that she plays Battlestar Galactica: the board game, you'd never know it.<br/><br/>I'm considering what avenues I could take from BSG to get Kaytee to actually try a story game and enjoy it.

For those folks, I think the trick is to emphasize the game over the role-playing, without totally discarding opportunities for the latter. Different gamers already like the role-playing and game parts in differing proportions, from freeform with an occasional die roll added, to a tactical minis game with some role-playing elements. As James' girlfriend has apparently demonstrated, even games without explicit RP elements can bring it out in people, and even if it doesn't, as long as it's fun as a game, they're still coming out ahead.<br/><br/>Has anyone here used, say, Talisman or HeroQuest as a stepping stone to D&amp;D or similar?

Absolutely - not for very long, but comparable to a very mechanically-focused player in campaigns I've played with D&amp;D, for example.<br/><br/>Making suboptimal choices? Certainly not deliberately so, but she certainly chooses her role as a character rather than a playing piece, and tries to make choices in-character for that role.<br/><br/>(I know <i>plenty</i> of roleplayers who baulk at making suboptimal choices.)<br/><br/>Kaytee doesn't get into character portrayal or motivations as much as folks did when we were playing Wraith, but that was a very character-focused narrative.

I see a parallel with manga (but less the manga targeted at boys and men - shonen/seinen - than the ones targeted at girls and women - shojo/josei).<br/><br/>I think you could get away with dice if you don't geek out about it, just as you can get away with power bars and controls to mash if that's not the main focus of the game.

For one thing, you can buy them anywhere, and you're likely to already have some in the house.<br/><br/>There are too many competitions running at the moment, and I don't have time to run one anyway. But here's a thought for the backburner: A competition to design a "crossover" storygame. Must be recognisably a storygame by some reasonable definition ("a game that produces story" would work for me), and must be playtested on a group that, apart from the designer, is made up of people who don't usually play tabletop RPGs. Feedback from the group ("Was it fun? Would you play this again?") is part of the judging criteria.<br/><br/>I'd suggest GM-less, too, but then, I always do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9615/blue-ocean-strategies-and-rpgs" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9615/blue-ocean-strategies-and-rpgs" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9615/blue-ocean-strategies-and-rpgs/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9615%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9615%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
