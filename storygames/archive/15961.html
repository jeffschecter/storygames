There was a lot of railroading and guessing what players wanted, even when the players would say what they wanted, things still went awry. BITs were the perfect tool for GM + player collaboration and communication, and we loved it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363310/#Comment_363310" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T07:40:32+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  7:40AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One winter in college, I discovered Continuum, Fudge, Nobilis, and the Forge all at roughly the same.

The first time I had a setting I was invested in and wanted to "get right", as opposed to playing a roleplaying game in which the setting is simply there. I still haven't found any other setting that I didn't just see as a tool or colour palette to draw from.<br/><br/><b>InSpectres</b><br/>The first game to introduce me to the difference between what I want to happen and what the character wants to happen. Later games would make this distinction more obvious to me when other players I played with were frustrated and annoyed by the way things turned out for their characters.<br/><br/><b>Buffy - The Vampire Slayer: The Watch House</b><br/>This was a game I played in when I spent a year in Edinburgh. As the game went on it became more experimental (with 2 of us often involved in pre-planning games with the GM) but it also changed my expectations of what kind of emotional response a roleplaying game could get out of me. <br/><br/><b>Primetime Adventures</b><br/>A game in which the emotional journey of a character is actually relevant to the game, as opposed to something for the player to fantasise about at home.<br/><br/><b>Paranoia</b><br/>For seperating the different roles the GM plays by actually giving them different character/voices. As a Paranoia GM you have to be impartial as the referee, malicious as the game-world and friendly and jovial as the game's host.

For me no other game has ever come anywhere close, and if you want to have random chargen, as far as I'm concerned it'd better be at least as interesting as Maid's ability to spit out a sexy heroine chainsaw-wielding cyborg fox spirit with a dark past who's working as a maid for bridal training.

In particular, reducing all of the "gold piece accounting" with Resources, the streamlined skill roles, the life paths, beliefs; and even the Duel of Wits, which was not something I had seen done well before.<br/><br/>When I got back to work on Monday, said co-worker directed me to The Forge, and I dropped down the wormhole...never to return the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363489/#Comment_363489" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T13:56:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  1:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Marvel Super Heroes: Advanced Set</b> taught me you could keep "playing pretend," only now with dice and rules arbitrating the fiction.<br/><b>Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game</b> introduced the idea of having to roll only once to hit and do damage (allowing fighting to be about the description of the fight, rather than the roll-a-thon)<br/><b>RIFTS</b> taught me that, heck, most of the RPG business is not about great game design, but about selling books to committed customers.<br/><b>AD&amp;D</b> showed me how you convinced most adult men to role-play at all... albeit badly and with a whole lot of uninteresting meta-game baggage.<br/><b>Amber</b> taught me how characters acquire depth and complexity.<br/><b>It Came from the Late, Late, Late Show</b> taught me how superficial characters and genre-loving GMs can make for a memorable combo.<br/><b>Everway</b> hinted at the rules of fiction being more important than the rules themselves.<br/><b>Unknown Armies</b> gave me the gut feeling for what a "story game" should accomplish.

Clean, elegant, easy to grasp system. Focus on game-flow and narrative rather than events. One of my favourite games ever for improvised one-shots.<br/><br/>- <b>Vampire</b><br/><br/>I've ranted extensively elsewhere about it, but started my almost fetishistic relationship to character sheets - that belief that, from a design standpoint, one look at its character sheet should be enough for a player to understand what a game is about and its basic underlying mechanics.<br/><br/>- <b>Mage: The Ascension</b><br/><br/>Meta-discussions made inherently part of the game. Also gave me my personal DM golden-rule: "If you can bullshit me, you can do it".<br/><br/>- <b>Conspiracy of Shadows</b> &amp;<b> Don't Rest you Head</b><br/><br/>Qualitative-to-quantitative transitional system, and vice-versa - what the original Storyteller had in gestation that I was actually wanting, but couldn't pinpoint up till I saw it, refined and made ready to use. The notion that some game systems should inform the particular experience they're trying to offer.\n<blockquote>Maid RPG taught me the joys of randomness in RPGs. For me no other game has ever come anywhere close, and if you want to have random chargen, as far as I'm concerned it'd better be at least as interesting as Maid's ability to spit out a sexy heroine chainsaw-wielding cyborg fox spirit with a dark past who's working as a maid for bridal training. It's kind of ridiculous how many of my own games have ended up having random tables since then.</blockquote>\nAmusingly enough, I always thought of <b>Maid</b> as AD&amp;D list-mania freed from the pretense of simulationism. And that's exactly how the DM who introduced me to AD&amp;D would run his games.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364214/#Comment_364214" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T10:31:06+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 10:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 10:42AM by johnzo.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            UserClone, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15995" rel="nofollow">I started a new thread</a> because my answer was kinda long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364373/#Comment_364373" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T17:01:37+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  5:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turles</b> - "What?" I head you say. "A Palladium system?!"  Well, yeah. As crappy as the system was, liberally stealing from D&amp;D, it made me the gamer I am. Like most of you I started with D&amp;D. An image of TMNT's Kangaroos in a Dragon magazine ad sold me on the game. Its similarity to D&amp;D made it accessible (which may not have been important). And opened me up to the idea that RPGs are a genre, and RPG does not just mean D&amp;D (not even primarily!).  Because of TMNT, I readily snapped up Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Cyborg Commandos (I know!), and other games. I hungered for variety.<br/><br/><b>Vampire: The Masquerade</b> - I avoided this when I first heard of it. It was explained to me that "blood points" were similar to "hit points" and I thought that sounded stupid (it happened to be wrong, also). The text's focus on story was eye opening (I was already doing this since blue box D&amp;D, but this took my ideas and ran with them), even if the system didn't entirely fulfill that promise ultimately. The even weight between skills of all types, and complex success system, fueled much more flexible play.<br/><br/><b>Nobilis</b> - This was a religious experience that would take too long to put into words. If I run a game for you, you may understand. Conceptually, it is the apex of RPGs. Mechanically, I have issues with both 2nd and 3rd editions that are not insurmountable, but disappointingly falls short of perfection.<br/><br/><b>Donjon</b> - I'm not sure which indie game I encountered first. It might have been Sorcerer, but that still hewed pretty close to how I ran games, even if the rules were groundbreaking. Donjon is a game I never played. A friend just showed me a 5 minute example of how it worked. My mind was blown. I knew this new style of game design was going to eclipse my gaming world and bring about a golden age.<br/><br/><b>Hero Quest, Spirit of the Century, and Fiasco</b> - I'm lumping these together because, in various ways, they delivered on that golden age promise. Of the three, I think Fiasco is the best design, and the most ground breaking. It's the first game in years that has significantly impressed me. It is a singularity that distills roleplaying into a quantum mote that I can't see how, much less why, you'd want to alter the narrative control and scene play if you just want to tell stories with friends and still be playing a game (certainly you can alter the Tilt, Resolution, and dice handling for a different style, but the general method of game set up and "Frame or Finish" scene choice, is pure). The first two however, have been very informative and influential on how I run games, no matter the system. HQ and SOTC are partly games, partly philosphies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15961/what-game-changed-your-view-about-games-and-how" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15961/what-game-changed-your-view-about-games-and-how" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15961/what-game-changed-your-view-about-games-and-how/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15961%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15961%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
