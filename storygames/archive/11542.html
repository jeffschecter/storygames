I was like, nah, the RPGs I tend to play don't usually have that problem, character creation takes ten to thirty minutes. She still seemed unsure, so Nick Marshall whipped out Ghost/Echo, and I said I'd run it even though I hadn't read it. So I read the text on the way to the men's room and back, and then I ran this 30-60 minute game, and the doubtful girl just played her Shadowrun character and everyone else improvised new characters during the process of play, and it was actually my favorite game at that con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376691/#Comment_376691" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T04:47:26+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  4:47AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing a PbF game right now.

On the sheet the GM handed me. He said he hadn't had time to read it, but he had clearly put together a long and rail-roading "kicker" introduction which started with descriptions of the Wraiths (human-headed dogs) and "who had the gun." That was dreadful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you need a third sheet for Ghost/Echo that says something like: Trust your players or which defines what a Danger is, because the GM couldn't seem to grasp that it was okay for bad things to happen to you, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGhost/Echo seems like a fun, quick game.

I'm thinking of the GM's principles in Apocalypse World in particular. Maybe something similar could be done for Ghost/Echo.

Where the rules told us that a danger remained, we passed the card with the danger written on it to the next player. This created an interesting dynamic where players began calculating dangers based on things they'd like to see happen to one another as well as being an element they were willing to risk. It also meant a sharper increase in the dice than the other method we tried (we ran two sessions in a row) where we let dangers stay in front of individual players. (That one was interesting because some players built up a huge "trail" of dangers that were constantly partially-coming true.)<br/><br/>All of this suggested an idea for a great hack to me, which is a mark of good design (that moment of clarity where you see how something works and want to build on it.)<br/>Anyway, it more than makes up for my earlier disastrous experience.<br/><br/>I might have to ammend the motto to "System does matter, at least a little, but it helps if you read the rules."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379667/#Comment_379667" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T12:06:06+00:00" title="May 24, 2012 12:06PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Where the rules told us that a danger remained, we passed the card with the danger written on it to the next player.
