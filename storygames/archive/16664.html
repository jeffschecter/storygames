The beliefs of the masses have awakened their worst nightmares in the shadows. It's going to be a rough couple of months until the skies clear, and daylight shines back on the surface of the world.<br/><br/>Where do you live? What creatures are awakened in the shadows near you?

Those who survived the initial onslaught fled along the motorways hoping to find something better but only clogged up the arterial roads with traffic.<br/><br/>Those of us on the edges of the cities simply wait for things to pass. The blood red skies of the cities glow from the savage fires that still burn weeks after the great darkening. We're thankful that we have enough home grown foods to survive for a few more days, but we dread the time when we'll have to head into the cities to see the true face of the shattered urban nightmare. <br/><br/>But maybe the cities will be safer than surviving where we are...Jacko didn't come back from his hunting trip to gather meat a few days back...and that howling seems to get louder as it echoes through the trees when the wind dies down. Some of us are thinking of gathering the cars fueled by LPG and taking to the road, the rest are thinking about barricading the town against the last refugees from the cities and the howling things from the bush.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381143/#Comment_381143" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T06:06:09+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  6:06AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, luckily enough I happened to be a part of the Enclave, a super secretive select group of scientists set up by the government who live and work in a massive underground hi-tech bunker 24 hours a days, out of a converted cold war missile silo complex. We were deep enough and shielded enough that the EMP didn't affect us too much down here.<br/><br/>The unfortunate thing is that when things went haywire topside, we were outed by the military.  At the topside hatch (which is plenty secured, the government made sure of that), a large community of rabble-rousers, destitutes, and rogue military have loosely joined together to wait us out, with the thinking that we have endless food, supplies, and shelter in here. Our rough estimates is that there's probably a total of 11,000 people out there. And growing daily. <br/><br/>While we are personally still live in creature comforts of underground living, we only have enough supplies and energy resources for those of us down here for about three months. Oxygen supplies have been even damaged more, with a combination of the falling ash sooting up the filtration grids and with the rogue military constant attempts to "smoke us open". We've come up with some clever bypasses around the system, but that still results with us only having about a month of fresh oxygen for the 18 of us.<br/><br/>We tend to avert our eyes from the low-tech periscope system when the rogue military tortures a selected destitute on every 6th hour, as a way of putting blame on us for not opening the hatch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381332/#Comment_381332" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T19:44:00+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  7:44PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2012 7:51PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not too long ago I was a simple farmer and family man. I had a wife and two beautiful children. I grew corn and wheat, milked cows and fed chickens, changed diapers and made love to the only woman I've ever loved. That was then. This is now. We were holed up in our storm shelter when a group of men from the city found us. Audrey and the kids were sleeping. I was lost in pool of whiskey and classic rock. By the time I realized we weren't alone, the savages had killed and raped my wife. They didn't even give my son a chance. They had slit his throat a while ago. My daughter was out cold and bleeding on the cement floor. Apparently they were saving her for later. I killed the five men without hesitation. The liqour numbed the pain and the anger brought out a brutal rage. When the blur was over, I had caved in their heads with a ball-peen hammer. I took Lizzy and ran. I couldn't let her see what was left of her mother and brother. We drove until the gas ran out. Then I found another car and stole it. We drove for a long, long time. I didn't know what to do so I took Lizzy to her grandmother's house. I later found her dead in the nearby field. She shot herself in the head.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been staying here since. I have nightmares about my wife constantly. I don't sleep much anymore. Lizzy reads during the day. I sit on the porch with a shotgun. Sometimes I swear I see my wife and son walking in the distance. I'm not convinced I'm halucinating. Sometimes I hear whispers as if someone is standing right behind me, but when I turn, there's nobody there. There is an eerie wind in the trees that gives me the chills. I think Lizzy wants to kill herself. Everday at dusk, a truck drives down the road beyond the mill. I can hear the hoots and hollars of crazed men on a joy ride. One day they'll decide to pay gramma's house a visit. I have two barrels waiting for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't wait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
