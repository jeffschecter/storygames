How we can improve the process and where it's going wrong. And time and again, I find myself shaking my head and going "what are you on?" are the screen. Then I rend my clothes and beat my chest. Oh, yes, I do.<br/><br/>Why? Because Indies games are already typically clearer, better designed, better constructed and better laid out than the majority of commercial games. Recently I picked up Dark Heresy, and WHFRP, and I was reading through Dark Heresy and thinking, hey, this is really well written for a commercial - the rules suck, but it's pretty and they haven't let the layout get in the way of readability too much, but what is up with the typesetting? Then I read WFRP. Ick. What an awful, unreadable choice of font! At least it is ragged right, hey?<br/><br/>Then I put in an order for Primitive, InSpectres, My Life with Master and Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>Primitive is the worst of the four (in terms of production values and explaining itself) but, you know what, it <i>still</i> lays out the rules of the game in a clearer, more straight forward way than the commercial games. As for the others, they're <i>leagues</i> ahead of the mainstream. InSpectres and My Life with Master are a positive <i>joy</i>. Clear, functional layouts with plenty of wide space and a legible font in a decent size.<br/><br/>And that's just layout, where we're supposed to be at such a disadvantage. When you get into the rules, we're frickin' miles ahead in terms of producing a set of rules that are coherent, playable and actual work together to produce play that is fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129657/#Comment_129657" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T05:26:27+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  5:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This is me, waving the happy flag of agreement.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129668/#Comment_129668" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T06:23:15+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  6:23AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotta agree with you.

I measure the quality of games against the standards of <i>other media. </i>I'm not saying anyone else should, but I do.

I.e., since we know that Sturgeon's Law applies to both indie and trad alike, we need to compare the respective 1%. IMO, the indie stuff is winning that race.<br/><br/>It'll also depend on how one defines "best." If you look at Amazon's vs. IPR's bestsellers, you've got RPGs like D&amp;D, Dark Heresy, and Serentiy competing against BW, BE, and SotC. I'm sorry, but IPR is the victor there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It'll be interesting to revisit this again post-D&amp;D-4e, though.
