Take the tactical combat of D&amp;D 4th (the board, minis, and how the powers interact), but move it to a board filled with abstract ideas (much like WotG's Great Game has the Elephant Board).<br/><br/>So social combat could be plotted out and detailed in the same way that more physical combat is with Straw Men as minions and two skilled courtiers literally dancing around each other for moral "high ground" (that gives a situational bonus for whoever is in that square).  It would be like Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits with miniatures!<br/><br/>Just a random idea for your day                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149723/#Comment_149723" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T13:02:16+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  1:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's WotG?

I think we both had mixed to good success.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, there would be some weirdness where class-niches and social battle intersect (Wizards are really good at defeating Straw Man arguments!) but if you have the patience to re-color everything, the system should work just fine, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149757/#Comment_149757" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T13:41:13+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  1:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jono: WotG is Weapons of the Gods.  The Elephant Board is, as Aaron notes, a board filled with abstract ideas that you move pieces on.  "I push you back into the Honest Zone" isn't that far off, really. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Not to derail the thread, but has anyone actually read The Great Game rules and actually understood them completely?  I'm not new to Borgstromancy by any means (Nobilis seemed rather straightforward to me, really), and I was quite excited after reading some APs involving the Great Game rules from the Companion, but...<br/><br/>...is it actually playable?  Does it actually work? <br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
