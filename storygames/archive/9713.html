I don't have the sand to write up both my games right now, but here are the set-ups.  The first group chose the Suburbia playset:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fiasco/gpnw_suburbia.jpg"/><br/>The Klingon sword did come into play, but not in the predictable manner of Klingon swords. Here's the table during play:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/gpnw_2009/gpnw_suburban_fiasco.jpg"/><br/><br/> And the second group chose The Ice:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fiasco/gpnw_ice.jpg"/><br/>This game ended with two of the characters humping in a giant tractor-bus while a third orchestrated the blowing up of said bus.  We played the same scene from the killer's POV, and then from the lovers, the latter interspersed with little callbacks - it was great.<br/><br/>If you played in either session, I hope you'll chime in with your thoughts.  If you played in Matthew's game, which was set in the 1880's boomtown, what the hell went down?  All I know is that it involved a mountain howitzer and some opium.

Brother is a pimp, one of his ex-prostitutes is trying to go "legit" and runs a burlesque theatre.  She's deep in debt and favours, and her lawyer is using the theatre to get dirt on the rich and powerful.<br/><br/>Her lawyer is also working cons with the sister, and the theatre is their next target.<br/><br/>... things go about as well as you would expect.<br/><br/>There was betrayal and mayhem, although only one person took it to the face from a double-barreled shotgun, and he wasn't a PC (bartender at the theatre).<br/><br/>We had a bit of a disconnect between the way the character arcs were heading, and the epilogues that were presented by the rules, but we were able to make things work with a little creative interpretation.<br/><br/>It was kinda neat because it ended up with no one having a "bad" ending - technically, we all did well - the lawyer is still running scams and blackmailing important people, the pimp and prostitute are running the burlesque theatre together, and the con artist sister had skipped town with a boatload of cash.<br/><br/>But scratching the surface of that, we had the lawyer who just hated himself, and you just knew would have a bad end after blackmailing the wrong someone.  The pimp and the prostitute who just can't, despite themselves, break out of their abusive cycle.  And the most positive personal outcome - the con artist, is free and clear with a ton of money, but has betrayed her family, is completely alone, and can never go back.<br/><br/>Very dark.  Not so much the "caper gone wrong" feel to it - no one (important) died, and the caper actually went off, but grim, grim downward spirals for all the characters.<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216069/#Comment_216069" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T14:36:36+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  2:36PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Super cool.

I've read the rules since and there is some direction and emphasis I neglected when explaining the game procedures. Everyone was a pleasure to play with and I enjoyed the game, but there were a couple rocky spots.  We also made some creative choices early on that we had to sort of muscle past, kind of like in improv where someone adds something that is out of left field but you soldier on; no ret-con'ing!<br/><br/>We ended up with two Locations rather than two Needs, something that is suggested by the text  for four players and probably would have been a stronger option facilitating play. We talked about who our Need, "to get even with a rival," might apply to and came up with a couple possibilities based on the characters and their relationships but we left it open before we started play, which was, I think, also not ideal. Good player instincts quickly had all the characters needing things from one another but I think it would have been better if we'd quickly established exactly who the rivals were AND the nature of the past terrible deed that needed evening up.<br/><br/>As Ryan said, it was mostly a heist story where none of the players end up with the take.  Ping's character Liam wasn't even a part of the heist and she included the completely awesome (and obvious-in-a-good-way for the genre) narration of Liam intercepting a bullet with the cash box and having the money fly everywhere at the abandoned mine meet-up.<br/><br/>The mountain Howitzer never went off.  I could just hear the movie audience going, "Aww Man!  What was up with that Howitzer in all the close-ups?!?  I totally thought someone was going to get their head taken off with that thing!"  The Howitzer was a famous one from the Civil War era displayed, bizarrely, outside one of two rival churches in town.  Liam was obsessed with it and eventually stole it because it raised the profile of the rival church above his own where he volunteered.<br/><br/>Ping and maybe Ryan had some questions and concerns about the "game" aspect of the giving dice away, trying to collect one color or the other, and the influence of that "game" relative to the needs of the narrative in a given scene and overall.  I couldn't offer my interpretation of design intent at the time, not having read the rules.  And now that I have read the rules, I don't want to put words in their mouths.  Maybe they can provide clarity for you here or privately.<br/><br/>I had some cognitive dissonance reconciling the aftermath roll for one or two of the characters relative to the ingame fiction in the last couple scenes.  It felt like some pretty extended montages were needed to get the character that seemed like they were going to come out on top to the completely horrible fate that the dice mandated.  Depending on your sense of "Cohen justice" you might want a truly amoral character to come out on top and the lovelorn bystander to be hacheted to death.  The dice may or may not cooperate.  Which is fine, and appropriate to the genre; it's just that getting from "Z" (where the story seemed to be going at the "end") to the Aftermath, may want some additional text support and suggestions.<br/><br/>I'd like to play this game a second (and third and fourth) time with the same players, or to try it a first time with my regular group that I've played with a lot.  I can see how the resolution could work very smoothly among people who've played together several times.  In our session, maybe owing to my poor direction, we tended to talk out several possiblities for what might happen before settling on one - worried about stepping on strangers' preferences, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really enjoyed meeting and playing with Ping, Ryan and Paul.  Thanks for your patience and enthusiasm.  Even though I've been a GM more than two-thirds of the time in my thirty-year RP'ing "career," that was actually my first time facilitating a con game!  Running it without reading the rules may mean I am an ambitious person with poor impluse control.  Hopefully it was a complete Fiasco!  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216135/#Comment_216135" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T23:11:22+00:00" title="July  2, 2009 11:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>Very dark.

Leaving Details to get fleshed out in play seems to always weaken them, in one case in our game to the point of 100% neglect; getting everyone on the same page with them before Scene 1 conversely seems to make them feel more like part of the furniture of the fiction, something you need to come back to again and again.<br/><br/>Just out of curiosity, how much did you get out of your double Locations?

Our single actual location was a Chinese laundry.  I don't know that we got either of our "locations" to pop, but the hotel cash box definitely set the agenda for the session, and its location between the two easterners George and Stephen helped quickly determine that they would be the heist instigators.  The location of the Chinese Laundry between Liam and James may have focused the important part of their relationship as being about James' opium addiction since we quickly established that was where it could be gotten.<br/><br/>I think it's fine if your playset Location is merely one among many places where things go wrong.  All the playset items are potential catalysts but they probably don't have to all be burning crucibles of happening to have an entertaining game.<br/><br/>I think there are some interesting things that might be said about the other game I participated in but I am spinning a lot of plates right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216758/#Comment_216758" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T17:37:52+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  5:37PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2009 11:04PM by ping.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many, many thanks to Matthew for facilitating Fiasco so we could try it out. We had a fun time and a good story. I like the story and character seeding, and we picked the Western setting which worked pretty well for us though I agree with Ryan that picking the suburbs would have probably been easier and served us better. The suburbs are more familiar to us as players and with any historical setting there's always the added challenge of keeping the anachronisms out which may be an unecessary burden when trying a game out at a con. I completely cop to making the howitzer the subject of a church squabble. It was out of left field and we certainly did have to muscle throught this particular plot point. Thanks, guys!<br/><br/>I did have some questions about the game, but I wanted to read the rules first before commenting. So having done that, here are some thoughts:<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY: We didn't follow the rules that say that you should make dice decisions as your character, not player. I think had we done this, it would have changed the game a lot. Our decisions were mostly based on what was good for the story because that's natural for story gaming. This is something that should be made clear up front in the rules and not buried in the middle.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a result of this, I didn't feel the dice mechanics enforced or supported the "fiasco" genre and we players just had to collectively develop a good, crazy story on our own and picked dice accordingly and as a group. Additionally, because none of us knew what was on the Aftermath table, the dice in front of us seemed pretty arbitrary and I suspected that when people were choosing to give out dice after resolving, they were basing it more on evenly distributing the dice among players more than anything else.<br/><br/>I would like to play it again with the clear intention of making dice decisions from the POV of my character to get a true feel for the game, but I wonder if it would be better if the dice mechanics helped mix it up or generate the fiasco narration in some more direct way.<br/><br/>Questions about dice mechanics:<br/>* If picking dice is supposed to be from the character POV, then I would expect that the player will always pick white dice if they can for a positive outcome. BUT - if the player is collecting black dice because having all black dice gives their character a better outcome on the Aftermath table (a meta-game concept the character really knows nothing about) how does it work that the character would want negative outcomes for purely for meta-game reasons? This also applies for giving dice to other characters - I want to give my brother positive outcomes, but maybe he needs more black dice for a better Aftermath roll.<br/><br/>* How do the players decide what color die to give to the current player if they disagree? For instance, my character wants his brother to get the money, but Ryan's character wants it for himself so doesn't want the brother to get it. What to do? We never disagreed because the best thing for the story always seemed clear, but if it's really from the character's POV...<br/><br/>TILT: Matthew and Paul had the largest number of black or white dice so they chose the Tilt elements while Ryan and I took a break. When we came back, we kept playing so we didn't select Tilt items together as is suggested in the rules. We also didn't pause and discuss how the Tilt would integrate into the game, where the game was going, how it was going etc. As a result, I don't think we integrated the Tilt elements explicitly, but they just sort of fit into where we were already sort of going.<br/><br/>AFTERMATH: For my character, I could and would have been happy to narrate anything on the Aftermath list, good, bad or otherwise, so I felt very indifferent towards my pile of dice. In fact I ended up with a 1, which is "disaster" according to the rules and so my character had a horrible tragic ending. Great! <br/><br/>Matthew's point that the dice mechanics don't link the story to the aftermath as well as it could is well taken because my character came out of the story riding high and so we had to narrate a seemingly unrelated fall from grace into drug addiction and death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216802/#Comment_216802" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T21:58:33+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  9:58PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ping</cite>If picking dice is supposed to be from the character POV, then I would expect that the player will always pick white dice if they can for a positive outcome.

The rules seem to encourage you to play the metagame, and to encourage your friends to make playing the metagame really painful.  Whenever the text talks about choosing dice, it talks about trying to collect dice of one color or the other; when you resolve a scene, and thus get to keep the die you choose, your friends should try to make the fiction hurt you for your choice.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in our first game: It's John's last turn, and he has three black dice and obviously would love that fourth one.  He chooses to resolve.  Getting three black dice like that has taken his toll on his character, who is in a wheelchair, gutshot, with a colostomy bag. We know we're going to have to make him work for his fourth, so I propose putting my guy, ultimately the cause of his misery, at his life-or-death mercy.  He seriously considered taking that white die, since he didn't know what we had in mind to complete the superfecta of his guy's suffering.  But he grabbed the black die, and we all got to narrate a reversal of the situation, torture, and kidnapping, which in the next scene would lead to him getting run over by a truck.  His 14 Black Aftermath was narrated as barely surviving, but getting away with murder, keeping all the money, and benefiting from a lifetime of government-paid spongebaths from pretty nurses.<br/><br/>The first scene in the replay is a good example of making a white die hurt.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ping</cite>How do the players decide what color die to give to the current player if they disagree?

I _think_ it says that when you are resolving, you pick the die according to you character's orientation.  This is top of page 9. (Jason, it would be helpful if the playtest text had page numbers) It's more unclear when your friends are choosing for you if you establish because it says they can choose however they want, but you could also infer that it's character oriented.<br/><br/>I know the text says that "positive outcome" is something is deliberately fuzzy, but I read picking positive/negative outcome as purely from character's perspective with just the information available to the character at the time with no knowledge of the future or out-of-game, meta-game information - sort of the traditional in-game, out-of-game RPG distinctions. This is why I wonder why a character would ever pick a negative outcome for themselves, even if a positive outcome is horrific or self-sacrificial in the fiction, doesn't it forward the character's goals in some way and should get a white die?<br/><br/>It then says later down the page, when you are giving the die away if you established, it's for out-of-game, meta-game reasons so I misread this the first time. This is a big distinction. A question about the text here choosing "who you want to support or mess with" :  Are there mechanical reasons I would want to support Player X but mess with Player Y? I can't think of any direct benefit to my dice if I mess with or support any particular person other than for the fun of it or because I want their character to end up a particular way which is fine but I'm checking. Maybe I want to encourage players to horde dice that I don't want leaving me dice that I do want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216831/#Comment_216831" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T04:41:38+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  4:41AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good stuff, keep it coming.  One thing I've noticed is that some games peak early (Chris' game did, too), and I have a way to address this as an option.  When I play I encourage people to pace it more slowly, more like this:<br/><br/>First die:  Establishing character and goals<br/>Second die:  Taking decisive action toward goals.<br/>Tilt<br/>Third die:  Damage control.<br/>Fourth die:  The last hurrah - tying up loose ends, making another run at your goal, getting revenge, etc.<br/><br/>Doesn't always work out that way, and that's fine.<br/><br/>I'll make sure the choice of outcome is clearly defined in the final text.  If it still says your decision should be predicated on the character's POV exclusively, that's an artifact.  You should metagame the hell out of your choice, whether you are giving a die to someone who established or are resolving for yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217044/#Comment_217044" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T14:27:21+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  2:27PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2009 7:26PM by ping.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You should metagame the hell out of your choice, whether you are giving a die to someone who established or are resolving for yourself.</blockquote>If a large part of the game is to meta-game and be competitive and make others work for the dice, this should be well-established at the beginning of the game as a "win-condition" that you want all dice of one color and you want to prevent other players from achieving the same because that's the only way your character will have a good aftermath. I see it's there in the Why Die Choices Matter section, but I don't think it's nearly prominent enough for being so central to the game. The previous 9 pages outline character building, scene framing and advice for the genre, but don't give any hint that this is supposed to be a meta-gamey, quasi-competitive game. Because the mechanics aren't overtly competitive (i.e. point scores or moving along a win track), without this knowledge upfront, I don't think the players will jump right into the meta-game because there's no obvious reason to. I think that's what happened to us. Our group happily missed the entire competitive/meta-game part and basically had a great session building a fun story together.<br/><br/>EDIT - In retrospect, I can't speak for the other players. Paul and Matthew did seem to be working towards collecting one color of dice or the other which is why their characters ended up in a happier place so maybe I'm just slow on the uptake. It just seemed to me when discussing what to die to give for resolving or framing scenes for establishing, the status of the player's dice pool vis a vis the aftermath was never a factor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217380/#Comment_217380" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T23:47:36+00:00" title="July  8, 2009 11:47PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurred to me, shortly before the Tilt, two white dice in hand, that I should do what I could to re-direct black dice elsewhere. I succeeded in that and ended up with 3 or 4 white dice by largely passing off dice to other players. I came to realize about a couple scenes from the end of the game that the other Players could easily frame my character's death scene. Then what good would all those white dice do? I think all of our characters lived through the mine scene because none of the Players wanted to murder a character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I had a great time playing the game.
