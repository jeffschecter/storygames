Can I just write about my gaming day today? I think I will. I just need to shout it from the mountaintops, you know?<br/><br/>So the group met today, to play our first session of Dogs in the Vineyard. One of the guys wasn't excited at all to play the setting as it's written, as he grew up in Utah, had Mormonism shoved down his throat for years, and now lives in Seattle with no contact with his Mormon family in Utah. Tough stuff, I can understand.<br/><br/>But when it came down to it, the rest of us were really excited about playing the game as it was written, and we couldn't come up with any good compromises, so he bowed out of the game, and we went with a once-a-month Dogs game, and a once-a-month GURPS game (which I wasn't happy about. I want to play Dogs way more than once a month, damnit! But you gotta compromise, and I'm cool with trying GURPS, especially since I got my Dogs the way I wanted it).<br/><br/>So he left, and myself and the other player got set making characters. We only got as far as playing through our initial conflicts, as the setting discussion had eaten a couple of hours.<br/><br/>My friend's character, Althea Griffiths, wanted to impress her teacher with her hand-to-hand fighting skills, so the teacher set up a fight with another (male) student who kept berating her for being a woman and not knowing her place. Althea kicked his ass and quoted scripture at him at the same time ("All are children of the King of Life"), so then my friend added the 1d6 trait to his character, "I impressed my teacher with my fighting skills."<br/><br/>My character wanted to distance himself from the reputation of his failure of a father, who was once a Dog, but deserted his post during active duty, came back to the Temple with his tail between his legs, and now serves food to the Dog trainees. We had a conflict with a fellow trainee in the mess hall, with Hiram the trainee calling out my character, Brother Judah, for being a weakling and coward like my father. Brother Judah froze up, his worst fears made public, and couldn't respond to Hiram. Finally he slammed down his plate, stood up, pointed at his father, and vowed that he was not like the man. Hiram undercut him with, "You're acting like an ass in public, just like him." Judah would've been out of it at that point, but he escalated, grabbing Hiram by his shirt, looking him in the eyes, and spitting the words, "I am not the man," then hauling off and landing only a glancing blow. Hiram shot back with a solid punch to the face, with Judah bleeding from his nose all over himself and looking stupid. I ended up losing the conflict, so I took the 1d6 trait, "People associate me with my failure of a father". Also, I took Fallout, and so I decided to lose the knife my father gave me, which my mother made me promise I would carry, by chucking it in a rage into the grain fields right after I was humiliated in the mess hall. I also got some experience for that conflict, so I decided to give myself another die to the existing trait, "I'm the man in my family", to represent my character further resolving that his father is a weakling, and he wants to be nothing like him.<br/><br/>Am I raving? Because I feel like I am. And it feels good.<br/><br/>I mean, isn't that damn cool? I'm not trying to toot my own horn, it's just, I have all this energy. This hobby of ours is so damn cool. And now I'm repeating myself. This is my first real gaming group, and even though I own a lot of RPG books and have read a lot of them, and talk and read online about them all the time, I've never had a smash-bang experience with a game, and I was beginning to worry that perhaps I'm only into this hobby in my head. Today erased all that. I love, <i>love</i>, this thing we do. Isn't it the greatest?<br/><br/>It's like, you can read about games and read games themselves until you're blue in the face, but once you sit down with real humans, make characters, and throw down those dice, this shit comes alive like God's Word.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194921/#Comment_194921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T03:37:20+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  3:37AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Surely the King of Life blessed your game, Brother.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194924/#Comment_194924" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T06:46:59+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  6:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>I mean, isn't that damn cool?</blockquote>\nIt sure is <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233364/#Comment_233364" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T03:31:52+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  3:31AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome.<br/><br/>Too bad about that other player.

The first session was amazing, and then we came back the next week and the GM tried to play it all mystery-style on us, like, "where's the sin in the town? Go find it, Dogs."<br/><br/>Y'know, he didn't read the "How to GM" section, and I had, and it ruined the game for me. Once we pulled books out and discussed what a game of Dogs was supposed to look like, he said, "Oh. Well if that's how it's supposed to go, then I can't run this game." I offered to run, but momentum was against Dogs, we played a session of GURPS that made me want to stab my own eyeballs, and thankfully I moved to a different city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233924/#Comment_233924" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T13:11:32+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  1:11PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what is not in the books:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>One of the guys wasn't excited at all to play the setting as it's written, as he grew up in Utah, had Mormonism shoved down his throat for years, and now lives in Seattle with no contact with his Mormon family in Utah.

The first session was amazing, by the way, because it was just initiating conflicts and we played it by-the-book.<br/><br/>When the GM realized what the game actually WAS, he couldn't take it. He liked the setting and apparently didn't give a glance as to what the game and rules were actually about. Because, I presume, he was a "really good, experienced GM." (his own words). The only thing I fault him for is assuming he understood what the book said instead of <i>reading</i> it.<br/><br/>Ah, I'll get my multiple-session Dogs sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
