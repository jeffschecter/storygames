Not sure if I get the goal.  Receiving Prizes seems to be about doing one's appointed part, at the appointed time, to the satisfaction of the other participants.  Is that accurate?  If so, then I'd interpret the goal of all players as "be as entertaining as possible" or "be as poignant as possible" or something.  If that's the case, I'd recommend stating it explicitly in the text.  <br/><br/>"...you will listen and participate as you tell a story about winning and losing and why it matters.  Your job is to make this story come to life using all of your acting, improv and story-telling skills."  Something like that.<br/><br/>Or I'm wrong about the point of play, in which case, maybe you can correct me?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines" title="Matt_Haines"><img alt="Matt_Haines" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/705/nML63TE0KV6AD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines">Matt_Haines</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428313/#Comment_428313" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-15T23:49:18+00:00" title="February 15, 2014 11:49PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your comments David. The goal is to tell a shared narrative with reward shaped guidelines. The order of Eye&gt;Hand&gt;Mouth&gt;Winner and the reward criteria that feeds one to the next is intended to create a story that initially seems to be under the control of the Winner and then is gradually drawn away from them. The Winner's Acceptance Speech is an opportunity for them to recapture ownership of an Award that we have learned they did not deserve, was manipulated by someone who cares for them and was ultimately awarded for reasons that did not recognize them at all. Will they prove that they are indeed a Winner?<br/>It is definitely a first draft so comments like yours will help me improve the Game, thank you.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428314/#Comment_428314" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T00:13:05+00:00" title="February 16, 2014 12:13AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2014 12:15AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe goal was the wrong word.  What I'm wondering is, what's the difference between playing really well and playing less well?  Which of my skills are required, challenged, or rewarded?  To me, "tell a shared narrative with reward shaped guidelines" is more a prescription than a goal -- I can't really <i>fail</i> to tell a shared narrative, can I?  But I can fail to tell a <i>good</i> one -- thus my initial impression and questions.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to hear if you see things similarly or differently!  Maybe you envision recapturing the Prizes to be more challenging than I do.  To me, it seems like a given because of the explicit requirements (mention hopes/fears for future etc.).  "Will they prove that they are indeed a Winner?"  Yes, they will.  Unless there's some obstacle I'm not seeing.<br/><br/>Re: Eye&gt;Hand&gt;Mouth&gt;Winner + Award undeserved, manipulated and off-point -- I think it's a very cool formula!  I'm just wondering what exactly I get to <i>do</i> with that formula, beyond inhabiting it (though maybe inhabiting it is enough!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines" title="Matt_Haines"><img alt="Matt_Haines" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/705/nML63TE0KV6AD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines">Matt_Haines</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428315/#Comment_428315" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T00:46:41+00:00" title="February 16, 2014 12:46AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I agree with your synopsis and l guess that my reply at this time is that the point of the game is the experience of playing it. Ideally, all four players get a turn at being the Winner, inventing an award to win then passing the narrative on to see their status slip away and to then (hopefully) recapture it. If there is any challenge for the players, it is the challenge of invention and creating a fun narrative. The prize economy is not there at this time to decide a player hierarchy.<br/>In some ways the Winner does not have to prove anything because they already have the Award. Maybe it is to see if they are worthy of it. <br/>I also think that the experience of playing Acceptance will be quite different than than that of reading it. It reads as a procedural series of steps with a circular exchange economy but I am not sure if it will seem so inevitable during play (at least the first few times). Of course I could be completely wrong about that which is why I have offered it for you to read and hopefully play.<br/>It is a simple game and is not designed to stand up to prolonged continual play because it will become repetitive regardless of the Award chosen. The optional Interrupt rule is there to find out what happens when a player wants to `buy' their way into another story. It also points the way for some more intricate mechanics for future development depending on how it plays as is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428316/#Comment_428316" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T01:05:19+00:00" title="February 16, 2014  1:05AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

I think the clarifications from this thread should be in there.  <br/><br/>As for the rules themselves, they seem quite coherent to me, given your goals that you've stated.  I'd guess that the end-game would only need more if you have additional goals.<br/><br/>Good luck finding playtesters!  Listing a time estimate might help.  This game strikes me as quick, and it's often easier to find players who will commit to 1 hour than 4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines" title="Matt_Haines"><img alt="Matt_Haines" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/705/nML63TE0KV6AD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt_Haines">Matt_Haines</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428328/#Comment_428328" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T14:24:22+00:00" title="February 16, 2014  2:24PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks David, a time budget is a great idea.
