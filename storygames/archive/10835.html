The Knight <i>(Role: Defender; General Concept: Can sacrifice his own well-being in order to hurt enemies. Can also use enemies' strengths against them)</i> starts with a Zeal power, and it's an Encounter power that lets him re-roll a given die (Same as the Deva's racial power, memory of a thousand lifetimes). However, if the die comes up its highest or lowest possible score, put a counter on the Zeal power. When it has three counters, replace the power with Weariness, which is a class ability (that reduces Will Saves and/or grants combat advantage, haven't decided yet).<br/><br/>2.) People have Zeal points instead of Healing Surges. They don't replenish daily or anything like that. Instead, whenever they hit zero, replenish to your last total -1. So, like, You start the game with 8 Zeal points, replenish to 7, replenish to 6, replenish to... When finally you have eliminated Zeal Points all together, you start gaining Weariness (either Weariness Points, or the Weariness feat - either way, Weariness = not good). Certain monsters would be able to remove Zeal Points with certain attacks.<br/><br/>Those both seem complicated and obtuse. Thoughts on how to streamline and better incorporate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240507/#Comment_240507" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T15:23:56+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  3:23PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> doesn't seem obtuse to me, I rather like that sort of diminishing refresh mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> seems a bit random...I suspect you'd rather have a rather steady, not-quite-but-almost-inexorable march towards weariness which 2 gives you but 1 does not.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion:  do you want this progression to be unique to the knights, or the same for all people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the former I think you'll probably want to do an Encounter Power structure like you have in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>...possibly with similar variants for each class but with different manifestations...i.e. each class has its own path to weariness.  If the latter you could make it a Racial Power that everyone gets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a power, I would make Zeal MUCH more powerful...like a totally unbalanced super power* so there's always the temptation to get yourself in over your head and rely on Zeal to get you back out...which I think rather nicely reflects the behavior of zealots.  This temptation would be akin to the temptation in Sorceror of summoning a demon to solve your problems and thus risk one's humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I would use a simple countdown mechanic so that Weariness comes.  Perhaps the countdown starts at 10 and is reduced by 1 every time you use your Zeal Power, every time you reach Death's Door (or whatever they call that in 4E), and every time you Level Up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCountdown = 0 then kills the Zeal Power and replaces with Weariness<br/>\n<br/>\n* as an example of the magnitude I'm thinking:  I might do something like "Activate this power, from now until the end of the encounter you have the ability to change the result of N d20 rolls to a 20 after seeing the roll; where N = your Charisma modifier" you could also flavor this by class if going for the Class differentiator.  Maybe one Class it applies only to encounters with Demonic presence (like the knight) where others (like the Senator) it applies to Skill Challenges of a certain type.  Or "activate this power, everyone within its burst effect can immediately expend as many healing surges as desired and double the number of hitpoints restored"...that sort of scale...think big.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I can't quite remember the specifics of Stances, but you might find some good possibilities modeling your Zeal power as a Stance...it makes sense from a flavor perspective and some of those Stances do some pretty creative things...including amping the effectiveness of other powers while they're "on".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240511/#Comment_240511" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T16:46:56+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  4:46PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Then I would use a simple countdown mechanic so that Weariness comes.

roleplaying and the creation of complications, because people would need more surges!<br/>(especially considering some of the classes I'm writing, especially Librarian and Knight, get to spend Healing
