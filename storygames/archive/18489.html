It went well but myself and the other player both gained a Cool Die (Hero Die in the hack) right near the start and this kind of killed the tension around the Stress (Suffering in the hack).  In our post game talk we discussed the cool dice rules, which I don't really like now, and I expressed my desire for an Inspectres "hard mode".<br/><br/>That got me thinking.  There's a scale for games in how much the difficulty comes from the rules and how much it comes from the GM.  Tradtional games I think try to be neutral on the difficulty arising from the rules and puts the difficulty responsibility onto the GM.  A game like Inspectres has it mostly come from the rules with the GM having a very limited scope with which to challenge the players (failure, scene setting and stress rolls).  I'm looking forward to Torchbearer due to its advertised inherent hard mode.<br/><br/>Can you give any good examples of rules reinforcing difficulty in play rather than coming from another player or GM?  Especially interested in when a traditional game does it.<br/><br/>You could probably hack a game to be harder by simply inflating the difficulty numbers or whatever.  But I'm sure there are games that do it more sneakily than that!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416138/#Comment_416138" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T04:50:59+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  4:50AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel games are probably your best example, but you also have Marvel Heroic Roleplaying.

Other games have inherent challenges in the rules, perhaps it makes you jump through hoops as a player. <br/><br/>I've got an example.<br/><br/>The condition recovery order in Mouse Guard makes that game more challenging than it would otherwise be.  It's a nuisance to recover in Mouse Guard!  But as long as the characters have conditions they've got to recover them in the prescribed order.  That's something the game did, not the GM, the game could have said "recover them however you want", but it didn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416146/#Comment_416146" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T05:37:54+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  5:37AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Describing a difficulty as a nuisance seems to me to be describing something undesirable in a game. I'm not really a hoop jumping person, the rule has got to make the game more interesting rather than be just an exercise in blocking.<br/><br/>And the GM can always tweak the difficulty, even in hard games. <br/><br/>So, for example, guns Call of Cthulhu do more damage per shot than they do in Trail of Cthulhu, and you get more shots too, but the GM decides how many hit points an enemy creature has and the tactics of the enemy. Also, there is no dodging in Trail but there is in Call. Only a detailed statistical analysis would tell you which game kills more PCs in gun fights.<br/><br/>The more you move into story games, the less hardness makes sense I imagine.

I'm pondering on the idea that the game's artwork and fictionally descriptive parts provide inspiration for game content and communicate an expected tone that way.  The participants of a game that is advertised as dark and gritty are more likely the kinds of people that will bring the dark and gritty to their games.  I can also see that the rules can contribute, by how saves work or the relative price of learning the next spell.  If you had a situation with a "soft" GM not bringing the expected difficulty it's probably a communication thing.  I think I may not have appreciated the full importance of art and marketing in the past.<br/><br/>As for spendable points, it could be that the game is avoiding being challenging in a particular way so that you can play hard in another.  Burning Wheel has such rules where fights end in fleeing and the will to live is quite powerful but it'll screw your beliefs into the ground.  I think it says that survival is not the source of difficulty but challenge is supported in some other part of the game instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416273/#Comment_416273" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T08:14:05+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  8:14AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2013 8:17AM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's a scale for games in how much the difficulty comes from the rules and how much it comes from the GM.

Anything with a D&amp;D-style level system is enough enough to put on hard-mode by just running PCs through an adventure designed for higher-level. (This happened to my D&amp;D group relatively recently, where we were nearly destroyed by a school of really nasty fish because of some bad calls and a level miscalculation during prep.) The DM isn't making things harder through fiat, but through application of the game rules, and some players might even appreciate that: In D&amp;D 4e, at least, if you can survive "hard mode," you're getting more XP and better loot.<br/><br/>This is actually very much like the difficulty settings programmed into modern video game RPGs like the Fallout/Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect series, where moving the difficulty slider basically does nothing more than make enemies hit harder and sustain more damage. (And in Fallout 3, at least, there is also a commensurate bonus to XP gain.) <br/><br/>Personally, I almost exclusively use the difficulty slider in video games as a corrective when I've played a game so many times that I'm too good at it to be excited by the challenges. What I'd really like to see, though, is more video games that rethink what a "difficulty mode" should be like, such as Fallout New Vegas's "Hardcore Mode." The way that mode is implemented is actually kind of dull and numbers-crunchy, but the idea behind it is a good one: making it harder to heal yourself, harder to stock up on unlimited ammo, harder to survive in the desert. Instead of just making <i>harder</i> challenges of the same kind you've already mastered (which leads to unbelievable scenes of shooting people repeatedly in the head), it's intended to introduce a broader, more believable array of challenges. In essence, it's trying to encourage telling stories of hardship.<br/><br/>This is, to my mind, the most interesting way to build a "hard mode" into tabletop RPGs, as well: Not just rules for making combat tougher, but optional rules for other kinds of challenges. And I think we see that, but usually not phrased as "optional" rules. Rather, as noted above, you're more likely to see the game selling itself on its "gritty combat system" that encourages PC death, rather that "and with an optional hardcore mode for players who crave danger!" Maybe what games use now is a better marketing tactic for such small niche audiences, though, while video games need to appease larger markets \u2013\xa0and they don't have the GM/DM there to correct things that frustrate individual players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416275/#Comment_416275" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T09:09:34+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  9:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Oh, also: highlighting low stats in Apocalypse World.

It depends what you're gaming for, doesn't it? Is the focus of your gaming to defeat challenges set up by the GM, to gamble against difficult odds, to create powerful fiction, to create moving drama, to brainstorm new ideas, to get to know each othe better? What is it? All of those things can vary in difficulty.<br/><br/>However, lots of "story games" balance positive and negative consequences via their mechanics, which makes it easy to judge the odds. For example, Ghost/Echo (John Harper's game) is arguably "easier" on the characters than the original mechanic presented in Otherkind Dice, because it defaults to one Danger instead of two, while keeping all other odds the same.<br/><br/>Another interesting example is something like Dogs in the Vineyard, where winning conflicts is generally not all that hard (sometimes hardly even in question, unless dealing with demonic possession and large crowds), but the game still feels very "hard" because the point of playing is very specifically not to win those conflicts, but to make the right choices in the presence of the pressure applied by the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416380/#Comment_416380" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T15:29:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  3:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Maybe I misunderstand you, but I'd say that traditional games are actually more likely to have built-in difficulty settings.

In my OSR game I explicitly tell new players that halflings and dwarfs are "easy mode" (free extra abilities at first level, but a shorter overall game due to level cap), as are clerics (versatility, low experience curve) and that elves are "hard mode" (because of the ridiculous hybrid elf class experience curve from swords and wizardry whitebox), despite being the most versatile class.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416411/#Comment_416411" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T11:22:33+00:00" title="June 16, 2013 11:22AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A brief note on the OP - what I've done is basically just reskin and doesn't change the inherent difficulty of Inspectres missions.

I wondered what the fuzz was about until I looked through the rules now. I usually let Cool be spent to ignore a stress die or to add one die temporary to a roll. Wow, Cool was <i>a lot</i> better than that. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> (As for playing the game, I tend to enforce enough stress rolls so that each mission is  a zero sum game.

What I'd really like to see, though, is more video games that rethink what a "difficulty mode" should be like, such as Fallout New Vegas's "Hardcore Mode." The way that mode is implemented is actually kind of dull and numbers-crunchy, but the idea behind it is a good one: making it harder to heal yourself, harder to stock up on unlimited ammo, harder to survive in the desert. Instead of just making <i>harder</i> challenges of the same kind you've already mastered (which leads to unbelievable scenes of shooting people repeatedly in the head), it's intended to introduce a broader, more believable array of challenges. In essence, it's trying to encourage telling stories of hardship.</blockquote>\nYes! <br/>Dwarf Fortress does this. You have to appreciate the pathos of your dwarves' plight in order to enjoy the game to its fullest; otherwise it's an exercise in ASCII-based frustration and heartbreak. The best DF blogs out there, imo, are like tragic odes to the game.
