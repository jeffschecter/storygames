It looks neat, but I'm kind of curious about how it works out in play.  Apparently it's a reworking or tightening of "Houses of the Blooded" designed for samurai tragedy, and I'm wondering how well it delivers.<br/><br/>(Even a few basic things elude me: for example, it's unclear to me if NPC's have any stats or scores, if the GM-figure ever rolls any dice and if so how many, and so on.)                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425436/#Comment_425436" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T10:14:32+00:00" title="December  7, 2013 10:14AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Blood and Honor book is with a friend, so I can't get too far into rules discussions, but does it deliver, it absolutely does. Especially if you play for at least two in-character years (8 Seasons). You really start to see what War is about, especially if you're not going to war.<br/><br/>And yes, NPCs do indeed have stats if they're important enough to be directly contesting with the player characters, see p.137 for how to do this. The exception, combat, is on p.57. If they're not named or not samurai you just kill as many of them as you can wager.  The GM rolls for all characters not played by other players. It's a regular ole RPG with a GM and players playing characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425439/#Comment_425439" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T10:32:35+00:00" title="December  7, 2013 10:32AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I can see that NPC's exist, and that the concept begins with Three Things True about the NPC.  But I dont' see anything in my version of the PDF (bought a couple days ago, with some Q&amp;A in the back) about calibrating an NPC's dice pool.  <br/><br/>Like, let's say the sample PC (Hayate the Courtier, page 24) is trying to persuade his Daimyo that an NPC geisha is really a shameless witch and seductress.  The geisha, who isn't really a witch because I don't wanna get into the magic rules, is arguing that Hayate is a jealous, spiteful wretch who should be banished from court.  Classic social conflict.<br/><br/>It's clear how many dice Hayate can roll: he's a PC, with Virtues, and Aspects, and a Courtly Function, and maybe a Reputation or whatever.  He builds a dice pool, and secretly sets a few dice aside before rolling to act as wagers later on.<br/><br/>But are NPC's built in the same way?  The geisha, does she have a Virtues?  Aspects?  Reputations?  Gear?  (I ask because in a game like Apocalypse World, NPC's exist in a role-playing sense--this character is an element of the fiction--but in a mechanical sense primarily exists as part of a Front, and perhaps as some custom moves imposed on the player: "When you try to draw Hamburglar's blood, roll Weird, and ...")<br/><br/>Does the GM-Narrator person set aside dice for wagers before rolling?  I ask because it seems like the Narrator doesn't have to sweat wagers the same way that PC's do.  <br/><br/>I apologize if all of this is answered in "Houses of the Blooded," but it wasn't made explicit in the text of "Blood &amp; Honor," at least not on a quick read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425442/#Comment_425442" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T10:53:16+00:00" title="December  7, 2013 10:53AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 6:36AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            She might have all those things?

Yes, you wouldn't find the rules for creating NPCs nor whether you NPCs are created same as PCs or not (aside of three truths). The same with war: what if there's no PC character with specific Giri (Duty), and a few similar problems (like ties in contested risks). <br/><br/>The Rules were for us a bit clumsy, writing was messy; game could use some clarifications. <br/><br/>PS.

There are rules for aging, but you had to play about 30 (sic!) sessions to change age category and almost any fight could kill the character.

It's interesting you said that about caution in narration.  It looks like once someone has won the privilege to narrate the outcome of a conflict, there is no way for another player to say "No, but...".   In fact, explicitly all you can say is "Yes, but" or "Yes, and" if you have a wager left.  In this respect, Blood &amp; Honor somewhat resembles the 2005 superhero game Capes, which at base had a similar granting of trust.  IME Capes proved very difficult to play because it became very easy to narrate extreme results, one after the other, until the fiction got so stretched that it kind of broke apart.  Blood &amp; Honor solves part of this problem by trying its best to orient its players in the samurai tragedy aesthetic, but either it's in you or it isn't.  (And also, I have found it's much easier to narrate extreme results when under time/social pressure to be creative, than to come up with something very powerful but subtle.)<br/><br/>I think there are rules for ties--whoever  rolled the larger number of dice wins, right?  But I can totally see how someone might overlook this rule when table-time is ticking away.  <b>EDITED TO ADD: Nope, that rule ain't in there.  Must have seen it on a FAQ or something.

That's not quite right. What they get is to do <i>answer the question of the conflict</i>.  They "describe the outcome of the risk."  They don't just get to say whatever they want.  (I don't think I ever played Capes' full rules so I can't comment on whether it was a problem there too.) You can't just narrate extreme results one after another unless you are getting into more and more extreme conflicts, unless you are intentionally provoking extreme/insane risks, in which case the system absolutely should help you resolve those.<br/><br/>I always just said "the GM gets privilege on a tie, but can't use it to establish an NPC win", but yep that's a problem.<br/><br/>The drama from province creation comes from war. Play a game where you meet samurai from at least 3 other provinces, then do absolutely nothing with those other provinces and watch what war does.<br/><br/>Yes, the game has mechanics that don't activate until you've played 30+ sessions, and few characters will last that long.

The overall experience was fun for me as the "Narrator" (GM), but we only had two players and I only supplied one basic situation, namely that the Courtier's brother--under the spell of a demonic saxophone--had been singing ribald and indeed openly treasonous songs about the clan's daimyo, and thus was imperiled by the Executioner's blade.  The two players ended up working the problem out, confronting an angry mob of peasants along the way.  (And setting in motion some long-term stuff with the yakuza, conspiracies, spies, and so on.)  At the end, the Courtier persuaded the daimyo that the song was the result of a demonic influence, and that the Courtier should not be castrated.  Oh, and in this season's espionage action, enemy spies are poisoning the River Dragon.<br/><br/>The system worked relatively smoothly although:<br/>* A target number of 10 is awfully low.  You can beat that 90% of the time with 4 dice, 98% of the time with 5 dice.  Most of the dice pools in the game were at least 6+, so that's a little weird--it's a world where PC's cannot fail (or rather, where they will always be able to narrate success or failure).<br/><br/>* It's improv-heavy.  Naturally.  But somehow I'd not spotted this or realized the consequences.  I hadn't prepped anything beyond a ribald, demon-addled brother, so when that business wrapped up, I ended the game (before risking drawing a huge blank on stuff).  But you don't want to prep a ton because the players will narrate all over your stuff anyway.  So you gotta be ready to go with loose stuff and if something pops into your head as a joke or a cool bit of bad-assery, just narrate that in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426486/#Comment_426486" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T14:03:44+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  2:03PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you are going to overwhelmingly succeed unless you're in a situation where you're dealing with your Weakness.  The whole point of that is so that you throw more Risks in rather than worry about beating a 10. Or maybe you really desperately need to get privilege this time so you can't throw many Risks in. <br/><br/>Sorry I didn't reply before, but the aging rules are along the same principle as high-level play in BECMI D&amp;D - you want to have stuff like Immortals and having a keep and such even though overwhelmingly few characters will reach those levels because 1) it shows you what the "end" of your character will be even if you don't reach it, and 2) when you do reach it, it will be a big, big deal.  When your guy retires due to age and passes his sword to his son, or (!!) his only daughter (?!?) that will be a big deal everyone remembers.  If it happened to everyone, meh, who cares.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
