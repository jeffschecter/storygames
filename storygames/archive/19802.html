I've just finished my new game, here, have it!<br/>It's called <b>Launch Day!</b><br/>Well, to be more precise it's called Launch Day, Part One: Asphalt Walkers. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>It's a sleek 12 pages, 3-4 hours, 4-5 players.<br/><br/><br/>Pitch? Yeah, got it right here:<br/><i>A group of suburban homeowners build a rocket ship in a garage so two of them can visit a strange settlement on top of a cloud. This game explores one side of a peaceful cultural exchange and examines assumptions about the others and about how we wish to be known.</i><br/><br/>The link is on my website!<br/><a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/launch-day-part-one/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.photographsoflightning.com/launch-day-part-one/</a><br/><br/><br/>I bet you're wondering about that "Part One" thing. <br/><br/>Well, I'll be kicking off my Patreon page on October 23rd. Would you help me spread the word? Though this game is fun on its own, it does have a continuation game for a second session... and yeah, I'm pretty proud of it. That'll be my first Patreon release, exclusive to my Patrons the day I make my page public...
