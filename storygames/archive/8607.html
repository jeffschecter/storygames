Forbidden City was the entry in which I saw the most potential. Today's playtest gave glimpses of that, but also showed just how far it has to go before that potential is realized.<br/><br/>The players, who weren't used to the sorts of games that get designed around the story games forums, enjoyed contributing a lot to the story. It proved to be surprisingly cinematic, which I'm not sure was the intent, but it was enjoyed.<br/><br/>The mechanics needed to provide better guidance to shape resolution (degree of success was suggested, but that doesn't quite fit with the game).<br/><br/>It was suggested that, instead of putting dice that come up 6s back into the pool, to put dice that are chosen for success back in. We had an unusual number of rolls where 5 was the highest, and players accumulated dice pretty quickly because of that.<br/><br/>Collecting dice of different colours really gave the players a sense of where their characters were going. The way that players had to tell story to get dice also helped a lot. It took a while to find the right balance of description before a fight, since so much of the decision as to what happens occurs after mechanical resolution. There was also very little sense of risk in the mechanics, which made it harder to build tension in the story.<br/><br/>Wounds were a problem, too, as they didn't seem to do much. One player suggested that, instead of just damage, wound dice should somehow reflect a crisis that the character must face and overcome.<br/><br/>As the Emperor (gamemaster), I felt a little left out of the game, since I didn't actually interact with the mechanics much. Cowardice dice and smoke dice would somehow initially be held and used by the GM and added to the pool as the story progressed.<br/><br/>The lack of background to the game proved a real obstacle. I had my own knowledge of Chinese history and Chinese stories to pull from, but without that, I would have been in trouble.<br/><br/>Losing Control: was a bit superfluous. Losing by a method you didn't want had a similar effect on the players.<br/><br/>A minor detail. Gold vs. Yellow dice. Yes, it's easy to substitute another colour, but it's better if the rules don't suggest such similar colours.<br/><br/>All in all, everyone had a lot of fun. With some more development, Forbidden City could make a really respectable small press game or inspire similar treatments to other games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190756/#Comment_190756" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T03:14:33+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  3:14AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Graham, that's great. I really appreciate that.<br/><br/>What sort of additional guidance should the mechanics provide to affect resolution? <br/><br/>Losing Control is meant to be rather important. Essentially, it's the only way to lose a conflict: you succeed in what you were trying to do, but lose control and go far further than you intended. How did it work in your game? Could you give me an example?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190758/#Comment_190758" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T04:25:07+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  4:25AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2009 4:31AM by madunkieg.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Losing Control: We forgot about it some of the time, which turned out to be good story-wise, because the odds of 6s coming up makes it more likely than not (players were usually rolling 3-4 dice each), thereby losing the "excessive" feel that losing control should have. One did end up shooting the British Admiral, though he did it because his character had been moving towards sympathy for the Cantonese, not because he rolled a 6, and would have done the same had he won with any other number on a cowardice die.<br/><br/>There are other ways to "lose," though. Rolling a lot of 1s felt like it should have been a loss, and players happily tried to narrate those results as a loss or near-loss. Winning by a method you didn't want to (e.g. developing sympathy to the cantonese when you intended to be superior) is another, and that really felt like a loss, too. The game often ground to a halt as a player who expected to win with certain dice, but didn't, had to come up with how to use the dice he actually won with.<br/><br/>Providing extra guidance: Having the mechanic for scene resolution occur near the start of the scene (because you have develop the story based on the dice results, not how or why you choose to enter the fight) just felt awful. There needs to be some process of buildup. The fights could have two steps, one setting up the climactic moment (perhaps choosing which character will be the "hero" for the fight), and another to resolve the climactic moment and determine how the fight is won. Players really wanted to confront the crises suggested by their wound colours. Making a wounds inspire a critical moment in a conflict might be one way to do this.<br/><br/>Players also wanted some way of using their dice in non-combat situations, so instead of saving dice for just fights, it might be an idea to suggest rolling for any sort of conflict. This also helps cycle dice back into the pool more often, making a more dynamic story.<br/><br/>I just noticed that the suggestion for having the Emperor hold some of the cowardice and smoke dice at the start of the story and introduce them as things progress uses "would" instead of "could".<br/><br/>I forgot to mention that the players really liked the process of earning dice by adding description to the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190792/#Comment_190792" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T15:05:24+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  3:05PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you explain a little more about this bit?\n<blockquote>Providing extra guidance: Having the mechanic for scene resolution occur near the start of the scene (because you have develop the story based on the dice results, not how or why you choose to enter the fight) just felt awful.

The part after the dice takes longer than the part before because a lot of the bits you'd use to set yourself up before fights in other games (positioning, tactcs, etc.) simply don't matter in the mechanics. Instead, the greatest detail in the mechanics comes after the roll: how you got wounded and your method of winning. Here's how it is now:<br/><br/>G - There's an abandoned cannon in the street, pointed at a destroyed pagoda. Four scavengers trying to make off with the cannon.<br/>L - I'll yell at them and then take a shot.<br/>W - I'll join in, too, but I'll just wait for them to rush us and use the bayonet.<br/>(rolling, W gets 1,1 and L gets a 5 equipment, 3, 2)<br/>W - Well, they spot us and come running. I try to stab one, but he has some strange kung fu that parries my bayonet and he and his friend start beating me in the head.<br/>L - My shot takes down the first one and I swing the butt of the rifle to knock away the ones beating on W, letting them run away.<br/><br/>That's not much of an exciting scene. The mechanic makes the fight seem insignificant, because if you set up the potential for character conflict, the dice may have a result that is irrelevant to that inner conflict. Not only that, it's so fast that there's no time for tension to build, and there's no sense of tension in the mechanic because it is so incredibly random.<br/><br/>If there had been two steps this would have gone better. For example:<br/>G - There's an abandoned cannon in the street, pointed at a destroyed pagoda. Four scavengers trying to make off with the cannon.<br/>L - Well, I've got a, "faith" wound, so this is my chance to redeem myself and my service. I'll demand that those heathens get away from that British property!<br/>W  - I'll just stand aside and look intimidating beside the lieutenant.<br/>(possible place to put a mechanic to set the stakes for the conflict and determine the enemy's reactions)<br/>G - The scavengers look up from dragging the cannon, look at each other a moment, indicate that the cannon is theirs, then all come rushing towards you as a mob.<br/>L - I'll take a shot, then.<br/>W - I'll join in, too, but I'll just wait for them to get close and use the bayonet.<br/>(rolling, W gets 1,1 and L gets a 5, 3, 2)<br/>W - I try to stab one, but he has some strange kung fu move that parries my bayonet and both he and his friend start beating me in the head.<br/>L - My shot takes down the first one and I swing the butt of the rifle to knock away the ones beating on W, letting them run away leaving their friend bleeding in the street.<br/>(mechanic doesn't eliminate the wound, because wrong die type won, loses his winning die)<br/>L - I lean on my weapon a while, staring at the man dying in the street, before reloading.<br/><br/>It's not much different, but the extra length gives a chance for the the conflict to take shape and develop. There are also now stakes and rewards (wounds), prompting some emotional investment. The short bit of story that is told between choosing the stakes and rolling for resolution gives that emotion a chance to build up within the player's mind and have more impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190967/#Comment_190967" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T02:57:31+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  2:57AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2009 3:18AM by Graham.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!
