Or a game about how the events of the main course ripple out into the world. <br/><br/>ie, we expand on the style of game that the author of PowerKill created.<br/><br/>and for the Wine, certainly we play a second game at the same time as the main game: one that comments on the main game, but never (NEVER!) steals the show. I would look to Brendan Adkins' con-game Rubble as my inspiration... and i would suggest that the Wine is affected by the main game but does not affect back, and that players may only modify the state of the Wine when they are away from the table that the main course is being played at. I'm thinking of a board, thinking of something that can be understood by looking at it. How rich will it be? i don't know. The Wine mustn't be strategic. <br/><br/>Those are my thoughts on the Wine. <br/><br/><br/>Matthijs, i love these ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300114/#Comment_300114" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T13:38:46+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  1:38PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Appetizer - I'd have to say character concept and game theme could be decided before a system was chosen to be the main course.  Perhaps play out a scene and then pick a system to match.  This is also the purest form of story game.<br/><br/>Dessert - Perhaps a Parsley Game to keep everyone involved and laughing.<br/><br/>Beer is more appropriate for pizza, but I'll just answer for alcohol in general.  For something to go with the game - definitely a game of dress up!  Alcohol always leads to some change in outfit status anyway...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300126/#Comment_300126" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T14:07:43+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  2:07PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a roleplaying poem <i>could</i> be considered an appetizer, but a good appetizer will also reveal some of the flavours and concepts that you'll be more deeply exploring in the main course. A good appetizer primes you for the rest of the meal.<br/><br/>And so, character creation, grid creation, pitch sessions... these are appetizers. They give you an appetite for the real meal to follow.<br/><br/>Some appetizers are bold and playful (Spirit of the Century's character creation), some are simple and rely on a creative pairing of a few choice elements (In A Wicked Age's oracle drawings). Some are a buffet of cheeses and crackers and tidbits that you get to pair to create your own tantalizing creations (GURPS character creation).<br/><br/>Sometimes, rather than putting out appetizers <i>per se</i>, you have your guests in the kitchen alongside you, mixing and tasting and spicing and cooking together (Shock:'s grid, PTA's pitch session).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
