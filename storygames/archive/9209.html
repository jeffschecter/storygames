I do, however have plans of creating some character specific books, using lulu (or something similar), adding graphics and making them available to the members.  Some of the characters there, like Soldier Boy, seem to have a decent following.<br/><br/>To clean up a game/story using this type of collaborative story type play, should be very minimal...cuz we try to keep a close tab on editing as we go.  (Sometimes our enthusiasm gets the better of us.)<br/><br/>Interestingly enough though...some of the writers at the site, have asked me about private space to work collaboratively on more formal projects.  I think there is definite potential there as long as you kept your scope/vision narrow.  ...thing with these silly games is that they gain a life of their own sometimes, like a boulder rolling down hill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203776/#Comment_203776" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T22:08:00+00:00" title="April 27, 2009 10:08PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sorcery-Cecelia-Enchanted-Chocolate-Pot/dp/015205300X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1240895114&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">series of YA fantasies</a> that have been written by two collaborators playing the "<a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Letter_game" rel="nofollow">letter game</a>", which I gather involves exchanging letters written in-character to each other's characters, with no collaboration OOC. Not quite an RPG perhaps, but headed in that direction.<br/><br/>I think if you structured this well you could definitely make it work. An <a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Phases/PreviousPhases" rel="nofollow">Amber wiki game</a> that I played in wasn't a million miles from it - we each had our own character and wrote collaboratively, with a GM providing opposition and drawing it together.

Taking turns writing, if you alternate the characters, can take many hours (for synchronous/play-by-chat games) or even a week or more (for asynchronous/play-by-post games) just for one single scene.  So for your first draft, consider a time frame of one to several years, unless all players/writers can play every day for many hours (like I did when I was in college).<br/><br/>And I would think that at the very least, a collaborative story resulting from a game needs as much editing as the first draft of any novel.  Which means someone will have to go in later and do major revisions, merge or split up characters, cut out whole chunks, add subplots, improve the pacing, and so on.  And a lot of that is not just editing as you go (hi and welcome, China, by the way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>, which is mostly grammar and spelling; it's editing a whole thing once you've got the vision of the complete novel.<br/><br/>Still, I would love to see story gaming ideas applied to these kinds of games, something I've been thinking about for a long time.<br/><br/>Mike, how long did that Amber game take you?  What percentage of a "full novel" do you think resulted from that?

To alleviate this I was thinking that one person would write an outline for each scene, giving the gist of what happens and what people say.  Then the individual writers can come in to fill out their part.  Because the outline is there, this can be done with some degree of nonlinearity.  Matching dialogue could still have some issues, but as long as the parts written later match up to those written earlier (even if this doesn't match the chronology in the text) it would work.  Actually, dialogue written in random order could be interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chairman" title="Chairman"><img alt="Chairman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chairman">Chairman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203845/#Comment_203845" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T11:20:06+00:00" title="April 28, 2009 11:20AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that if you kept it small...and had just one or two dedicated collaborators, and a very detailed shared vision, it might go faster that you would expect.<br/><br/>Especially if you used some of the collaborative tools available, that can sneak through security holes at the work place.  I'm continually amazed by how many people do most of their writing while they're suppose to be working.  A lot of wiki sites, google docs, and sites like mine, can sneak through most of those holes.<br/><br/>I think the outline/shared vision is the key...as soon as you turn it into an honest to goodness RPG, where there are no tracks, and each player plays their character.

My wet-finger-in-the-air call is that we had around 60,000 to 80,000 words all up. I could be underestimating dramatically. <br/><br/>There were seven or eight of us, though - not all playing at once, some dropped out and others joined.
