So I got a shock yesterday when I found Skype had 'upgraded' and now group webcam chats are a paid premium service <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>Anyway - I know there's quite a few people who've used Google Hangouts. I had a look, and was impressed by the AV quality - but does anyone know if there's a way to stop people using the Youtube apps, silly hat effects, etc? Specifically is there a way for me as admin to disable those options for my hangout? I find it hard to keep certain members of the group focused at the best of times. Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
