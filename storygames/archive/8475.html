You could have any douchebag skill you wanted, but you'd have to rely on having other players that encourage its use.  If it's an activation-per-use thing you'd be really careful to pick, while if it's an activation-per-session thing the other players would be more careful when activating.<br/><br/>Any merit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188115/#Comment_188115" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T12:46:04+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 12:46PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2009 12:48PM by JCunkle.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>Seems like it could add a layer of decisions that could be pretty much streamlined to a "treshold of credibility" type rule, i.e. allowing anyone to veto a given use of a skill.</blockquote>\nFair enough.  I was thinking along the lines of "veto is stick, permission is a carrot"  I tend to think more along the carrot lines.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>However, I think it would also be possible to have a resolution method that wouldn't require anything like that. All in all, it's a matter of specific resolution procedures, outside the scope of this idea. The assumption is that all the system used would withstand all possible skills, douchebageriffic or not.</blockquote>\nWhat might that look like?  What specific procedures?  Not to sound douchebaggeriffic myself, but just saying "It'll work without it!" doesn't, you know, make it work.  Unless you want to hand wave this part of the conversation?  I'm cool with that, too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>Also, note that once you add a skill to the master list, anyone can take it (though possibly, some restriction for taking skills created by yourself might be in place). Since learning and increasing skills also lets the player add concrete chunks of the world.</blockquote>\nThat's quite true.  I like the idea of someone creating "awesome at everything!"  Then, because it's such a useful skill, and as anybody can take points in it, whole chunks of the world HAVE that skill.  Maybe at a higher level than you. ha.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite> there is also a certain tradeoff between maximizing one's effectiveness in one field and expanding various facets of the setting. I guess it could work better if the cost of improving a skill increased with its level (i.e. you choose between having lots of low-level skills and a lot to say regarding the setting, or a few high-level skills and authoring only a few setting bits).</blockquote>\nOr, if the number of details you provide is determined by skill level.  The better your kung fu gets throughout the game, the more secrets about kung-fu are revealed.  Seems apropriate, if skills indicate gameplay focus.  then the trade off is "more aspects of the setting, or more depth in one"<br/><br/>This is a really neat idea Filip.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
