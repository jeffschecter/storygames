Wrede\u2019s Fantasy World Building Questions (http://www.sfwa.org/2009/08/fantasy-worldbuilding-questions/) and 30 Days of WorldBuilding (http://www.web-writer.net/fantasy/days/index.html).<br/>\nThese are both \u201ctop-down\u201d world building methods (got that from some other world building site), and quite inspirational. HOWEVER, I find myself preferring more scattershot methods. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread has two purposes:<br/>\n1) Having fun with world building.<br/>\n2) Compiling a list of scattershot slash down-up approaches to world building.<br/>\nThe rules for the thread are as follows:<br/>\nPost 5 + challenges/questions/hints to world builders<br/>\nOr<br/>\nAnswer previous challenges. You yourself choose which and how many to answer. You can answer based on a world you\u2019ve made, one you\u2019re working on, or even someone else\u2019s. You can also answer your own challenges. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr<br/>\nDo both.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I might publish the final challenges in some sort of blog post at some point.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some challenges slash slash for starters\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n* Draw a creature from your world and post it here. It can be a character, a monster an NPC or whatever. What the heck, it can be a mountain for all we know. Or a photo from our own world identical to something in yours. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Who\u2019s an outsider in your setting? Why? What does it mean to be an outsider? Limit yourself to 300 words. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Describe something sacred. You can use as many characters as you like, but you\u2019re not allowed to explain anything about the setting\u2019s cosmology directly. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Write three words in one of the languages of your setting. Explain their meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Write five keywords about the mood you wish to convey. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Use at most 1000 characters on a mood piece about your setting. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Show us your map. <br/>\n<br/>\n* In five sentences \u2013 show how religion functions in daily life. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Write a timeline.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Decide upon the one single element in your setting you\u2019re the least happy with. Remove it from the setting description, and tell us afterwards. <br/>\n<br/>\n* What\u2019s the most meager resource in the setting?<br/>\n* Mention three movies/books/comics/RPGs or the like one could be inspired by if one wanted to write/play in your setting. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Find a photo using Google Image Search which matches your setting, and link to it here. <br/>\n* Kill your darlings. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Do a playtest in the setting, no matter how incomplete it might be. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Invite a few friends. Tell them about your setting. Accept their input. Tell us what you\u2019re going to use. <br/>\n<br/>\n* What\u2019s the worst profanity one can use in your setting? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Is there a God?<br/>\n<br/>\n* What on your timeline would you most want to witness as it unfolds?<br/>\n<br/>\n* What on your timeline would you avoid at all costs?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Create a character for any RPG which might fit in with your setting and post it here. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Who would you rather be in your setting?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
