But, now is the time to end Chimera Creative publishing. <br/><br/>At the end of September, 2008, Chimera Creative products will no longer be available on IPR or anywhere. Until then, Dust Devils is on sale for $19.95 with the PDF included. (Some copies of my games exist in retail channels; I have no idea where.)<br/><br/>Currently, the www.chimera.info web site is down due to a mostly unrelated technical glitch! However, it is likely to remain down indefinitely. This means it will be difficult to contact me. Use the following email: <br/><br/>riverwords -at- gmail -dot- com<br/><br/>There is no way to express sufficiently my appreciation, but I will attempt to: <br/><br/><b>Thank you to everyone who played my games. You were the people I wanted to reach. Some of you have told me how much you enjoyed playing my games.

I'm getting lots of questions. To answer some common ones: <br/><br/>1) No, I do not have plans to license my games to anyone. I prefer to own my work, and oversee control of how it gets published. I respect people like Clinton Nixon who release works in creative commons, for example. It's just not what I want to do with my "kids." <br/><br/>2) Yes, this means all publications cease everywhere. No books, no PDFs. Lots of people are urging me to just make them available as PDFs somewhere, or even POD books on Lulu. Currently, that's not what I want to do. I may change my mind once other issues resolve.<br/><br/>3) There are no more Nine Worlds books in stock. It's out of print. I don't have plans to reprint it again.<br/><br/>4) I am not abandoning the hobby of RPGs, and definitely not my many good friends I've met in this hobby. In fact, I hope this will free me up some so I can play more often locally. And, I'll still participate some online. I really like this hobby a lot!<br/><br/>5) I don't have any plans to do layout work for other publishers right now. That is a really great creative outlet, and I miss that part. But it's also a royal pain in the tuckus to work on other people's dime. Actually, more like other people's penny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170719/#Comment_170719" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T12:49:18+00:00" title="September 23, 2008 12:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>4) I am not abandoning the hobby of RPGs, and definitely not my many good friends I've met in this hobby.

But I am talking as someone who already have them (apart from 44...  damn, I was waiting for it from 2006...).  If you were searching for Dust Devils and nobody would sell it to you, and it was on bitTorrent... what would you do? You would download it, or not?<br/><br/>You can't really close the cat into the bag again. Once something get to the net, it stays forever (and not doing pdfs don't help, they have scanners..). The only way we could help Matt limiting this would be stopping playing his games, stop talking about them, and minimizing their importance to history of forge games, to avoid raising the curiosity of new peoples who still don't have them.  It's not a solution I particularly like, and I don't think Matt would like it, too, so I think that it's not a battle worth fighting. People will still find his games somewhere, it's not something anybody can control.<br/><br/>I am worried just now about the OTHER content of his site: the old Dedalus Issues, the Score podcast... what about them? It would be possible to host them elsewhere?

The very connection between audience and provider that leads to questions fueled by entitlement could be reason enough (note, not all questions here are fueled by entitlement and not all entitlement is bad or unreasonable). <br/><br/>In the case of art as system, the artist may want to emotionally disconnect. Having a system, means supporting the system. Supporting the system means staying connected. You could outsource support, but there is effort and a looming question of proper representation. The feeling of do it right or not at all is difficult to abandon. <br/><br/>I can understand the desire for closure. But I guess what I'm saying there are plenty of perfectly valid reasons for anyone to do anything. Maybe it's extremely personal. Maybe it's not. That's Matt's decision.

He's decided for whatever reason he's done with it and he doesn't feel like having his games still available. What's the big deal?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy doesn't he want them available on Lulu? *shrug* Maybe he doesn't feel like having people constantly trying to track him down and request/ask/demand new product be made; maybe he wants to close the door on this particular part of rpgs and actually have the door _shut_; maybe he doesn't feel like cruising forums and reading people say stuff like, "it's a good enough game but it's basically dead"; maybe he doesn't feel like people offering up suggestions on new errata/suggestions for revising his game; and maybe he just wants to go back to being a "gamer" and not always having the niggling little pressure in the back of his head that he should be doing "work" of some sort on a game, since he's a "designer".<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: SquidLord&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while I don't think we&lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt;a reason, I&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;think it's in the best interest of the community, especially the community of creators and potential creators in the audience on SG, that Matt explain his thinking on the matter. In not doing so, it would seem he begs more questions that are troubling from a consumer point-of-view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's bad for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does his decision have _anything_ to do with the "community" of creators and potential creators? He's decided he's done. What, because he's decided to quit, all of a sudden other people are going to decide not to design rpgs? What kind of "troubling questions" are going to be asked by a consumer, other than "why can't I buy this game I'm curious about"?<br/>\n<br/>\nConsumers in general don't give a crap about stuff; if they can't get what they immediately want, they'll simply get something else. A few of them might turn to theft, but the majority of them will simply shrug and run off to make another "sell me" thread and not give a second thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I _really_ don't see how Matt's decision to stop producing games or making them available is "bad for everyone". Nine Worlds is a groovy game. It's the only game of his that I'm familiar with and the only one that's caught my interest. I don't think the small press/indy side of rpgs has suffered because his other games didn't catch my attention, and I doubt that Chimera Creative ceasing to offer its games will cause Evil Hat, Wicked Brewing, and all the others out there to suddenly shut down in solidarity or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPGs are about playing Invisible Barbie. Matt says he's going to be playing Invisible Barbie with folks more, and I think that's a fine thing. As far as I know, being an rpg designer isn't like joining the mob.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171178/#Comment_171178" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T07:29:15+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  7:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Down here in Alabama, we take our RPGs pretty seriously. We think of them and their emergent fiction as Art. Capital A. Maybe that's because in our group everyone is an artist, writer, musician or some combination of the three. I take my fiction pretty seriously and see the fiction emerging from the games I participate in as being pretty important. I don't like reading crap escapist novels, I don't like watching crap escapist television or movies, and I don't want crap escapist gaming sessions. So for me RPGs aren't about playing Invisible Barbie.<br><br>It's Matt's choice to do as he pleases with his games, but I am of the opinion that once an artist has completed a work, it is no longer his, but belongs to our collective cultural heritage. I'm talking here of Art with a capital A, which may or may not be a commercial product. I live by this with my own art and music, which I give away for free whenever possible. I find this is more "punk" than creator ownership.<br><br>I've never played Matt's games, but from the comments I've read they're pretty important and influential. I don't know whether they are Art or not. Maybe they're bigger than Matt realizes.

Get a Fundable page up!  Pull a KLF.<br/><br/>I will also echo the sentiments of some other in this thread: I might not entirely understand your logic in deciding not to make the games available at all (although I can certainly dig not wanting the hassle of faffing about with print runs and whatnot), but at the end of the day that's your call mate.  DD was the first "Story" game I ever bought (the first of many) and also the first PDF I ever bought (again, the first of many) way back in 2002/3.  I'm bummed that I never quite got around to picking up Nine Worlds.  We'll see if one turns up somewhere sometime.<br/><br/>I'm also bummed that you stopped using that photo of Malcolm's knob as your avatar, but that's another, unrelated matter.<br/><br/>Rich                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171195/#Comment_171195" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T08:30:41+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  8:30AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2008 8:34AM by chearns.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>But it's not going to stop people from getting their hands on and playing the game.

Matt has requested that the Chimera Creative forum at The Forge be shut down. Matt's a really good guy from what I can tell with my limited contact with him here and elsewhere on the Internet, and that plus the shutting down of the forum lead me to believe that Matt feels a responsibility to provide support for people who purchase and wish to play games he created. If he's not looking to provide that support, then it could be that's why he doesn't want to sell those games. Even as PDFs.<br/><br/>However, that's just one guess, and if I sat here long enough, I could probably come up with an infinite number of reasons for his decisions. As could any of you. So, please, no bullshit about how his decisions were wrong, or irrational. Or about how his silence on this issue is bad for the community or troubling for consumers. Seriously, be grateful for what you have.<br/><br/>EDIT: Crikey, but I used the word Matt a lot in that first paragraph. I also feel fucking stupid talking about you Matt as if you aren't even in this thread with us. I mean, you're shutting down Chimera Creative, not dying. My dream of one day playing with you, the guy who introduced me to the Western (Unforgiven is incredible (seriously, I was transfixed right up until the end of the credits) and those Leone films are really good too), is still alive and well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171201/#Comment_171201" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T09:04:13+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:04AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is too much mournful.

It's like a story. We all prefer to have a sense of closure at the end of the story. Will they live happily ever after? Will he get the girl? Will he avenge his faithful cat? It's not... natural for a story to stop abruptly like this.

I won an award, I was a golden boy. Then fashions and trends in RPGs shifted, as they do from time to time, and suddenly I was the devil. I was accused of being a child molester (seriously, not as a random flame), of deliberately trying to ruin the game and the company, and a million other things. At the same time the company, for reasons having nothing to do with me, was in some lean times. So they refused to pay me for work owed. When I insisted and pointed out I had lawyers in the family, they dragged their feet, flamed me online, and insinuated to the fan forums that I was hurting the company. <br/><br/>This, you can probably guess, didn't make me do leaping jumps of fucking joy. So I stopped writing for the game or working with the company. My mistake was that I didn't really quit, I said "no more for now." And I stayed on the fan forum, and I kept answering questions from folks about stuff I'd written. And for six fucking months solid I got hatemail in my inbox every day. (Seen Vincent's hate mail? Like that but less funny.) And for a year I'd get occasional querries from the company about if I would do some more work for them. And sometimes I almost agreed. Once I did agree, and then the project got shitcaned after I'd written 25,000 words for it, and of course I didn't get paid. <br/><br/>For that whole time I was irritable, I was edgy, I was a pain in the ass online. I didn't write a thing worth shit for the whole year because my energy was being sucked away by this thing I'd done and that was now a fucking albatross around my fucking neck. People from the community owned my ass because I wasn't letting go, they talked like the deserved something and I fucking let that get at me. <br/><br/>So then I fucking quit. I quit playing the game. I quit writing for the game. I quit talking to people about the game online. I quit talking to the company in any way. I fucking quit, full fucking stop. <br/><br/>In a single day, once I let go and closed down everything, I felt better about myself.  In a month I was writing good shit again. In a year I was doing some of the best work I ever did. Two years later I was able to play the game again without bitterness. <br/><br/>Now, obviously some of this is all about the trad-game evil (yay, I'm a real story gamer talking about the trad game evil!) -- but some of it is not. When you create things into a community and are part of that community the desires of the community, the desire to support your work, the desire to help and talk with folks in the community about what you created is fucking MASSIVE. And sometimes its fucking wonderful, like taking a hit of cocain. And sometimes its fucking terrible, like taking a hit of cocain. And sometimes to get off it, you have to go cold fucking turkey. <br/><br/>No, keeping another hit in a drawer in the basement where it will be "hassle free" doesn't fucking work. You quit, you just quit. You don't keep a hit in the drawer in case, you don't keep a book up on Lulu because it won't cause you hassle. In this situation, it will. And saying "no it won't, I don't see why it would" doesn't mean that it won't, it just shows that you're not in a position to get it. <br/><br/>Is that's whats up with Matt? No fucking clue. Could be, could be something else. And it and all the others are rational, emotionally healthy reasons. Just because our life experience hasn't put us in a place to understand it, doesn't mean its fake punk, irrational, disrespectful, or anything like that. It just means that they're Matt's reasons and not ours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171346/#Comment_171346" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T16:54:23+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  4:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Who's the 'someone' in your statement, Jason?

Like, for instance, the decision to spend their time and money in producing a role-playing game, rather than starting a trans-pacific investing corporation, which generally yields more cash.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Which may be so, but when it costs nothing to have the work out there and to choose to not support it, merely to keep it in inventories and accessible, then it's not a question about the bottom line. It's a long, long way from questions about the bottom line. The latte's a pleasant extra. What it <em>is</em> becomes an issue of "why do you feel the necessity of cutting off the people who think your work is worth looking at?" In a sense, it's a weak slap at those who come in later but have interest and motivation to examine the work. It says to them, "too bad, you missed it when the piece was live and now I can't be bothered with you."</p>\n<p>Seriously, in the Olden Days, when it cost actual money to move and print physical products and to maintain fora for cash, when your fandom couldn't be self-supporting when you as creator moved on, it made perfect sense to let things go out of print and be inaccessible. But those days aren't today and <em>particularly</em> in the indie RPG world, there's wide awareness of how little investment it takes to make an object effectively immortal: none. Throw it up on Archive.org, leave a free web page somewhere explaining that you're no longer providing support for the product and have moved on as a creator and, out of appreciation for the fact that someone would look for it, link to a forum where discussion can be found with other people who have interest, and then proceed to move on with your life having satisfied both yourself and the community of people who think enough of something you've made with your own hands to experience it.</p>\n<p><em>That's</em> really what confuses me here, and no amount of decrying me as seeming entitled as others have done in this thread changes the fact that I simply do not understand why someone who has produced a piece of work that they care about and that others care about and could care about in the future wants to deliberately take it off the table, when leaving it there with benign negligence costs them nothing in money, time, or reputation and removing it gains them nothing at all. I don't understand and so I ask, for explication and for understanding.</p>\n<p>At heart in many ways I'm an archivist and librarian. The world has lost a lot of what many might consider epherma which, nevertheless, indicated things about what people thought and enjoyed and valued. When the digital world began to take form, I was pleased and gladdened, because I thought that it would become easier and cheaper to capture not only epherma but things of even more import. When people deliberately choose to avoid joining that movement, when they deliberately act to remove things which are of historical import (and, believe it or not, in the field of interactive game design <strong>Dust Devils</strong> <em>is</em> a creation of historical import, just as <strong>Bliss Stage</strong> is), I want to know why. I don't think I'm entitled to, I just want to. I <em>am</em> entitled to the question.</p>\n<p>Matt is under no compulsion to answer. But it'd be good to, if only so his audience, the people who do care about his work and it's accessibility, consumers and fellow travellers, have some sense of why this particular choice has been made.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171376/#Comment_171376" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T21:03:03+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:03PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Matt.  <br/><br/>I just wanted to pop in and say that I love your games.

Total "investment" by Matt henceforth: zero. Return: greater than zero. If I had an investment portfolio which required no input of effort or money and even trickled back $2 a month, I'd consider myself lucky.<br/><br/>No, I am not arguing from a sense of my own entitlement (I'm not entitled... and I've already bought the game I am interested in, so I'm all-good). No, I do not accept the "it can become a drain" argument, because my basic premise is that it would be fire and forget (i.e. any reply or anecdote about 'the agony of an eternal project" is begging the question). I'm just talking availability, steady profit, and the basic notion that a seminal work of art shouldn't be effectively destroyed (frex, what would the world be like if, say, the Mona Lisa original was lost, only a few hundred prints were ever made, and then the very plates or source of prints was then destroyed?).<br/><br/>Option A (stop everything) deprives the market, historians and students, and even the creator (steady, minor trickle of income).<br/>Option B (Lulu and forget about it) keeps it available to newcomers (fairly steady trickle of THEM, wouldn't you say?) and students of the art, while providing a steady trickle of income for zero effort.<br/><br/>If Monty Hall gave me them two doors, I'm 110% certain which I'd choose. So, Matt,  could you explain to me--out of courtesy, to satisfy my idle curiosity; you're certainly not required to remove my bafflement--why Option A is preferable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171450/#Comment_171450" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T08:26:58+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  8:26AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David">@David</a>: it _IS_ true, though, that there are many cases of works of art made with a 'repeatable' medium (say, an etched print) where X number of copies are made, and the original is then destroyed.

Meaning, its not really available as an Indie product, if he is not supporting it with his forum, feedback, etc.<br/>\n  And that is a big commitment. A lot of people perceive DD and others as perfect examples of an Indie product. So, he would be doing himself, his product and the indie community a disservice to plop the product out there and then ignore it.<br/>\n  That is just an assumption, but it is the only one that makes sense to me.

He sold some things. He owns those things. Making and selling and owning are different. He still wants to own them, but he doesn't want to make more things or sell more things. Selling things is a pain in the ass, for lots of reasons, and the benefits of the money you earn don't always outweigh the pains of being a seller. <br/><br/>1. You are not entitled to Matt's stuff unless you already paid for it. This means you aren't entitled to make Matt keep selling it, and you sure as hell are not entitled to steal it off the internet. His intellectual property is not, as Brennen put it, part of the "collective cultural heritage." The experiences you had playing his games may be, but his actual property is not. If you paint a gorgeous painting, show it, and it gets really famous, then you retire and take your painting home, that doesn't give everyone in the world the right to give away free reproductions of it or use it to sell diapers on tv. <br/><br/>2. You are not entitled to Matt's discussion. Seriously, are people arguing that because he made an announcement, he is somehow beholden to answer everyone's questions about everything, and justify his choices? I thought Matt graciously answered questions early in the thread. Haranguing him further is pretty rude.<br/><br/>Anyway, man, Matt posted to let us know he was getting out and even shared his reasons why. Let's give him a break, thank him for his creative work, and let go.<br/><br/>Matt, see ya soon, I hope. I don't think I've ever gotten to play a game of anything with you. Now maybe that will change!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172637/#Comment_172637" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T11:27:37+00:00" title="October  2, 2008 11:27AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuck it. <br/><br/>I've never played a single game that Matt's made. It's not that I've not been interested, it just hasn't happened. I met the guy for the first time at GenCon 08, where I roomed with him. I didn't see too much of him, and didn't game even once with him. Still, he seems like a cool guy. <br/><br/>The above is an attempt to establish that I have no feelings of betrayal or resentment or entitlement or loss. <br/><br/>All the same, I've been reading this thread (or at least skimming it) hoping that Matt would elaborate. <br/><br/>All I'm feeling is a vague sense of wistfulness. I've never played one of these games. Now I'll probably never own one. Ah well. <br/><br/>I'm also feeling a nagging bafflement. Why, Matt? You touched briefly on your reasons, but I don't understand them. I'm not a successful, well-known game designer, so I've no inkling of the reason why anyone who could stay in the "industry" with no additional costs or necessity for attention would shut down publication. I feel like there's a lesson to be learned in the elaboration of the reasons, and I was hoping you'd share your reasons in more detail than you did. <br/><br/>Of course you don't have to. The amount of times that this has been stated makes my saying so another kick to the proverbial dead horse. But I'd appreciate it if you did. If you already have elsewhere, it'd be cool to know that too. I could probably find it on my own, if I knew there was something to look for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172657/#Comment_172657" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T13:11:48+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  1:11PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *sigh*  i didn't want to bring this up, and last time i successful suppressed the urge to do so, but thanks to Adam, I'm going to.<br/><br/>the standard argument against piracy of digital works of any sort is that it would detract from legitimate sales.  one of (if not THE) original purpose of copyright law was to ensure that artists and creators would be paid for what they produced.<br/>so, if, when someone has decided to cease all sales of something, whats the argument against piracy of digital copies of the work?  there are no longer any sales to be lost.  nothing is being "stolen" from the creator.  the creator still has everything he ever had.  his or her "loss" at this point is that more people are experiencing the creation.  and if the argument at this point is that the creator should control all aspects of the work he or she created, well that is simply absurd.  does the creator also have the right to tell people with physical copies of the work that they cannot show it or loan it to anyone?<br/><br/>i'm not making any statements about "entitlement" or any of that garbage.  i'm not making any moral statements at all, about what is "right" or "wrong" or "acceptable."  but what i am saying is that once anyone creates anything and publishes it in any form whatsoever, control will be lost.  the only way to maintain complete control over something is to never let it out of your grip.<br/><br/>i kept my nouns and pronouns in the general very intentionally.  none of this is specifically directed at Matt or his decision.
