I'm posting for three things: an introduction and two writing projects.<br/><br/>My name is Richard S. Hetley, and I'm a writer/game designer at <a href="http://www.megara-entertainment.com" rel="nofollow">Megara Entertainment</a>.  We've worked to take classic gamebooks and adapt them to new formats--these are what would be called "Choose Your Own Adventure" books if that weren't a copyrighted term.  (I searched for "gamebook" on this forum and found mixed use, so I thought I'd better be explicit.)  We've had fun in the playgrounds created by Lone Wolf (briefly), Fabled Lands, Fighting Fantasy (The Keep of the Lich-Lord), and The Way of the Tiger.<br/><br/>One current project is The Way of the Tiger.  We are turning the gamebooks into an RPG, and we have plenty up in the air.<br/><br/>For our other project, we are going backwards from all this "gamebook adaptation."  We are running a Kickstarter for an original gamebook in print, Arcana Agency: The Thief of Memories.<br/><br/>Now, I don't want to sound like I'm just advertizing our company/Kickstarter when I'd like to talk with people who actually have opinions on gamebooks.  How should I proceed?  Even if no one backs us, I still want input on both projects.  Until I know I'm not stepping on toes I'll just list some points:<br/><br/>The Way of the Tiger (<a href="http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=469" rel="nofollow">reference</a>).  Design goals include incorporating the gamebooks' massive, active pantheon into play.  Character classes are dedicated to gods, thus class impacts not just skills but social role.  Other writers have been handling the gods; my personal work has been in scouring the source material for all items and creatures that make the world what it is.<br/><br/>Arcana Agency: The Thief of Memories (<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1615043334/arcana-agency-the-thief-of-memories-a-full-color-g" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a>).  It is written in third person instead of second person.  I don't personally hold with the idea that second person is terrible; for us, we use this to have the player control multiple characters at once.  A goal was to take advantage of the medium, doing tricks like "Go to the page number that matches the combination on this lock," which cannot be done in videogames.<br/><br/>If you have any thoughts, suggestions, or questions on the above, please toss them at me.  Thanks for lending me your ear!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396310/#Comment_396310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T04:35:31+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  4:35AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see descriptions of how you are converting setting and characters for The Way of the Tiger, but how will you address the GM side of the coin?

Our fellow team member Marcus Smith brought up the same issue, and I'll expand on what he said:<br/><br/>There are already 4 mechanics systems in print for this game world: The Way of the Tiger, Fighting Fantasy (Talisman of Death is in the same world), Falcon (Lost in Time), and Duelmaster (Arena of Death).  Thus, as you say, the most important thing is that it FEEL like it belongs, because it will never be identical.<br/><br/>So, The Way of the Tiger's basic mechanic is "roll two dice, add a modifier, beat a target."  That's our basic mechanic. Everything else is about getting it to feel right: letting the game world (and experience) define the game mechanics.<br/><br/>In the original, you played a ninja who could punch out an Elder God, and each new adventure brought new horrors from the depths of the GM's (authors') imagination.  The ninja cared about the mission, not the money (for book after book, you literally could not spend all your money).  Okay then:<br/><br/>Here, we minimize gold rewards and abstract a lot of shopping (I can explain more if you'd like).  The GM gets creatures that are fought more one-on-one than in huge mobs to slaughter.  We create powers for the classes (and monsters) directly from what they did in the gamebooks.  Hopefully, it feels more like the sequence of play you get in a gamebook than the hack-and-slash of a videogame.<br/><br/>Are there other dimensions of GMing and play I could be addressing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396478/#Comment_396478" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T17:19:02+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  5:19PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think make it 'were not just here to do your main quest' - have side objectives the players may choose to help with or decide doesn't deserve their help. And have an epilogue page at the end, describing the ongoing result of player choices in regards to those areas, one for if they were helped, another for if they weren't.<br/><br/>Sometimes such side epilogue endings become the main ending for the player. It lets their own emphasis on what was the big deal of play have some room to move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sir_Knight" title="Sir_Knight"><img alt="Sir_Knight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nJ5F4CQNLJE3E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sir_Knight">Sir_Knight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396577/#Comment_396577" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T09:37:01+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  9:37AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great.  But I'm not sure what you're addressing: is this an answer to the question of "being faithful to a gamebook while designing the GM experience," or just a suggestion for an enriching game?  Because most gamebooks aren't set up like that.  You have your choice of route, but the route has fixed points which must happen in order for the main plot to unfold: there's a clear target for the adventure.  (At a minimum, each of the print books back in the 80's had to set up the next book.)<br/><br/>Further, are you just suggesting how we prepare a sample campaign, or an explicit mechanic that we can instruct our future audience how to do?  When doing our sample campaign, I can certainly suggest we write extra "and this happened thanks to you" sections at the end.  It might be turned down, though: in the original, you didn't have the omniscient power to know what happened three cities ago (you were almost always traveling huge distances on one-way trips).  If it's a mechanic for a future GM, what would we say?  How would we encourage it, place "value" in it, et cetera?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sir_Knight" title="Sir_Knight"><img alt="Sir_Knight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nJ5F4CQNLJE3E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sir_Knight">Sir_Knight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399825/#Comment_399825" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T11:33:05+00:00" title="December  6, 2012 11:33AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello again.  I don't wish to sound crass and commercial, but discussion seems to have died off after I made my reply here, so I have to come out of left field with an update on the timed matter: our Kickstarter project, Arcana Agency: The Thief of Memories.<br/><br/>We are more than halfway to our funding goal and we have one week left.  The project has received kind words from gamebook authors <a href="http://fabledlands.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-thief-of-memories.html" rel="nofollow">Dave Morris</a> and <a href="http://virtualfantasies.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/arcana-agency-preview-case-of-unghostly.html" rel="nofollow">Stuart Lloyd</a>, with mentions from <a href="http://jonathangreenauthor.blogspot.com/2012/11/gamebook-friday-arcana-agency-thief-of.html" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Green</a> and <a href="http://herbiebrennansbookshelfblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/fantastic-new-gamebook-project.html" rel="nofollow">Herbie Brennan</a> (and also <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/breadpig/to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-adventure" rel="nofollow">Ryan North</a>, briefly, while he does his own gamebook).<br/><br/>There has been a review on a new site called <a href="http://www.tabletested.com/Table_Tested/Thief_of_Memories.html" rel="nofollow">Table Tested</a>.  And though the book stands on its own merits, <a href="http://www.campaignmastery.com/blog/the-color-of-pulp" rel="nofollow">the Campaign Mastery blog</a> reviewed the project as a gaming aide for roleplaying in general.  That one was interesting: the author there took the project and viewed it through the angle of his own website, namely, taking our illustrations to inspire ideas for his own roleplaying campaigns.<br/><br/>The project is almost done, so any attention from you folks would be greatly appreciated.  Your words would be helpful, and of course those who were interested in holding a new solo RPG in their hands might consider <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1615043334/arcana-agency-the-thief-of-memories-a-full-color-g" rel="nofollow">backing it</a>.
