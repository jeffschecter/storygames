We weren't able to give it a lot of time (2 hours), and of the three of us, only two had time to be the Lens.  We enjoyed it, and would like to revisit it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- The book is very clear, and the tips for play very helpful.  I had read it only once, but was able to march us through the rules without much trouble.<br/><br/>- No one had trouble making contributions, and I think we did a good job of keeping our mouths shut when it was someone else's turn to contribute.  It helps that there were only three of us, and we're usually good at sharing our ideas without being domineering.  <br/><br/>- I love world-building, and epxloration/discovery, and the game scratched that itch admirably.<br/><br/>- Playing the role of Time was a lot more fun than it sounded in the book.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- It's not very gamey, but since that's not the point, it's not really a con.  <br/><br/>- The book is very dry, but I know that was a conscious choice.  It worked for me, but I hope that won't turn people off.<br/><br/>-  The Legacies felt a little tacked-on to me; possibly we did not play long enough to appreciate them.<br/><br/>- This is more about me than the game: I had a tendency to forget what the focus should be, even when I was the Lens.  Next time, I'd probably write it on a sheet in big letters.<br/><br/><br/>AP: since we were playing in lieu of AW, and were in a goofy mood, we wound up with a conflict between two alien races, the Skinners (spiritual centaurrine canines with toadish heads), and the Gunluggers (nasty, bat-winged invaders who believe people can be property), who we learned could actually interbreed, creating a third group called the Skinluggers.  Most of the play focused on the three tine points: the first tragic contact, when the Skinners choose to meet aggression with peace, and Gunluggers took full advantage; the occupation, where we learn the races can crossbreed; and the later civil rights movement for the Skinluggers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323115/#Comment_323115" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T16:24:45+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  4:24PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm at the pre-play stage: reading, prepping and thinking about it. Moderate me away, Andy, if that's too soon  to be posting here. <br/><br/>Joe, I also felt like the text was very clear. I hadn't thought of it as dry, though I suppose the tone is simply direct, with the most colour coming through in the discussion sections at the end. I'm very impressed with the organization of it: clear overview, step by step discussion of rules, tips and sharing the reasoning behind things, as well as discussing some more advanced or complicated implications of certain rules. And then, a section on how to teach the game. Brilliant. I don't know if I will in fact read out loud those sections, but it is good to know they are there, and I am certain those will be used by some groups. <br/><br/>I'm planning on making a couple of reference sheets for me to turn to: things I had questions on when reading the book, more advanced applications or things that seem important but would be easy to overlook. The reference sheet in the book has a good overview of most of the parts of the game. I've thought about bringing index cards of varying colors to use for the events, periods etc. (stole that from a local gm--hi Jim!--who did that in Fiasco), and a sheet of paper for folks to keep notes about characters. <br/><br/>And one of the parts that I admire the most and wonder how it will go over, is the admonition to not comment, suggest or kibbitz when it is someone's turn to create an element. The reasons for this are compelling: allowing discussion puts the story into a committee's control, which can drain tension and take away a real element of surprise. Also, the real world issue of conversation dominance! I've seen this happen in conversations as well as games, and as a quiet person I appreciate it! This is a technique used in feminist and egalitarian group design: to have the group be sure to hear equally from all voices. <br/><br/>More when we get to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323125/#Comment_323125" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T17:38:38+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  5:38PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm looking forward to playing it again, because I played it "wrong" the first time - I was trying to build consensus, create-by-committee, saying "How about X?" instead of "X happened" - which the rules specifically say not to do - I'm looking forward to seeing what happens when I play more decisively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323144/#Comment_323144" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T20:31:42+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  8:31PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>I'm at the pre-play stage: reading, prepping and thinking about it.

No "asking the group what they think might be cool here", and no asking for that from the group, either."<br/><br/>I was like "Whaaa......?" Thinking that that's pretty much the opposite for most of the time I play (especially focused hippie stuff). Then I started thinking about why that was there and emphasized so much, and sure enough it seemed like a brilliant move for the game. It wasn't a stance of "consensus simply waters down the game into a tasteless gruel that everyone can barely palate but is not all that great", but rather "For THIS game, you NEED to do this," In short, the decisive, no-feedback narration and declaration is almost as much a randomizer as a handful of dice: You don't know and can't control what happens until <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the random dice hit the table and you look at the result, which may be different from what you were expecting</span> the person narrating declares the result, which is likely very different than you were expecting. I really like how that works here, and it seems a tight, solid fit with the even (fair) turn-taking nature of the rules: Everyone gets their say in the end, and not just the loudest.<br/><br/>It might be hard for us PTA Generation to shut off that part of our toolkit that says "Hey, just ask for feedback! Or just throw down your own feedback!" But it seems that you need to to have all the other turn-taking and setting generation rules work.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323238/#Comment_323238" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T13:27:14+00:00" title="May  5, 2011  1:27PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Emily: we didn't really feel that the story was complete after a four hour con session, but more so when we allowed ourselves to tie all the periods together and actually say that this period here is brought into being by the very same person that was president back here, as he puts his son on the job etc. The players in one group, where we'd done the alternate american history from 1600 forwards, said afterwards that to him, it had felt like all the periods were within a hundred years or so - a period needed only be a year or something with a distinct feel to it to be a period.<br/><br/>However, I completely understand the rule when it comes to multi-session play. I've never even gotten that far yet because I like introducing this game to people and have trouble getting the exact same people together again, but I have at least two histories that I'd love to return to, since there are so many blanks on so  many levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323241/#Comment_323241" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T14:34:11+00:00" title="May  5, 2011  2:34PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is completion of a story really a feature of the game?

I got the game a month ago but we didn't get a chance to try it until today, for a session of about two hours (I didn't think to time it exactly).  A couple of impressions:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game book was not only easy for me to read originally, but so clear and concise that when I was trying to explain it, I found myself just reading passages aloud.  Also well organized, so that even though I read it a month ago, I found it easy to flip ahead to find more details on the sections we needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't realize ahead of time how useful Focus would be.  Both before and during play I was inevitably comparing the game to Universalis, which I've had both good and bad experiences with.  Most of the bad ones came out of the freeze that happens when you need to think of the next scene but have no ideas, so everyone ends up staring at each other and the session withers.  Here, I knew that my next contribution needed to relate to the reign of Ashubanipal the Dragonslayer, but it was totally fine for me not to know what happened right after the First Killing--I could skip ahead and put an event for the death of his ancestor cult in the period of Blood Sacrifices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not my favorite part, though.  My favorite part was how our third player (who did freeze in Universalis) went quiet on his turn, and I thought the game wasn't going to work for us after all... Then he slapped down an event about how Ashubanipal began to hear the spirit of the dead dragon whispering, telling him how to craft its scales into metal armor to take on its power.  And my husband said "oh shit, that means he's also the first alchemist," which tied things ahead to a future period.  IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.  We only got through one complete Lens turn, and we didn't actually have any played scenes (though one dictated).  I'm still a little skeptical/worried about how those will work out.  But I went into the session not sure anyone else would like it, and expecting it to be a one-off, and we all came out agreeing that we want to do more next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could write a full AP thread, but there are plenty of those at this point.  The short version is that it exceeded my expectations, and I'm psyched to fill in more next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
