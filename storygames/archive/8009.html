Like so:\n<ul>\n<li>Abilities are rolled in 3d6 in order, Ability bonuses are calculated by deducting 10. Abilities are improved organically by use, not by getting levels. They can go down, too, as a consequence of play. In other words, the players can't really strategize this part of character efficiency any more than the character himself can.</li>\n<li>Character classes will be interpreted as strictly martial specializations with negligible in-setting cultural meaning attached to them, while any non-combat facets of the characters will be dealt with in a classless environment. Practically this means removing the class-based restrictions on skills and character backgrounds and such. Your character is composed of his martial facet - the character class - and the rest, which will be dealt with in complete detachment. Probably so much so that experience points will only be used to improve the martial side, while skills and any other non-combat features will develop organically based on use.</li>\n<li>The balanced encounters and pre-calculated treasure packages are going out - characters encounter all sorts of creatures, enemies and friends and others, and it's up to them to decide whether the fight or avoid combat on a case-by-case basis. Treasures are likewise encountered based on setting logic, with only in-setting correlation between treasure and danger. Experience will be gained pretty much by the book - from participating in combat, encountering other dangers and fulfilling quests. Players get to set their own quests, although perhaps there'd be some limitations based on Wisdom checks or whatnot just to make it interesting.</li>\n<li>Encounters themselves are not prebuilt, but developed on the spot based on the tactical approach the characters choose to take in a given situation. The GM goes to some pains to offer asymmetric warfare, alternative and secondary goals and all that other stuff the 4th edition is so sadly lacking with its kill-or-be-killed-never-surrender combat paradigm. Obviously I'd need to develop some real procedures for breaking off encounters, negotiation and NPC morale; the stuff in the rulebook is just awful for dealing with an escaping enemy who the characters decide to chase, for example.</li>\n<li>The real reward cycles, after I'd have finished messing with the rules, would focus on in-setting achievement and, secondarily, character history (expressed in part by the growing xp count). In other words, the rewards come mostly in the form of satisfaction for getting to play the hero who by his own courage and guts saved this town, slew this dragon or whatever it is the adventurers concern. Rich and influential characters get to have their say in larger-scale issues in their community as their position solidifies. And even if the character loses it all in political scheming and has to leave on the road as the king of a lost kingdom, that's just more cool stuff for the character's legend, so the player is still basically happy.</li>\n<li>No idea off-hand how I'd handle character death. My first instinct would be to have the player start with a new character from the 1st level, but I suspect that the 4th edition combat rules would make that basically unfeasible. Probably I'd have to settle on having the new character start from one level below the lowest level in the party. As I would have separate xp counts for all characters (another different to how 4th edition works), they'd be somewhat all over the map in this regard anyway.</li>\n<li>The setting would take everything the rules produce in terms of fictional effects completely seriously. If, as the rules have it, a first level warlock really can show you stars that make you go insane, then the setting and NPCs will be built to take this into account with some semblance of faithfullness towards the nature of humanity. Likewise the role of monstrous humanoids and such - I've always found the cosmic modern D&amp;D fantasy a bit wacky in how carelessly miracles are thrown about without anybody really making a big deal of it. Probably I'd end up removing the whole faux-medieval paradigm and replacing it with something much weirder to account for the social impact of monsters, magic and all the other stuff that's so common to D&amp;D. Alternatively, I'd go all Exalted and just assume the player characters are basically the only PC-classed people in the entire world - their adventures are the first time instant transdimensional summoning magic has impacted upon the world, for instance, so the culture has never really had to adapt to vulgar magical displays of the sort that are a matter of course for D&amp;D. This latter option would probably work better for heroic fantasy purposes.</li>\n</ul>\nSo basically it'd be just like my current primitive D&amp;D campaign, only with the 4th edition combat rules system attached.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176954/#Comment_176954" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T23:44:27+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:44PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing 4E pretty steadily for a while.

I try to keep every rule we use as accessible as possible.  Every power, magic item, environmental DC, special rule, or monster in our game goes on a laminated card for easy all-table reference, so I never have to explain a DC more than once.  And my monsters generally don't stick around encounters that they're losing.  They run (or beg!) for their lives when the outcome seems inevitable, which sometimes leads to a fun pursuit or interrogation endgame.  The bloodied mechanic is useful here.\n<blockquote>And skill challenges as is don't work....something time based with concrete obstacles, gradated results, and mini consequences for failure.</blockquote>\nYeah, the SC RaW do kinda suck.  I wish they included complications, crises, sub-failures and sub-successes, that kind of stuff.

I'm trying to use its RaW* with a <i>Beast Hunters</i> Challenger philosophy, throwing tough stuff at the party, stuff calibrated to be just a hair too difficult for them to accomplish, so that they will look especially cool when they beat it.  And I'm trying to push high stakes in the fiction, harping hard on the points of light thing and on the idea that the PCs are the only thing that can keep those lights lit.  I'm not going all Eero on them and making them be the only heroes in the world, but they're certainly the only heroes in their zip code.<br><br>I'm also trying my best to make those difficult encounters epic and interesting.  <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=173898" rel="nofollow">Andy's recent event scripting card idea kinda blew my mind</a>.  From my PoV, the really neat thing about scripting is that it lets me run encounters that are way more complicated than usual, since I can embed the details in the script and just execute them when they arise.  I love encounters with dynamic terrain and complicated victory conditions, but just maneuvering monsters intelligently requires a lot of focus, so sometimes I lose track of the other stuff I want to do.  <br/><br/>So, our most recent D&amp;D session became Scripting Experiment Alpha.  In the fiction, a secret Orcus cult spun up a ritual that animated an army of zombie minions from the Winterhaven graveyard and sent them howling at the helpless civilians.  The players were required to fight a desperate defensive battle to save the town.<br/><br/>I scripted the encounter on a stack of 60 pre-ordered event cards.  I openly drew one on initiatives 15, 8, and 1 of every round.  Each card contained the complete rules for resolving its action, so if any players had any questions about how they worked, they could just read the card.  <br/><br/>Every third card was a Spawn card -- a pit would be blown into a random part of the battlemap and four zombie minions spawned within it.  Every twelfth card was a Casualty card.  Any zombies that had left the graveyard would inflict casualties on Winterhaven.  If the town lost a certain number of casualties, it would fall.  <br/><br/>(The zombie minions moved by strict rules that I printed on another card -- they'd move to engage the closest good guy within four squares, or would double-run towards the gate otherwise.  These rules allowed the players to help me DM, moving the minions whose choices were obvious.)<br/><br/>Other event cards spawned ally militia minions on the map, made everyone save vs. falling down, knocked over some of the big graveyard statues, created NPC rescue objectives (with big XP rewards), churned treasure parcels onto the map from the graves underneath, made fires spread, and a host of other stuff.  My goal was to use the shiny to distract the PCs from dealing with the zombie minions, while being fair and explicit about how they were the real threat to Winterhaven.  Even the big well-guarded foozle that the ritual had spawned in the crypt was kind of a distraction, as killing it would only stop zombies from spawning, and not escaping.<br/><br/>The cards also served as a time counter for the encounter, as I'd decided that after the 60 draws / 20 rounds, the ritual would run out of power and the zombies would crap out.<br/><br/>The players did really well at the encounter.  Before any casualty cards came up, the warlord immediately understood that the zombies needed to be contained, and he led the fighter and some faceless NPCs on an effort to barricade the graveyard gates.  The fighter covered the work party with his lightning axe while the warlord kept his men working at the Harper continuing-damage type skill challenge I improvised to cover the situation.<br/><br/>Inside the graveyard, the wizard, ranger, and cleric backstopped the defence, mowing down zombies in job lots as they shambled towards the only other exit.  The party spread itself all over my big 3'x5' battlemap -- I think the ranger visited every corner of it as he rescued NPCs, took charge of militiamen, and scouted the big boss.  There was lots of motion and jumping and braving flaming squares; at one point the cleric was zeroed in a flaming square and the warlord had to break out of the boss fight and dash over to drag him to safety.   Two of the NPCs were rescued and two were not -- both of the nonrescued ones died when pits opened suddenly underneath them, which provoked grim laughter.  And there was a tense moment when a falling statue threatened the barricaded gate.  The statues fall in a random direction when their cards come up, and luckily for the PCs, the statue fell away from the gate.<br/><br/>In the end, Winterhaven suffered nothing close to the defeat casualty threshold.  The town was saved, the victory celebrations ran long into the night, and the warlord scored some XP for his "I will lead a company of renown!" personal quest.   I had a lot of fun and there was some positive post-play chatter.<br/><br/>* one houserule: we use action points as rerolls, so missing on your daily isn't such a downer.  I'm pretty sure that's our only houserule.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
