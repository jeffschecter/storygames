The paladin might be an exception for some version's of D&amp;D, because if a paladin "breaks" alignment, s/he loses in-game abilities.<br/><br/>In Vampire, you have Humanity. Lose too much and your character becomes a monster, effectively an NPC, so there is a mechanical reason to try to keep or regain Humanity.<br/><br/>I also would argue The Shadow of Yesterday has ethics hard-coded into gameplay through Secrets and Keys, because these reward certain kinds of gameplay while having benefits and penalties to buying off those traits.<br/><br/>What other games do these sorts of things?<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227133/#Comment_227133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T08:20:33+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday is a poor example, because Keys are used opportunistically.

Therefor  all games with weapons lists (particularly ones that list damage) are hardcoded for ethical choices...even if its just as simple as "To bash you with this club or not to bash you with this club".<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the system has any kind of resolution mechanic that could be used to bully / intimidate / steal / manipulate / trick / abuse / spread rumors about / etc / etc / etc.  Then it is hardcoded for ethical choices.  The particular flavor of ethical choices can be spun by the kind of skills, traits, qualities, the character definition has or even the kind of examples of play the rules use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, any system which envisions situations where the interests of living creatures are or could become at odds with each other provides the opportunity for players to have their characters make ethical choices.  Depending on how niggly you want to get with the phrase "hard coded" I would say any reference to using the game engine (whatever it is) to resolve those differences can be said to be hard coded" for ethical decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could a game exist that DOESN'T do these things...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227146/#Comment_227146" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T08:45:14+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:45AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 9:23AM by Josh Roby.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two cases:<br><br>In Palladium games, you have an alignment, one of nine-or-so lists of stuff you do and do not do.  IIRC, when you consistently break your alignment, the GM is directed to give you less roleplaying XP.  The converse, more XP when you play to your alignment, is sort of implied but not really stated.  There are also no explicit rules for changing alignment, but it's Palladium \u2014 there are no explicit rules for a lot of stuff, and players are sort of expected to make up procedures of their own.  So in rough form, alignment is really just a set of guidelines for how your dude can pick up some roleplaying XP (amusingly similar to TSOY).<br><br>In GURPS, there are a number of disadvantages you can take, such as Code of Honor or Vow.  Taking these disadvantages gives you more character points to play with but constrain your choices in play.  Importantly, if you have, say, "Honest," you <em>are not allowed to lie</em>.  Disadvantages are iron-clad in this respect \u2014 instead of opening up moral and ethical choices for play, disadvantages actually remove choice from the picture.  Now, I suspect actual play sees this rule ignored often, but as far as rules-as-written goes, "ethical" disadvantages function to remove, not define, choice.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227150/#Comment_227150" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T08:58:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><br>But isn't that in and of itself an ethical choice, taking "ethics" in the broadest sense of "having to do with values"?</br></blockquote>\nYou're right, Bill.

I would argue in a game like AD&amp;D, killing the monster is not an ethical choice,  not in the context of the game. Playing within your alignment would be the "ethics" of the game, because that is where the player is defining his character's beliefs and the societal norms. But for most AD&amp;D characters, violating alignment does nothing mechanically. It is up to the DM to enforce the ethics of that alignment, or make the character change alignments.<br/><br/>Does Dogs in the Vineyard have any mechanics that actually enforce or influence how characters act toward one another? I mean, if ever there were a game about ethical questions, that would be it, but the whole point is for the players to come up with their character's ethics.

If the only reason I don't kill you is because mechanically my "good" god will be mad and me at take away my +2 AC bonus...then my choice not to kill you is a non choice.  So as soon as you have mechanics around it at that level you've removed the player from the equation.  And putting the player in the equation *IS* what makes it interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo no, in Dogs there is nothing that enforces or influences...nor should their be.  That would destroy the entire point of the game.  When you the player decide that the best solution for this town is to gun down the women and girls who are practicing witch craft...you the player are on the hook for that decision.  You the player then get to look at yourself afterwards and realize "whoa...I just managed to justify murder in the name of my beliefs...&lt;blink&gt;"   and THAT is what Dogs is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put the Bash or not to Bash in the same category.  Ultimately at the end of the day you as the player made a choice that playing a game about murdering sentient beings for their gold was a "fun" way to spend the afternoon.  That strategizing the best way to intrude in someone else's home to kill and rob makes for good entertainment.  Most people aren't self reflective enough to sit back and have a "whoa...&lt;blink&gt;" moment about it.  But to me...THAT'S what makes it an interesting ethical statement...that they DON'T reflect on it at all IS the answer to the ethical question.  The personal ethics we have that let us kill orcs and take their stuff in a game are the same ethics that are being called into question in the movie District 9*...which is essentially a modern day D&amp;D; game with aliens instead of orcs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* &lt;minor spoilers&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPicture Wickum as the Paladin appointed by the Church of MNU leading a "party" into an "orc" warren...with the dudes in the helicopter playing the part of Wizards with Fireballs...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227182/#Comment_227182" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T10:20:52+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 10:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if it is the use of "ethics" or "ethical" that makes this a more cloudy discussion?

Have something in-game that makes it attractive (extra dice, bonuses, new abilities, etc.) Or how in Cold City you can actually give your character a bonus if you betray someone else, so it adds to the possibility of betrayal, and it is an actual sacrifice if you choose not to betray another PC.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227184/#Comment_227184" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T10:26:43+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 10:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why do you need / want that to be mechanical?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs not the reason you would make those choices in the game the same reasons as you would make those choices in real life?

If you have players who generate their own conflict, that's great, but some play very conservatively, and there is little to spur them into action.<br><br>A prime example: If you rob a bank in a role-playing game, you don't actually get any money. In truth, you get nothing except some narration. If there is a mechanical benefit in the game to doing so, however, that can prove as attractive as a bag full of cash to a real-life bank robber.<br><br>And like you pointed out: In Star Wars there is no real benefit to going over to the Dark Side, but in the fiction it is a constant threat. So why would any player "grapple" with it in-game if there really is absolutely no benefit to going all Dark? There has to be something that makes it attractive, not just relying on the player to say "You know, I think I will have my guy become a Sith because it fits the story."

Like an incentive that keeps things equal. When it becomes an overwhelming bonus, for one-time, it can still remain a choice. When it's <i>always</i> better to do something, then it's not really a choice. Because the mechanics make the choice for you.

The Mountain Witch uses the Trust mechanic to create a specific narrative. It helps that during the mountain-climb you know there will be other, worse conflicts above, and when you get to the Wtich, you know that you don't have what to save for. As such, and seeing how it's built, The Mountain Witch is a bona fide Story Game. It uses the mechanics to help goad the players into creating a specific sort of story, with a specific progression and pacing.<br><br>The characters' ethical choices are often not real choices, but the narrative is that of ethical choices made by the characters. And as a narrative, it can be plenty powerful, and it helps that the players know going in what kind of story they're telling.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227232/#Comment_227232" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T12:30:13+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:30PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if what Michael really wants is what I understand to be described by "Right-facing arrows".

Making "good" (morally commendable) choices frequently means making sacrifice, and players do not often experience what that sacrifice entails; when a PC goes without lunch, the player isn't hungry.  Consider the number of D&amp;D characters that have slept on the side of the road without even a bedroll because there was no penalty for it.  Sleeping at an inn would cost them a silver, after all, and a tent could cost as much as half a gold.  The player doesn't experience the cold, hard ground, so there is literally no consequence other than saving a trifling amount of cash.  <br><br>Adding mechanics gives a concrete reason to the player for the choice.  I will not make any comment as to the quality of any particular system.  As Ralph commented, there can easily be narrative reasons for a moral decision.  Designers, being what they are, will naturally be inclined to provide tools including tools for making moral choices mechanically meaningful.<br><br>I have back-burnered my Existentialist game for now, but I would be interested in games that have actual hard-coded moral theories in them.  "What if this were the way the world worked?" in the same fashion.  Most games, at least those that mechanize moral choices, seem to be coming from an Objectivist/Rational Egoism approach.  TSOY's keys could be hacked into a Relativist (of a variety of flavors) framework without too much challenge.  What would Emotivist or Intuitionist moral mechanics look like?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227242/#Comment_227242" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T12:47:14+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:47PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael there are good ways to have mechanics that highlight certain types of choices.  Typically when I've seen these executed well there is a certain double edge to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn MW when you trust somebody that person is able to help you.  But they're also able to harm you.  So the mechanic isn't really incentivizing a particular decision so much as highlighting an available decision.  Its not the sort of mechanic that would be good for all games, but it is effective for focusing your attention in MW on the issue of trust and betrayal...or more broadly honor, which is the specific purpose of the Witch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Vincent's Apocalypse World there is a similar mechanic around History (Hx) which is specifically not how much you trust someone but how well you know them.  Being an open extroverted person typically means you know other people well and they know you.  Being a more solitarty person can make it harder for others to screw you but it also makes it harder for you to help them.  Being a Brainer (a psychic) makes it easier for you to know others and harder for them to know you.  Which reduces (initially) your exposure to being screwed, but increases (initially) your ability to screw others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis itself is not mechanizing ethics but it does lead to interesting ethical questions.  For example.  Given that we are exposed to a greater potential of screwage from a Brainer, does that justify taking a discriminatory stance against them.  In our game for instance, the group's Brainer is banned from the upper levels of our settlement (where the "important" people live) because she's dangerous (and crazy).  Fair?  not Fair?  There's no mechanical benefit directly to this ban, but it is an interesting ethical question that falls out of the history mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227273/#Comment_227273" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T13:25:26+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  1:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>I wonder if what Michael really wants is what I understand to be described by "Right-facing arrows".

Or do you want Humanity and Alignment rules?</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nYeah, I think you are in the general area of what I am interested in. <br><br>Take for instance Best Friends. Unless you have a group that is actively in the game, working the fiction and narrative, there is no reason to start conflicts. You don't "get" anything in the game by having conflicts. There is no real incentive to have the Smart girl try and steal the boyfriend of the Pretty except that it is part of the story, and without making the attempt, you really don't have a game. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Whereas in Cold City (sorry I keep going back to that as my example) you can actually get your character out of a life-threatening situation by screwing over another player, because if you choose to betray that Trust, it gives you a benefit in rolling the dice. <br/><br/>So there is an actual enticement, beyond storytelling, to the action, which in turn drives the story.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227389/#Comment_227389" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T19:29:55+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:29PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm doing something similar to encoding character ethic into the mechanics with my current line of projects.<br/><br/>I'm doing something similar to encoding character ethic into the mechanics with my current line of projects.<br/><br/><a href="http://vulpine.110mb.com/RSR_A4_sml_bw.pdf" rel="nofollow">Rajah Spiny Rat</a> is where I really started putting together the cogs that form the mechanism, but it's gradually being refined through a series of playtests.<br/><br/>The idea actually goes back to a notion I had about <a href="http://vulpinoid.blogspot.com/2009/01/game-mechanism-of-week-3-tarot.html" rel="nofollow">Tarot Cards</a>.<br/><br/>Characters at their essence are a block of stats, but if characters use only their stats they are at a certain disadvantage in the system. Character are capable of following paths that are allow them to manipulate certain game mechanisms to their advantage, but every path also imposes some kind of restriction on the character.<br/><br/>The more strongly they adhere to their path, the more moral; dilemmas they will face, but the more powerful they will eventually become.<br/><br/>Do I adhere to my path now for the chance at some extra strength later on?<br/><br/>Do I forsake my path for a bit of instant gain?<br/><br/>Players deliberately choose a range of paths to reflect the values of the characters and the aspects the characters most strongly identify with.<br/><br/>To make this more meaningful, players often invoke one another's moral dilemmas. They activate their own strengths, but they activate the weaknesses of others.<br/><br/>It's still a work in progress, but it's been interesting to see where different groups have taken the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227422/#Comment_227422" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T22:44:32+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 10:44PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet Jesu, Ralph is like the Living Embodiment of RIGHT in this thread. I can't say anything better than he has.<br/><br/>Two bits of (hopeful) clarity I'd like to add: "hard coded" is a red herring. Ralph's pointed this out, but hard coded does not equal system. The game's setting, premise or even optional rules text can present the characters in an position to make ethical choices. Those are all very valid elements to a roleplaying game. <br/><br/>And, as Ralph acutely pointed out, system can provide opportunities for ethical decisions in many ways. Sure, you can have "STATE ETHICS/MAKE ETHICAL DECISION NOW" mechanics like my retarded games or you can provide a player with the tools to commit violence, rape, harassment, theft in the game and leave it up to the player's own (ethical) choice as to if and how he'll engage with those rules. On one hand, if the game doesn't enforce an ethical position, players can easily devolve their characters into a band of sociopaths. On the other hand, allowing the player the space to make a real meaningful decision to take his finger off the (proverbial) trigger can be very powerful. Both are ethical decisions, I think, but both have different impact on play.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Luke                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227756/#Comment_227756" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T21:47:12+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  9:47PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are trying to create ethics mechanics, the easiest way would be to not reward unethical behavior, but then the choices must be defined by the creator, or gm. Unfortunately, you run the risk of the choice ceasing to be a choice. If I played a game where my character lost some kind of resource for killing npcs, I would stop so that I don't run out of resources. After a while, I wouldn't even consider that action. My choice is limited, but my character's behavior is curbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDogs wants the idea of right or wrong to be considered, but it doesn't specifically reward, or punish either. You can take fallout doing something as simple as a can shooting contest depending on the dice (as the rules are written).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm unsure of any games with specific morality mechanics, and I would shy away from those because I play to escape certain realities; moral choices being one of them. I have plenty of time in real life to consider morality, especially since in real life morality matters where in imaginationland, it doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
