There exist several Nomics out there whose purpose is to create a board game; the one that's probably the best known is Nomopoly (using a Nomic to create a Monopoly-like game).  I've often wondered about using a Nomic similarly to create a roleplaying game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99894/#Comment_99894" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T23:37:32+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 11:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's called <i>Universalis</i>.  ;-)<br/><br/>That's somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but the ability to hack the rules is actually built into the rules.

Because the whole object of the game will be to change the rules (and in the end: win). So, maybe, design around a trad game setup with scenes for player characters, except that instead of a scene you can propose a rule change, no matter how small or how big - if it's voted through, then it's in the game.<br/><br/>It could be interesting...and exhausting <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99987/#Comment_99987" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T21:03:05+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  9:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, yeah, my roommate and I in college tried to do this as an exercise, twice.

All you have to do is not include a winning condition in the initial ruleset.  I think the Nomopoly rulesets had an explicit "we're working toward making a Monopoly-like board game" condition built in, which is what I'm looking at for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
