So, setting a game in the shadow of Perdido Street Station, not so interesting, but taking that novel's kind of thinking so that we play a game where we consider the effect of a series of man-eating undersea kingdoms on the coastal villages or how a planar invasion of Githyanki effects a confederacy of city-state's anti-slavery laws...yes.<br/><br/>The whole game doesn't have to be about these things but I like those kinds of socio-economic touches brewing under the surface of the settings where I play.<br/><br/>Richard K. Morgan's books have this kind of vibe too.  The Steel Remains, his latest, a fantasy novel in the swords &amp; sorcery tradition just drips with it.<br/><br/>So, those are my Mieville-ish thoughts.<br/><br/>And you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210610/#Comment_210610" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T14:12:52+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  2:12PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My one-word answer...

Adamant Entertainment will publish a roleplaying game that will allow fans of the series to have their own adventures in the city of New Crobuzon. Subsequent game books will continue to explore the setting and characters of the world of Bas-lag.<br/><br/>"The city of New Crobuzon is an incredibly rich setting," said Adamant Entertainment owner Gareth-Michael Skarka. "We're extremely proud to be producing a game that gives it the level of detail and attention that it deserves."<br/><br/>"I grew up on RPGs," said China Mi\xe9ville, "And the idea of a Bas-Lag game is incredibly exciting and humbling. That people might want to play in the world of my books is a tremendous honour."<br/><br/>The game will also feature a special treat for Mi\xe9ville's fans -- the original map of the city of New Crobuzon, drawn by the author, as well as his own illustrations of some of the creatures found in the world of Bas-lag.</i><br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamingreport.com/article.php?sid=24840&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamingreport.com/article.php?sid=24840&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210614/#Comment_210614" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T14:27:18+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  2:27PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SWEET!

However, the implication of the various sorts of advice (perhaps as a result of self-selection in audience tastes) has been for a level of detail that ranges from minimal to moderate, never super-dense. I'm sure for many groups that's a very good thing. I mean, I'm the only one in my group that likes even to <i>read</i> Victor Hugo, let alone to play a game with that level of detail, tangent and exploration in their leisure time.<br/><br/>What if, With Great Power-style, you couldn't advance the plot before you introduced, created, or interacted with a certain number of very specific setting details?  (The former two could be requirements for the GM, if there was one, or all three could be available for all players.)<br/><br/>I don't really agree that IAWA's oracles are a great idea for this. You get four oracle pulls per chapter, and a highly limited cast is a feature, not a bug, in that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210826/#Comment_210826" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T21:46:20+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  9:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Storn,<br/><br/>The way to do a Bas Lag-ish BW game would be to make up the baseline humanish lifepaths.

Sure, the NPC races are easy, monster burner is fine.  But for the PCs... mmmm....My one problem with BW is that there is so much to know and understand JUST for humans... add in dozens upon dozens of aliens.... not gonna fly under that weight in my estimation.  <br/><br/>But if you could do a mix-match.  HEre are a bunch of "Born this" and have a GENERIC lifepath as well as human as well as what we have so far (wolf, spider, gifted, whatever you can pull from Burning Empires)... maybe you got something.  But there is a lot of stuff that needs to be widdled away and added.  Because Bas-Lag is firmly rooted (in my mind) to Victorian England (railroads, newspapers, industry etc etc), the current mediaeval human lifepath is quite right for the flavor.

The protagonists of Perdid Street Station and The Scar are outside the law, down on their luck, and generally victims of the power structure of the places where they live. They're not kick-ass heroes who hobnob with kings and generals. This theme is taken even further in Iron Council, where the protagonists are workers, slaves and prostitutes.<br/><br/>To me, for a game to really take place in Mieville's world, it would have to have mechanics for driving that kinds of play and creating those kinds of character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210950/#Comment_210950" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T13:04:29+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  1:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>The language is certainly excellent, although I'd say it's icing for the ideas underneath.

If George RR Martin wrote a book set in Westeros but from the view of commoners, it's not really the same setting as presented in his current books. Or perhaps I'm getting my setting and situation mixed up.<br/><br/>Maybe it's this: You can have protagonists in a Bas Lag RPG that come from a radically different place than the protagonists of the books, but then you're not playing a game that's based on the Bas Lag books. Inspired by them, certainly, but it's not a game that's letting you tell stories in the same vein/feel/theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211023/#Comment_211023" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T23:18:41+00:00" title="June  8, 2009 11:18PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, probably I just disagree with people's opinions on what the books are about, though perhaps in a very finicky way.

Either is totally valid, although, as you both point out, these different approaches will have a huge effect on what you'd take from the books and put in a game.<br/><br/>For me, if I was going to play a game set in New Crobuzon, it would have to be about issues of class struggle and power inequity, because otherwise I wouldn't be getting what I wanted. <br/><br/>For someone else, the real draw might be the city itself, or other elements of the setting fiction. (Of course, I love that stuff too, and I'd want my character to know golem magic, and have to run from a Weaver at some point).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Well, probably I just disagree with people's opinions on what the books are about, though perhaps in a very finicky way.

I think the protagonists of Mieville's books are specifically members of classes who lack social power. Certain people in his world read Runagate Rampant, and certain people don't, and the "heroes" of the stories are always the former.<br/><br/>You reference playing a judge or army general in a game... but I suspect Mieville would never write a book from the point of view of such a character. His sympathies clearly lie in opposition to western (British?) social power structures as we know them, and I think that is reflected in the books - Iron Council is the most explicit example of this.<br/><br/>Of course, all the monsters are a big part of the awesome, either way you look at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211086/#Comment_211086" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T11:59:14+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 11:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite><br/><br/>Of course, all the monsters are a big part of the awesome, either way you look at it.</blockquote>\n"<i>And when I write my novels, I\u2019m not writing them to make political points.

I think this may be due to Mieville's leftist tendencies, as well as his love/hate relationship with Tolkein.  It's a pretty horrible political system IIRC, without universal franchise, with multiple political parties that are either totally corrupt or totally ineffectual, and a Mayor who functions more as President-for-Life of the city-state.  The middle class is cosseted, and the poor are manipulated and savagely repressed when they get uppity.  I always wondered if it's, in part, a reflection of life in Maggie Thatcher's Britain.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh yeah, upon checking WIkipedia (which has a nice summary of this), there's at least two fascist parties and a draconian legal system.  The Remade are a living symbol of the terror and injustice of the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211098/#Comment_211098" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T12:21:48+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 12:21PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian,<br/><br/>I'm sorry if my questions were too much, but I was trying to get a better sense of what you mean by focusing on the punk aspect of the setting. Right now I'm utterly confused. Other than, protagonists should be lower class, I don't know what sort of play you would want from such a RPG. <br/><br/>Admittedly, the thoughts I had did not deal with playing in the setting or using it as inspiration per se, but rather playing a RPG based on the books - capturing the tone, the structure, and the pacing as well as the core of the characters and setting. Typically my design goal when looking at an existing source is to create a game which could, without force, recreate the original source material. It's a difficult goal, I'm just wondering how much it might overlap your interests here.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211103/#Comment_211103" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T12:28:32+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 12:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I find it highly suspect that Mieville claims his books have no political point when he's written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Equal-Rights-International-Materialism/dp/1931859337/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244575587&amp;sr=8-14" rel="nofollow">something like this</a>.

I'll nerd out a little here...<br/><br/>We want to play a New Crobuzon game, inspired by our mutual love of Mieville's incredible world and the books he has written. <br/><br/>The setting itself is the easy part. Regardless of the system we decide on, our game has to have cactacae, an appearance by a Weaver, Remade (possibly as PCs), golem magic, an encounter with Runagate Rampant, a trip to the Cacotopic Stain, vodyanoi, a fight with the militia, and, at some point, "Long live the Iron Council" will be written on a wall.<br/><br/>We can all agree on that much. <br/><br/>And any game can do that; we just have to throw it all in.<br/><br/>However, if we play D&amp;D, with mighty heroes wielding enchanted swords and defeating various foes, we're not playing what I would consider a New Crobuzon game, even if all those setting elements are present.<br/><br/>Someone else might disagree and say "No way, you're TOTALLY playing a New Crobuzon game!". Which is fine. But, to me, those characters aren't the protagonists in Mieville's works (although those types of characters do appear; explicitly, in fact).<br/><br/>If you said you were GMing a New Crobuzon game, and I showed up, all excited, and found out we were going to play high-ranking militia experts putting down a rebellion, I would fall to the ground, frozen with horror. In a different setting, I would totally play those guys. And I could see someone digging that take on New Crobuzon. But to me, it would be totally contrary to the spirit of the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211168/#Comment_211168" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T15:20:09+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  3:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Also, I find it highly suspect that Mieville claims his books have no political point when he's written<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Equal-Rights-International-Materialism/dp/1931859337/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244575587&amp;sr=8-14" rel="nofollow">something like this</a>.

That is, the setting of Perdido Street Station is New Crobuzon, a diverse tossed-salad of races, cultures, classes, and ideologies.  The themes of Perdido Street Station are things such as class struggle and power dynamics, as well as ambiguous moral grounds and the consequences of magic and technology.<br/><br/>Now, New Crobuzon just so happens to be well suited to exploring the themes listed above, but that does not mean there aren't a whole range of other stories that can be explored within the bounds of the city.  It's a city in which you can find anything and everything, so the range of possibilities is incredible.  I can very easily envision a successful monster-hunting campaign being run in New Crobuzon.  I can also see a family drama, a noir-style detective story, a war story, a comedy of errors, a mad-science misadventure, a romantic comedy, etc, etc. not one of which would have to touch on the themes of Perdido Street Station in order to make for entertaining gameplay.  Hell, there are even characters in Perdido Street Station that are called out as being D&amp;D-style adventurers.  Those characters exist, but their stories haven't been written yet.  Why not attempt telling them, if that's what suits your gaming group?<br/><br/>If you limit yourselves to exploring only the themes already explored within the books, you're cutting out a whole swath of possible tales.  If you want to replicate the feel of Perdido Street Station, sure, play a game that emphasizes those themes.  But if you want to play a game set in New Crobuzon, you're going to need something that gives you a little more freedom in terms of themes you might want to explore.<br/><br/>I'm all for an official New Crobuzon RPG.  I'm hoping it's not just a D&amp;D derivative, sure, but I wouldn't mind something that could handle that style if that's what I wanted to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211241/#Comment_211241" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T00:32:30+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 12:32AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>If you said you were GMing a New Crobuzon game, and I showed up, all excited, and found out we were going to play high-ranking militia experts putting down a rebellion, I would fall to the ground, frozen with horror.

I can absolutely imagine Mieville writing a story from the perspective of these people and I think it would be very easy to do so in a way that complements and reinforces the perspectives of his other books. I don't understand how 'the protagonists are military officers' also means 'and therefore the military are the good guys and there is nothing wrong with the power structures of the society' -- it just seems really straightforward to me that you can have the same thematic concerns while looking at the situation from the other side. Because they're still characters in the same situation -- and the situation is, generally speaking, the setting and its relations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211247/#Comment_211247" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T02:10:37+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  2:10AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe that the relevent issue is not "Could there be high powered adventures (or whatever) in New Crobuzon?" Because clearly, there could be. However, these things are not dealt with in any of Mieville's fiction, and if you're wanting to play in a Bas Lag setting it's important to ask <i>why</i> you want to play in a Bas Lag setting. Is it because you want to recreate the feel of the fiction in gaming, or because cactacae (insert setting detail here) are cool?<br/><br/>If it's the former, then you absolutely want some restrictions or guides that help to recreate the fiction - and "people in power are generally not PCs" is one of them. If it's the latter, then porting the setting details you enjoy into a game you already like and play successfully may end up being a more fruitful venture.<br/><br/>Some people think that Vampire: the Masquerade lost a lot of its thematic power once you had rules for playing Elders or characters who had happily abandoned Humanity.

But I propose that what you are trying to get at is not so much a matter of one-line character identities, but what the characters do, short and long term over the course of the game. <br/><br/>For example, I suspect you would be equally incapacitated by a game where the protagonists where factory workers, remade, and ne'er-do-wells who band together to keep out subtle invading threats from beyond the city and to help the beleaguered mayoral government. <br/><br/>But they are not 1) higher class or 2) putting down rebellions. This is the problem with defining things with negatives. This is why I kept asking what you want your Bas-Lag protagonists to do. Then it becomes possible to used the design of the game to encourage that type of play. <br/><br/>For example, the hack I was considering can easily be structured so that every character is predominantly described by 2-3 dreams and the associated authorities which serve to block the achievement of those dreams. Over the course of play, as there are continual confrontations with these authorities (social, financial, physical, mystical), the dreams come closer to achievement and the authorities become more potent in their hostilities. Ultimately the dream will either be abandoned or achieved, but if achieved then the world changes - but hardly in a predictable way. There is, after all, always a cost for getting something which our heart desires. <br/><br/>(Aside: The game in question already handles the literary feel well, with chapter and book break down of play, easy support of parallel action and the introduction and removal of characters mid-stream. And it meets one of my hardest requirements for a Bas-Lag, being able to play the Weaver in a balanced, fun way.)<br/><br/>My question is would such a handling suffice. After all, regardless of your social class, if you are defined in terms of your conflict with authority - be it academic, political, etc., then you will be struggling against that authority as the main action of play. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211279/#Comment_211279" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T07:59:26+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  7:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>or because . . .

The actual play of actual characters is not, for me, the important part of what's going on. It seems like I'm hearing many people say that what's important to them about Bas Lag isn't the actual stories of actual characters either - rather exploring the world, its structure, its hierarchies, how problems are addressed in that world, its fascinating minutae and details, and how it reflects/deconstructs our own world. Shock: is already a good candidate (as a game about the intersection of weird setting elements and social ramification), made stronger by the fact that it's perfectly fun to just make up a world and talk about it, never getting around to "actual play".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211367/#Comment_211367" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T11:14:16+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 11:14AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Along these lines .. I have a set of homebrew rules for a steampunk-ish game that began life as a Spirit of the Century hack. One of my favorite things about that game is the chargen system. In my hack, the second iteration of character creation was called "Marked by the Machine" -- it was deliberately intended to create the sorts of characters from the New Crobuzon books:<br/><br/><i><b>Marked by the Machine </b><br/>How did the character run afoul of the authorities (either the Royal Charter Companies, the church, the police or the crown itself)? Is he outlawed and hunted, or is his transgression unknown, enabling him to work against the power structure undetected? Why does he struggle against authority, and is his struggle willing or unwilling? Write a single sentence describing recent, disastrous events in the character's life. </i><br/><br/>So, in *my* New Crobuzon game, you wouldn't have a choice as to whether or not this was your character's lot in life. You ARE outside the power structure, you just get to tell us why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211368/#Comment_211368" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T11:15:07+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 11:15AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2009 11:26AM by Judd.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, to make your own N.C.:<br/><br/>1) Take your three favorite human-ish monsters out of the Monster Manual and they are minority citizens in the city.  Detail how they get along, how being in the city has culturally changed them and what niches they fill in the city.  How do the powers that rule the city keep them down?<br/><br/>2) Take three really bizarre fucking monsters and figure out how they exist in the nooks and crannies of the city and how the powers that rule the city keep these beasts from doing unacceptable amounts of damage?<br/><br/>3) Um...play?<br/><br/>So, I'll do one.<br/><br/>1) 3 monsters: Githyanki, Minotaur and ...something not quite so martial...maybe...sprites.<br/><br/><b>Githyanki</b>:  These Githyanki are refugees, AWOL soldiers from countless planar wars and whole military companies who were cut off from communication with the Liche Queen's grace.  Some still worship her and pray for her to make contact (or even take this plane ever in a barrage of silver swords and red dragon fire) and others in an attempt to rebel against their upbringing and actually have adopted their own approximation of Githzarai meditation techniques.<br/><br/>The Githyanki are forbidden from carrying any weapons larger than a knife, due to a paranoia that their Liche-Queen will one day contact them and they will rise up and attempt to take the city by force.  Due to this, many carry silver knives on their hips, in memory of the silver swords of their past.<br/><br/><b>Minotaur:</b>  The minotaur have built many of the winding alleys of the city, leading it to be almost unmappable and very difficult to navigate.  This pleases the minotaur aesthetic, as they not only lived in labyrinths in their home country but their religion worships the winding roads that life leads you on.  The city's powers are slowly starting to elevate minotaurs into civic posts, especially as more and more Githyanki refugees are moving into Minotaur neighborhoods.  The minotaur are being cast in the role as the city's valiant defenders against the vile foreigners.<br/><br/><b>Sprites</b>:  As the city has overcome their groves, the sprites have adapted.  They treat building roofs and water containers as their groves now and refuse to live indoors.  Their inability to live indoors causes the city's elders to treat them as illegal immigrants from the land of Faery.  Many rich folk even use hawks to hunt sprites as they are seen as sub-human and not fully sentient.<br/><br/>2) <b>Illithid</b>: The city's elders have a deal with a cabal of Illithid in the sewers, discreetly sending down those in poverty, orphans or homeless who they assume none would miss to feed their brain-hunger.  In return, the cabal keep to the sewer deeps and send word of rebellious thoughts from above.<br/><br/><b>Otyugh</b>: These beasts are use to consume garbage, tamed by those who collect trash and utilized by the underworld to devour bodies.<br/><br/><b>Dragon:</b>  There is a dragon sleeping in the Boiling Bay, and has slept there since the city's founding.  Every season, treasures are put into the bay and allowed to sink to the bottom so that the dragon's hoard will be great, giving it sweet dreams and deep sleep.<br/><br/>If someone could make their own N.C. using the above method, that'd be keen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211369/#Comment_211369" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T11:16:00+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 11:16AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br/><br/>Joshua's current project, Xenon, sounds a whole lot like what you are talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

They are cranky and mean-spirited, but can build anything, and are susceptible to flattery. They are considered "vermin" by the militia, but are rarely bothered. <br/><br/><b>Tiefling</b>: A lone tiefling lives above her shop (which is never open) in the magic quarter. She is feared by her neighbors, most of whom know her true identity, but keep it secret out of fear and self-interest; she often knows things that cannot be discerned by more pedestrian means. A sharp-eyed militia investigator suspects her existence, and spends his time looking for signs of her passage though the city.<br/><br/><b>Bariaur: </b> A clan of bariaur were hired by the city as elite mercenaries, and brought to New Crobuzon through a planar portal. Betrayed by both their employers and their weak-willed clan elder, they escaped into the city.

I just went from memory too*, but this exercise did get me thinking about some of the truly awesome monsters that are sitting there, unloved and unused, in the vast D&amp;D rules universe. <br/><br/>In my closet, I've got monster books from every edition of D&amp;D, plus piles of other stuff (Dungeon, Dragon, Gazetters, ect). After this thread, I'm excited to sit down and go through them all and just take stuff out -- descriptions, weird powers, and (most importantly) pictures -- and use that in a monster-heavy fantasy game. Or even one or two cool monsters for my upcoming Storming the Wizards's Tower game.<br/><br/>Which has nothing to do with China Mieville, per se, but it seems to be in the spirit of his work.<br/><br/>Good thread!<br/><br/>* The bariuar were always one of my favorites. I found a way to stick them in every fantasy city I created in my D&amp;D days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212017/#Comment_212017" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T14:52:38+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  2:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2009 2:53PM by Brian_Minter.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT.
