But I realized that, as a player, I like seeing horror elements racked up that my PC can overcome and either <br/><br/>Shoot in the Head, or<br/>Run Away From. Dramatically.<br/><br/>As a GM, though, I'm really not sure of things I can do to really enhance horror in an otherwise average horror game or session. Aside from turning the lights down low. I'm thinking of more dialogue tricks, descriptive tricks, pacing tricks, etc that I could use. <br/><br/>What are some things you have done (or things you have thought of doing) as a GM to make your horror game more "horror...ish" to your players?<br/><br/>For games, I'm thinking anything from CoC, Delta Green, Chill, Dread, Conspiracy of Shadows or even a horror-themed D&amp;D, Burning Empires, or other game session.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58276/#Comment_58276" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T09:58:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  9:58AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 9:59AM by Graham.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to describe things matter-of-factly, using a soft tone of voice, with much visual detail.

It was an Unknown Armies short campaign I ran back in 2005.  Rather than a monster-hunting game, but a "normal guy suddenly put in an extraordinary, completely insane situation" sort.<br/><br/>* I had my players do some "homework" -- I asked them to detail the beginning on their nightmare for that night (as every session was one day in a week).  They we would start off the sessions with their individual nightmares, and I would twist is a bit further.<br/><br/>This helped because: it started to establish a futility of resting.  They began dreading everything, but also realized they couldn't just do nothing.<br/><br/>* They each had photographs that showed two people getting killed a week from the start of the campaign.  They couldn't show the photos of their charges to the other players, as if you looked at one of these magic photos you would see the people you were suppose to save.  The catch:  two of the characters had photos of people they never met.  The third had pictures of other two characters failing and being killed.  He and I kept this secret from the other players for a few game days.  The second catch: these two incidents were taking place at the exact same time, but a few miles from one another.<br/><br/>This helped because: it tied the PCs together and because it reinforced the "I can't save everyone, but I can try to save <em>someone</em>." sense that I was going for.<br/><br/>* As they faced horrors inside their mind and dealt with the unnatural world they were suddenly experiencing, I killed off their best friend &amp; mentor with a heart attack.  At first, they started talking about other mages that might have been rivals, but they started to realize that sometimes a heart attack is just that -- a natural, horrible thing.  That got a good session out of them wondering what they were going to do and understanding that weren't invulnerable to problems that plague normal people.<br/><br/>This helped because: it created the most amazing futility -- they were convinced that there wasn't anything they could really do -- but they pressed on anyway whatever the cost.  It also created one of the more memorable scenes for me, where one of the PCs went out and had sex with an NPC she loathed, just to feel alive.  The players narrated crying in this man's arms, a man the PC would have gladly seen disappear.  Afterwards, I said to the player something like "Dude, that's some heavy stuff."  His response was "You run a f**ked-up game."<br/><br/>(I used this trick again, this time on a PC whose player didn't show up for the last session of the another UA campaign, but with a stray bullet not long after they had just finished fighting a monster.  The folks who weren't there for my last UA game said that the random, meaningless death did a good job of heightening the horror tones.)<br/><br/>I hope some of this helps.  I don't really have specific tips I can think of, though I wish I did.  I just kinda do horror games by intuition, and hit my stride when we dive deep into psychological horror -- the sort of thing you can't either shoot in the head or run away from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58284/#Comment_58284" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:16:19+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:16AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have my bad things<br/>1) Look like humans.<br/>2) Show off their power casually.<br/><br/>Also, cannibalism.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58292/#Comment_58292" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:24:03+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:24AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My players don't like any of the usual 'horror game tricks' that are listed, they're more interested in figuring out how their characters would react to being psychotically frightened out of their wits than being the least bit frightened or creeped out themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward" title="Scott Dorward"><img alt="Scott Dorward" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward">Scott Dorward</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58294/#Comment_58294" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:30:31+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:30AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The unknown seems to be a real trigger for most players.  I've found that narrating the environment of a scene without offering any explanation (usually in the kind of matter-of-fact tone that Graham mentions above) can really creep some players out.<br/><br/>As an example, I've been running a short campaign of Sorcerer recently.  One of the player characters was looking for her missing father in a house in West Hollywood, and had convinced the other two PCs to come along as backup; really bad things had been happening to all of them recently, making them a bit on edge.  They go into the house and find a locked room.  I described the ambient details -- the sweet, pungent smell of rotting meat; the sound of many flies buzzing in the room; the gentle scratching of _something_ at the door (accompanied by me scratching the wood of the table).<br/><br/>It took over ten minutes for the players to summon the courage to break down that door.  Every time they got close, I just scratched the table again, and they backed off.  This is especially remarkable, as these were Sorcerer characters with hideously powerful demons at their command, not fragile Call of Cthulhu investigators.  <br/><br/>Even once they broke the door down and could see shapes moving around the floor in the semi-darkness, they were all still to afraid to go straight in.  It was a wonderful moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58296/#Comment_58296" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:31:15+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:31AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 10:32AM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that I cannot emphasize enough is that you must know what is scary to your players. This can be either general or specific, but it makes a huge difference if you hit it right or turn the campaign into a joke because no one is biting. (JD also gets into this a bit -- many players aren't interested in being frightened, they are interested in their characters being horrified. Know which your players want, because they are not the same game.) <br/><br/>This is also a very hard thing to do, because we all have ideas of what is scary and tend to run with those because, well hell we know they're scary, right? But not everything works for every player. For example, I don't have existential angst about the size of the universe or the fact that we don't know most of it, so most Cthulhu-tentacle horror makes me yawn. "Oh noz! Tentacles from beyond space-time! Yawn." Similarly, I don't remember my own dreams most of the time, and haven't had nightmare in years (at least not one that I remember) so games that make heavy use of nightmares tend to bore me. (This can be overcome by making the nightmares prophetic or giving discreet and specific effects for them, but most of the time....) <br/><br/>You want to scare me? Have human beings doing horrific things for reasons of strong ideology. Stuff like Unknown Armies or Delta Green gets at me when it shows the ways that all our best intentions: our religion, our philosophy, our politics, can go horribly, terribly wrong. This article is like a "how to run horror for Brand" article, and is totally <a href="http://www.nemesis-system.com/21st-century-horror.html" rel="nofollow">worth checking out</a>. <br/><br/>So, Ben's things are like my things, but my things are humans. And yes, showing off their powers casually is a good thing. Cannibalism, self-mutilation, deviant sexuality, and physical artifacts thereof, all described with a detachment that slowly turns creepy, are all excellent tools for description and focus. Keep it tangible, make it a solid touchable object, something that you can give a sense of weight to, a sense that it really could be real, and you'll generally scare me more than the most grandiose blood-flinging hallucinations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58297/#Comment_58297" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:31:31+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:31AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also depends on the kind of horror your trying to convey.<br/><br/>This isn't exhaustive but I see a few examples:<br/>Personal Horror - "oh no, what have I done?" or "What have I become?"<br/>Creature Horror - "oh, know what IS that thing?"<br/>Setting Horror - "oh no, I have no where to go!"<br/><br/>Briefly, I handle each differently (and of course mix and match depending on the game).<br/><br/>Personal Horror<br/>Allow the players to make assumptions and fuck with those assumptions.  Play with words and hint at conversations allowing them to make their own decisions and consequently bury themselves in deeper.  I once ran a game where they were asked to kill a priest that was possessed by a demon.  The woman gave them a scroll that would reveal the creature for what it was.  They never even questioned the act, nor did they research the scroll.  The scroll actually cast a series of illusions on the casters.  They killed him and felt like shit later.  In a vampire game I led the main PC down the primrose path against a "Dane" apparently bent on ruining him.  he found the Dane and killed him only to find out that he killed his fiance's parents.<br/><br/>Creature Horror<br/>Conventional killing shouldn't be able to handle the critter(s).  The critter has the possibility of complete destabilization of the setting and clues should slowly lead to that realization.  Critters are defined more by these two factors than your standard stats.  Describe the critter in bits and detailed motions but think about it in the victims point of view.  Height, weight and dimensions should only be brought in when researching the critter before or in the aftermath.  Use heart pounding and spotty references as if the creature were on top of you.<br/><br/>Setting Horror<br/>Sound, smell and taste become way important but don't over-do it.  Creating subtle ways for the PCs to key on that something horrible is just about to happen is VERY effective in raising the suspense bar.  I played in a game where two of the PCs were running from run of the mill special agents and were hiding in some brush when they both smelled some sort of decaying stench.  This was particularly bothersome because both PCs just happened to make characters that had independantly lost theri sense of smell.  Creepy.<br/><br/>I can expound on a few of these techniques but does this direction help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58301/#Comment_58301" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:50:18+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:50AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to specific techniques, here are some I've used successfully in KULT.  They may or may not work for your style, but they allowed me to give my players goosebumps and racing hearts.<br/><br/>1) Anticipation.  Make them feel like something's up.  Give them little descriptions that are forebearing.  But drag it out a bit.<br/>2) Vulnerability.  Separate the characters from anything that's save.  Or corrupt it.  Find out what they value and use it against them.  That goes for players too, as Brand points out.<br/>3) Cheap scares.  It works, too.  I played an NPC who was a mumbling lunatic, and when they leaned closer to hear what I was mumbling about, I screamed at them.  While it may seem like that was just a cheap trick, the players were definitely more on edge for the rest of the night.<br/>4) Cliches.  Everyone knows that a house with broken windows and fluttering curtains is just screaming to be haunted.  So once again, it might be cheap to stuff the characters in there, but when used well, cliches invoke a sense of dread because we KNOW something's going to happen in there.<br/>5) Revelations.  These need to be well-timed and prepared.  You know: the call comes from inside the house.  The guy you thought was your guide through the tunnels was murdered last week, so who's the one standing behind you right now?  And the KULT classic, after examining the horrible scratching sounds from the front door, when you close it, you see that the scratch marks are on the inside.<br/><br/>I wrote <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23285.msg230569#msg230569" rel="nofollow">something along the lines of Brand's post</a> on someone's horror game idea on the Forge the other day, by the way, complete with personal anecdotes and other silliness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58302/#Comment_58302" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:51:23+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:51AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 10:52AM by jenskot.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/printthread.php?t=27565&amp;pp=200" rel="nofollow">Steal stuff from here.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI love horror!

What is it? Is it a threat? Something else?<br/>\n<br/>\nTerror:<br/>\n- Show the danger the horror represents.<br/>\n- Introduce unnatural elements. Define the natural and break it.<br/>\n- Build tension... layer question after question... stretch the player's perceptions.<br/>\n- Make the environment works against the players. You are in the bad place.<br/>\n- Or you are in a place of safety that is being infected, threatened, and invaded.<br/>\n- Confuse the players. Make it so that they can't trust their own perceptions.<br/>\n- Don't give the players time to think.<br/>\n- Before the tension peaks... release it. Then build back up. Again and again...<br/>\n- Focus on instinct and reaction.<br/>\n- Show an obvious escape. Present potential threat. Cut off escape. The hunt is on!<br/>\n- Have NPCs sell the terror. Have the NPCs scream, cry, run, beg...<br/>\n- Make the players ask: I KNOW something is wrong but what do I do?

This is something that I used to do a lot of, although not so much in recent days.  For a while, in fact, Halloween was the time for the "creepy RPG night", starring Call of Cthulhu or Little Fears.<br><br>Here's a trick that I used when GMing Call of Cthulhu.  It's a cheap trick, I admit, but it gets the players in the right zone.<br><br>Violate the players' personal space.<br><br>Here's an example.  When we played CoC, we were actually in the basement of the local gaming store.  So, we were sitting at a table, with the fluorescent light guttering above us.  (I figured out that, by turning the bulb <i>just right</i>, you can make it flicker dimly.)  Well, I say that "we" were sitting.  In reality, my players were sitting, and I was pacing behind them.  I'd walk around the table while narrating, then stand really really close to someone.  The combination of someone large (me) standing too close plus looming over you is fairly unnerving.<br><br>Of course, I combined this with other tricks.  The dim light, for sure, although I also bought glow-in-the-dark dice so that we could roll them in the dark and still see what was going on.  Another variation of this is to use a black light and then highlight important information on the character sheet.  The highlighter will glow under the black light, letting you see, but it will also make for a totally messed-up play environment.<br><br>There are the voice tricks, of course.  One of my favorites was whispering, actually.  This combines well with a sudden yell for the "jump factor", but I also enjoyed whispering (and thereby raising expectations) when nothing actually happened.  Like this:  "You peer out of the window, straining to hear if the creature was returning.  But, try as you might, you can hear nothing."  Dropping your voice while you say this forces the players to strain to hear you.  Frustrated expectations then produce tension that isn't resolved, which then builds up over time.  So then, when you finally get in a good scare, all the built-up tension is released at that moment.<br><br>Just think of <i>Sixth Sense</i>.  One of the scenes that sticks in my mind is when the kid is standing outside his school, and all the leaves are blowing by.  What actually happened?  <i>Nothing.</i>  But you are expecting something to happen, so you're edgier by the time that something actually does happen.<br><br>Seth Ben-Ezra<br>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58317/#Comment_58317" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T11:34:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 11:34AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>The thing that I cannot emphasize enough is that you must know what is scary to your players.</blockquote>\nThis is exactly why I had my players write up their characters' nightmares in their own words.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>ust think of<i>Sixth Sense</i>.

Being suddenly aware of uncertainty is scary, and having the GM stop a simple narrative with a hidden die roll and some sort of facial reaction (evil grins, wincing, widened eyes and chortling are my favorites), and then continue the scene without anything immediately changing.  The players are aware that something's going on they don't know about, and that gives some edge.<br><br>But for it to work, you also have to deliver at times.  Roll the dice, cringe, and tell one of the players to make a roll to give out of the way of the leaping wolfman.  For the converse, to make those rolls worth something, the PCs have to win on occasion, so give 'em the early "You hear rustling in the brush.  You might not be alone out here." wins.<br><br>As I shifted away from games that supported secret dice rolls, I went from monster madness to psychological horror.  But no matter what the case, uncertainty and misinformation is king.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58410/#Comment_58410" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T16:59:43+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  4:59PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.  I don't have a whole lot of experience with horror, but my current first-time horror campaign is going pretty well.  <br><br>My technique seems very similar to the previously-mentioned essay by Bill Waters, <a href="http://www.nemesis-system.com/21st-century-horror.html" rel="nofollow"><b>21st Century Horror</b></a> -- despite the fact that it is set in Victorian London.  <br><br>My methodology has been to take all the pillars of society -- the things which the PCs believe in -- and make them horrible and twisted.  This has included the institutions of science, government, religion, and any romantic notions of magic.  This includes messing with the PCs themselves.  I'm thinking particularly of one PC who had letters written to him from a side of his personality.  I wanted to mess with his logical positivism, his faith that reason and rationality would inevitably show the right solution.  <br><br>Another is that all of the horrible things that happen are personally traceable back to the PCs.  Basically, they have no good choices, and whatever they do, there are terrible consequences.  So, for example, when they saved one woman from a marauding menace, they awakened a far more horrible creature.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58414/#Comment_58414" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T17:30:29+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  5:30PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 5:31PM by Call Me Curly.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In telling ghost stories around the campfire, it's effective if the storyteller allows herself to believe her own words enough to actually feel a tinge of visceral fear...<br><br>...and let it show to the listeners.<br><br><br/>"Waitaminute.

Horror games aren't necessarily about scaring the <i>player</i>, as JDCorley points out above.  Would you refuse to run a heist game with players who in real life aren't greedy, or a hack-and-slash game for players who'd faint at the sight of blood?  Of course not: what counts in those games is that they want to play <i>characters</i> who will lie, cheat, and steal to get rich, or who habitually kill things and take their stuff.  Few roleplaying games require the player to behave as his or her character does: why should a horror game be any different?  (And more importantly, why would you want to define your horror game's success by whether it scares your players, when you probably don't place similar conditions on your other games?)<br><br>And fortunately, lots of the techniques mentioned so far in this thread will work on the level of appropriate dramatic devices even if they don't give the players the heebie-jeebies.  In other words, they'll help the story part of the game (where the characters are presented with frightening things and freak the hell out over them) and create a satisfying experience for the players, even without actually scaring the players.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce" title="MtFierce"><img alt="MtFierce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/5582955/1136400"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce">MtFierce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58531/#Comment_58531" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T12:34:30+00:00" title="March  1, 2007 12:34PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2007 12:40PM by MtFierce.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a theory that horror games are just reflections of humour games.

I still think horror games are heavily strengthened by scaring the player.  But it depends on why your group is gaming:  do they want to (a) play a role or (b) have an experience?<br/><br/>If they want to play a role, then yeah, it's about horror to your characters.  Playing a Buffy-type game would be like this.<br/><br/>If they want to have an experience, then you're shifting to the horror for your players.  Tynes' story on "In Media Res," his Unknown Armies con scenario (which he talks about in <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/30/6" rel="nofollow">The Escapist</a>), is exactly this sort of thing, as would be games like Sorensen's <em>Lacuna</em>.  Sure, they're technically playing a role, but as a vehicle to gain an experience.<br/><br/>The UA games I run are in the "have an experience" category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58542/#Comment_58542" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T13:44:58+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  1:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MtFierce</cite>I have a theory that horror games are just reflections of humour games.

Description is actually something that can work against you: you want just enough to know the Abyss is there; the players know what they see in it, and will populate it with their own thinking, their own nightmares.   [shrug]</blockquote>\nI feel the same exact way!!! <br/><br/>Humor and Horror are all about tension and release, building expectations and breaking them. Both benefit from similar structures of delivery. <br/><br/>Set-up:<br/>- introduce something<br/>- the more honest, relatable, and personal the better<br/>- customize the details to your specific audience<br/>- be clear<br/>- talk when people are listening<br/><br/>Buildup/Reinforce:<br/>- solidify the reality of what's been introduced above<br/>- gain the audience's trust<br/>- establish expectations<br/>- build tension and curiosity till audience is fully invested<br/><br/>Punch-line/Reveal:<br/>- break expectations<br/>- break trust<br/>- surprise and twist at the very last moment possible while audience's interest is peaking<br/><br/>Release:<br/>- say nothing<br/>- pause expectantly<br/>- let the audience react<br/>- believe what you are selling<br/>- if you don't find it funny or horrifying, neither will your audience<br/><br/>The above doesn't have to be talking. It can be any form of communication. The joke or horror can be communicated with pictures, with gestures, dance, body language, song, or touch. And it doesn't have to be passive. The Punch-line/Reveal can be tied to choice or consequences of action.<br/><br/>You can use the above with most of the following:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Dread:<br/>- Never show the horror.<br/>- Hint. Suggest.<br/>- Show the aftermath.<br/>- Use omens that warn the horror is coming.<br/>- Foreshadow.<br/>- Let the players describe the horror in their own minds.<br/>- Focus on emotion, atmosphere.<br/>- Isolate the players.<br/>- Use adjectives in physical descriptions to communicate specific moods.<br/>- Focus on smell and sound.<br/>- Make the players ask: Is something wrong? What is it? Is it a threat? Something else?<br/><br/>Terror:<br/>- Show the danger the horror represents.<br/>- Introduce unnatural elements. Define the natural and break it.<br/>- Build tension... layer question after question... stretch the player's perceptions.<br/>- Make the environment works against the players. You are in the bad place.<br/>- Or you are in a place of safety that is being infected, threatened, and invaded.<br/>- Confuse the players. Make it so that they can't trust their own perceptions.<br/>- Don't give the players time to think.<br/>- Before the tension peaks... release it. Then build back up. Again and again...<br/>- Focus on instinct and reaction.<br/>- Show an obvious escape. Present potential threat. Cut off escape. The hunt is on!<br/>- Have NPCs sell the terror. Have the NPCs scream, cry, run, beg...<br/>- Make the players ask: I KNOW something is wrong but what do I do? Where do I go?<br/><br/>Gore:<br/>- Show everything.<br/>- Relish every disgusting detail.<br/>- Force the players to look away.<br/>- Focus on sight, touch, and taste.<br/>- Drown in the sheer physicality of the horror.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58558/#Comment_58558" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T15:02:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  3:02PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll go a little further and say that for a couple of my players, actually being scared actively prevents them from participating fully in a horror game.

I wouldn't run one of my psychological horror games for someone who didn't enjoy it, or iffy situations like an open con game.  For those, that's where something like "zombie survival in Disneyland" -- where the players are amused but the characters are scared -- fit in.<br/><br/>There are definitely two different schools of thought here -- something I've known in the back of my head but never really thought consciously about.  I'm really enjoying this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58642/#Comment_58642" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T01:25:04+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  1:25AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once I GMed a Kult game and my players really "liked" it, because it freaked them out. I couldn't do it since again. It was a "simple" thing: the PCs were trapped in there personal pockethell and sometimes different monsters appeared in human's shape and did some strange things.<br/><br/>I think the elements that freaked them out were:<br/><br/>1) There are some topics that if you just mention some go pale. (For me it's medical things, like needles and tumors.) You should find out what those are and use them without shame. The players have to go pale, not the characters. (It is the players' horror, not the characters'. Like, Nightmare on Elm Street is a horror for the audience not the characters.) The characters can even go boldly through fire while the players are cushing behind things.<br/><br/>2) Strange things happen that the players don't understand, but want to really understand. For example they were kidnapped then brutally kicked and hitted, then released.<br/><br/>3) I showd only glimpses of the real faces of the monsters. So if a human showed up that of they knew he was a monster, I didn't tell them any monstrous thing, they invented every horroristic detail for themselves. It is like how Bilbo behaves in Many Meetings when sees the One Ring. It is only one moment but from that on you pity Bilbo for what he became.<br/><br/>Things like this.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, and I wasn't sittin, too. I wasn't looming over the player's, but I was just peripathetical walking around and "telling the story" then waiting for reactions. And there were no dice thrown. Everything was decided by me as GM. There was not a moment when I felt that my sense of reality is not enough: there were no fights with monsters, no skill checks, we had no character sheets, only the setting, me, the story and the players. I don't know if that added something to the horrorishness, but maybe.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
