The DM flips a card off the "Social" deck. "Suspicious Guard. Half the players must make Disguise, Bluff or Streetwise checks." After that, "Hungry! All players must pay for food."

It takes a DC 15 to climb up here, but if you make it, from the next round all your missile attacks will receive +2 for the rest of the encounter".<br/>"There's three casks of oil over here. Break them apart or throw them down with a DC 20, or else make an AC 20 melee attack for 4+ HP of damage, and this 10x20 foot area over there becomes slippery: -2 AC to all enemies in the area, DC 15 acrobatics checks to remain upright and not fall."<br/><br/>etc. <br/><br/>I'd love to see those in cards. Like, I'd basically make a large card deck with three sections: Top is Dungeon, Middle is Wilderness, Bottom is City.<br/><br/>At the beginning of every encounter, the DM draws four cards and plays at least one of them. These will add "things" to the field. Like, one card might look like this:<br/><br/>OAO<br/>OXO<br/>XXX<br/>XOX<br/><br/>(all the above are "squares" with X'es darkened, O'es empty, and A = a bright square)<br/><br/>Dungeon: The A square is a rotting tapestry featuring the faded image of a knight with red eyes behind a helmeted head. An arcane lore DC 20 check from within 3 squares will reveal the name of the knight. When spoken, necrotic energy will erupt from the tapestry, and do 2d8 damage to all standing in the marked area.<br/>Wilderness: The A square is a forgotten idol of a dark God, with a jibbering viseage which leaks a purplish, thick sludge that is pooling in the marked area. Anyone who steps on the marked area is Slowed.<br/>City: The A square is a raised platform above a tavern or inn that features limited visibility into the surrounding area. A climbing check at DC 20 is required to make it to the platform, but from there all ranged attacks made in the marked squares receive +5 to attack. From the A square, a melee-weapon using character may leap onto any enemy in the marked areas as a standard attack, getting +5 to attack and doing an addition [Weapon] damage.<br/><br/>Then the DM decides where to fit these things into the encounter. At least one needs to be implemented, but all four cards may be used if needed. The GM marks the board appropriately.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215219/#Comment_215219" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T21:33:47+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  9:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Errantry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Errantry: A Storygame of Medieval Quests</a>, I took Clinton's fine Solar System and removed the GM, partly by the cunning use of an ordinary deck of cards which generated fully statted NPCs to encounter in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>If you organize your lookup tables well, custom cards may be less necessary.<br/><br/>But you couldn't make much money that way, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215272/#Comment_215272" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T06:35:47+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  6:35AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not snark at all!

Here are some reasons you might submit a spell:<br/>1. Because you know what kind of magic you want your (or someone else\u2019s) character to have and think of a spell you'd like them to be able to cast.<br/>2. Because you think a certain spell is emblematic of or enriches your group\u2019s setting in some way.<br/>3. Because you have a cool idea for a magical effect you\u2019d like to see realized in play.</blockquote>\nSource: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17764.0" rel="nofollow">[Class/Level Fantasy Game] Spell Deck Mechanics</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dhunton" title="dhunton"><img alt="dhunton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dhunton">dhunton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230813/#Comment_230813" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T10:13:19+00:00" title="September  9, 2009 10:13AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, guys, good news... this has been done.
