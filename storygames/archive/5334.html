It is the first time it has been translated into English and it is as close as is now possible to the world of the Mughal campfire - those night gatherings of soldiers, Sufis, musicians and camp followers one sees in Mughal miniatures - a storyteller beginning his tale in the clearing of a forest as the embers of the blaze glow red and eager, firelit faces crowd around."<br/><br/>Seems like there could be some gaming goodness there.  Has anyone read it and can give opinions?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hjarA8Pqzkw/RzMWdJz8ZAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/qnRuGv6V9u4/s1600-h/amirhamza.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
