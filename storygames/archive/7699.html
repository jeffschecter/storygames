As I read through it, two things struck me pretty hard:<br/>1) While it is very GMful (ha, no shit!), it seems to provide a LOT of player agency in character creation... so much so that there's not even rules for character creation (until BUTT H\u014dL). The authors seem to think whatever the players think is "right" for power-level and special abilities and such is... well, up to them (i.e. no canon).<br/>2) Over and over again, the authors emphasize that their system is really simple so that you can focus on roleplaying (they mean "acting") and story telling, not chart referencing or "crunch" in general.<br/><br/>So I ask: could H\u014dL be one of the first "story games" (as in shared-authority, high-narrative-focus)? Or is it just so rules light that they THINK it enables such play (but lacks real systemic hooks to GUARANTEE such play)?<br/>-----<br/>Oh, and anyone in the Triangle (NC) area want to play some H\u014dL? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni" title="First Oni"><img alt="First Oni" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni">First Oni</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170958/#Comment_170958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:34:15+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I freakin' loved that game.

I'd say it was very much a Story game, cause it was all about just being as messed up as possible, without regard for actual rules. I ran a few sessions of it and it ended very quickly, but i can definitely see it as an awesome one-shot type game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thirdeyegames.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdeyegames.net</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170962/#Comment_170962" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:42:17+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:42AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 11:42AM by Marshall Burns.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The book was really funny, and the art was really good, but there's not really a game there.  All the times where it says, "but it's not about the numbers, it's about the roleplaying!" are a tongue-in-cheek satire of other game texts that say that.  They also make me scream at the sky, "THEN WHY NOT MAKE THE NUMBERS ABOUT THE ROLEPLAYING?" but that's just me.<br><br>I don't understand how anyone could actually play it, even though apparently people have.  The damage rules are <i>really really</i> convoluted, the exploding dice (upon rolling 12 on 2d6) make for some really wacked-out probability curves.  Although I gotta admit that I liked how you could judge how difficult something was by the words the GM used to describe it.  Like when he describes your target as being "really really really really far away," you can count the "really"s and know how hard of a shot that is. That's both hilarious and brilliant.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170980/#Comment_170980" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T12:28:13+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 12:28PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 12:28PM by eruditus.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved HOL.

They don't really do much of anything mechanically that drive story forward.  The text suggests "yeah, we're all about actual roleplaying" but the rules suggest otherwise.  It's really not mechanically any different than D&amp;D in most respects - heavy combat system, task based resolution, locked in power lists, completely GM driven complete with metaplot, suggested GM fiat, Rule Zero, and heavily secrets oriented.  It's doesn't get much more trad than this.  The morality stats try to hint at mechanically move story forward but they uaually and easily get ignored with no consequence to the integrity of the mechanics.  I am pretty certain Ron Edwards talked about this back in the day and I think Clyde or Rob brought it up again in a recent interview.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170993/#Comment_170993" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T12:57:20+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 12:57PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure--I was being tongue in cheek a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170995/#Comment_170995" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T12:57:34+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 12:57PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg Costikyan wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toon_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">the first story game</a> in 1984.

It worked just as well as any other game we played back then, and I'd say it's just as traditional as Vampire, for what that's worth. It's the "less rules to interfere with our storytelling/acting" with some "sim" added in so its not <i>too</i> improv.<br><br/>Still, the game is satire first, playable game second.
