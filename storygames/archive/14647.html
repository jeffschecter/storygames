When I asked one person in particular, what would they find interesting in a game, the answer was "NPCs that are awesome! Ones that a character can really say 'I wanna be like that guy!' or 'I really want to kill that guy!'" After thinking about it, and thinking about it some more, with a little pondering mixed in, I started to wonder if it was actually possible to instill the NPC awesomeness that we learn through personal experience, trial, error, and good role-playing, into some kind of set of guidelines that would help the fledgling GM? In essence, making an "NPC How-To" guide? I mean, it's one thing having a list of wants and moves, a la Apocalypse World, but it is another thing entirely to take a few words representing an NPC and turn it into a major character. Or is it?<br/>So, anyway, let's see what the mighty consiousness that is Story Games can come up with!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333194/#Comment_333194" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T12:20:53+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 12:20PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...<br/>And I'm not sure how the hell this discussion ended up double-posting.<br/>Weird...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333206/#Comment_333206" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:17:25+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:17PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 1:20PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a tough question for me. Because I can't really think of NPCs easily out of context. What makes an NPC awesome, in my mind, is that the players have a strong emotional connection to them: they love them or hate them, either way they have a vested interest in who they are and what they do.<br/><br/>So, I think what "makes an NPC awesome" is about the way they react to or act to cause a reaction from the protagonists. <br/><br/>My favourite personal "trick" is to have the players invent the NPCs, and then for me to throw in some kind of twist. They'll usually give you some clue when they want one, too: for instance, if a player says, "I learned swordsmanship from old Master Yelgar, a bearded, stooped man with a missing eye who disappears for a month every Spring without ever telling anyone where he's going." So, you give them the old swordmaster and come up with something unusual that requires him a month's secrecy. The player just asked for it, right? I promise you they'll be *really* excited to find out where he goes every Spring, pretty much guaranteed.<br/><br/>If lacking the buy-in or investment from the players, then all you have to go by is your own bag of tricks: do you have a fun accent you can do? An idea for an unusual character? An idea for a straightforward, stereotypical/archetypical character? A favourite actor or character from a movie?<br/><br/>I worked for a Shakespeare production a couple of years ago; they were putting on Julius Caesar. The guy who played Mark Anthony modeled his delivery on the way Barack Obama speaks in public. It wasn't dead obvious to anyone (until he told us), but it gave his Mark Anthony a very different kind of persona, a unique style. <br/><br/>In general, though, I like Vincent's advice in Apocalypse World: give your NPCs straightforward, obvious desires. This gives you something easy to do with them, and later, when you react to stuff the PCs do, those NPCs will develop some more interesting features in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333207/#Comment_333207" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:24:35+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:24PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An awesome PC to interact with.<br/><br/>And a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anomalous/4289070653/in/gallery-94313484@N00-72157624580530170/" rel="nofollow">great portrait</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333208/#Comment_333208" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:25:33+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:25PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>My favourite personal "trick" is to have the players invent the NPCs, and then for me to throw in some kind of twist.

And if you don't see one, ask.<br/><br/>Even lacking an obvious opening like the old swordmaster, there'll generally be a larger issue you can grab and use.<br/><br/>For example, imagine one of your players says their character has a lover who is an escaped slave of the Wortigons. Even if that's all you know, you can be at least somewhat certain they'll enjoy dealing with NPCs and situations related to Wortigons and their slaves. After all the player invented this bit about the escaped slave: what are the odds their character will say, "Wortigons own slaves? OK, I don't really have an opinion on that one way or another."<br/><br/>So give them a relative of the escaped slave who <i>loves</i> serving the Wortigons or even works for them, helping them catch and sell more slaves. Give them a nasty bounty hunter who is looking for the escaped slave. And maybe take one of the other NPCs, someone another player came up with, and give them some shady connection, some dark deal they brokered with Wortigon slaver.<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>Usually you'll get way more juice than "escaped slave for a lover", though. And if not, you can ask question until you do.<br/><br/>I like to create as much of my game stuff as possible (as a GM) from stuff the players say about their characters. It's so easy and so rewarding. Ideally, there's almost nothing in the game at all that wasn't somehow inspired by something one of the players said or some feature of one of the characters. From one player I know there are Wortigons and that they own slaves. From another I learn there is an underground business dealing in narcotics. From a third, a trading empire looking to overthrow the throne. Great: I have the Monarch on the throne selling slaves to the Wortigons in exchange for peace, the revolutionaries trying to overthrow are all addicted to those narcotics and dependent on the underground mafia, etc, etc... and we have a game, just like that.<br/><br/>(This is all for a very specific style of gaming, of course! But it works in many situations and many different ways.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333217/#Comment_333217" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:51:40+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:51PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much depends on the group. John Wick says "Never physically describe NPCs".  My group says "Jason, physically describe all your NPCs!"  Everyone's imaginations work a different way.  So here's the mix that works for my group:<br/><br/>* A vivid physical description. (My next game will have portraits, I'm working on it!)<br/>* A name on a card in the middle of the table.  (No one EVER remembers an NPC name without this, not EVER.)<br/>* A clear voice that is differentiated from JDC's normal speaking voice.  Could be an accent, an odd way of talking, a tic where they wave their hand or index finger in the air, etc.<br/>* A clear goal, not necessarily for or against the player characters' goals, but something they are pushing for and cannot easily achieve.<br/><br/>Sometimes I have a perfect storm of all of these, sometimes I have a mix of a few, and those are lesser standouts. Some NPCs just give 'em the key to the dungeon and have none of these, they are not really characters when you come right down to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333218/#Comment_333218" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:55:21+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:55PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to remember a piece of advice from a script writing course or something like that:<br/><br/>Give most characters one character trait. (E.g. "Brave", "Lunatic", "Shy", etc.)<br/><br/>Give major characters two such character traits, which contradict each other. (E.g. Brave and Cowardly, Shy and Obnoxious, Lunatic and Practical, etc.)<br/><br/>Each such contradiction raises an important question and gives you a lot to work with. But it's really just for the most important, central characters. <br/><br/>Most of the casr get by just fine with one character trait. Think of your favourite TV show or whatever: there'll be "the sexy one", and "the brainy one", and "the one who hates the cops", and so on. Only the major major characters get more than that, so we can focus on it (and in your game, that'll be mostly the PCs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333223/#Comment_333223" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T14:22:22+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  2:22PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 2:23PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An awesome NPC wants what a PC wants. Pick a goal that a PC is pursuing. The NPC has genuine, heartfelt enthusiasm for the same goal, but is completely incompetent about pursuing it due to some personal limitations. Maybe they don't really understand how to get it, maybe they're naive about the thing itself, maybe they're just a fuck-up -- but they absolutely believe that That Goal is the best goal to have. They are a way to expose the folly of the PC's goals, or affirm their ultimate merit.<br/><br/>An awesome NPC understands something about a PC in a way nobody else does. Maybe it's a common past they share, or a philosophical viewpoint, but the NPC is the best person to talk to about that thing, and they judge it as fairly and sympathetically as they can. They are a way to share your insights, as a GM, about aspects of the PCs that you have spent some time thinking about.<br/><br/>An awesome NPC is genuinely curious about a PC, a curiousity which is orthogonal to their desire to oppose or support the PC. They want to know why the PC is doing what she's doing, and they are not afraid to ask, even at the most awkward moments. They are a surrogate for your own curiousity, as a GM, about the player characters.<br/><br/>An awesome NPC thinks a PC is sexy, and is not cutesy or obsessive about the fact. They want to get it on with the PC if at all possible, but that's not the only thing going on with them, either. They take 'no' for an answer but that doesn't cause them to vanish from the story afterwards, and neither does 'yes.'<br/><br/>An awesome NPC is a way to affirm that the PCs are the protagonists, that they are the most interesting and most sympathetic part of the story, and that as a result we care about all the different parts of them, not just the parts that drive the superficial action of the plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333227/#Comment_333227" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T14:36:43+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  2:36PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 3:04PM by stefoid.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Im interested in this too.<br/><br/>Im not sure if this makes the NPC awesome, but one trick for making relevant PCs is to have them like and help the PCs to generate sympathy and then threaten them so the PCs feel obligated.<br/><br/>I think  you should give important NPCs 3 or 4 motivations to help make them behave realistically.<br/><br/>Motivations are different from traits though.

NPCs who avoid contact with the PCs rarely catch on: they really need to get all up in the PC's business in order to get enough traction to become awesome.  So step one for me is always finding reasons for the NPCs to initiate conversations and conflicts and to have some kind of opinion about the PCs, just to get them to where maybe some magic could happen.  The opinion part seems like a good jump-starter, too; our group really loves NPCs who feel strongly about their PCs...or at the very least, they pay more attention to them, which is almost as good.<br/><br/>Once that hurdle is jumped, I'm all about giving NPCs easily-identifiable handles.  Maybe it's a verbal or physical tic, maybe it's a visual cue, maybe it's a big, clearly identifiable goal that the PCs can recognize from a mile away.  This is the icebreaker, the thing that will get the players at the table to say "Oh yeah, that's the guy who spends all his time in the kennels singing to the dogs," or "That's the mayor's wife, the one that's a total sexual predator," or whatever.  My only goal is to get that one thing to stick in their mind, so that when their thoughts turn towards the NPCs in this game, they have at least one distinct thing that they can say about each one.<br/><br/>And then whenever that NPC comes back, I try to fold something new into the mix, to give them another distinct thing they can remember that NPC by, hopefully something that's a bit out of step with the first trait they remember (contradictions are great NPC material, as noted above).  Now it's the guy who sings to dogs and is inexplicably treated with great deference by the army's commander, now it's the sexpot wife who gets really hyper and weird when she's not in public.  This is usually where I start getting the first inkling about whether an NPC is becoming awesome or not: if the players really seize onto that second trait, then I'm probably onto something.<br/><br/>After that, I'm just elaborating on the NPC, fine-tuning my performance and inventing backstory and constantly re-assessing how that NPC feels about the PCs based on what they know about what's happened so far.  And that's really where the NPC becomes awesome <i>to me</i>, because now I'm really getting to play that character in more interesting circumstances and we're all getting better scenes out of it.  And that kind of enthusiasm is infectious: the more the players think an NPC is awesome, the more awesome the NPC becomes for me, which makes them think the NPC is even more awesome.  At least, assuming I don't fuck it up, in which case they lose interest in that guy and I have to remind myself to let it go and go back to flinging new NPCs at them until another one sticks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333231/#Comment_333231" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T14:59:45+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  2:59PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I try to think of the actor/actress that would play the NPC.

It's not as specific as a goal; it's an adjective.  Stuff like to be respected/feared/loved/successful/rich/pure.<br/><br/>The foible is what keeps them from attaining that passion.  They are too fearful/shy/hot-headed/obsessed with details/by-the-book/mean/selfish/loving to achieve their passion.<br/><br/>The virtue is what redeems them from their foible (in the eyes of the audience). They are kind/very competent/highly knowledgeable/empathic/honest.<br/><br/>You put the three together in a matter of moments, and you get a deep interplay and a sympathetic-and-tragic character to play out.  For example, the tax collector who wants to be loved, but he's too pedantic and obsessed with enforcing the tax laws on everyone (including his family), but you've got to admire how good he is with numbers. The assassin who wants to be feared, but he's too incompetent, yet he's also very kind, even to his targets. The teenager who wants to be respected but makes bad choices all the time, but she is so sincere and tries really hard. The singer who wants to be famous but is too shy, yet he is super encouraging to others. The mage apprentice who wants to be the best sorcerer around, except he is too hot-headed and has no patience, but he's ultra-gifted. The priest who wants to be dignified, but he's a real asshole to everyone, yet he's brutally honest and really just says what everyone else is thinking.<br/><br/>I just pulled these out of my ass without even thinking, and I'd actually like to see several of these in action. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333376/#Comment_333376" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T13:14:44+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  1:14PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2011 9:38PM by stupidgremlin.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>You put the three together in a matter of moments, and you get a deep interplay and a sympathetic-and-tragic character to play out.

Well, at least, they are pretty darned close (Sorcerous Stabber Orphen, Rune Soldier Louie, Detroit Metal City, etc. etc. etc.).<br/><br/>Consider this added on like a Lego brick to the list of guidelines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333380/#Comment_333380" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T13:31:56+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  1:31PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>The passion is what they want to achieve.

Well, as far as virtues being 'good complicators'.  Like if you are compassionate or always believe in defending the weak, for example, then it can be a complicator for that character in certain situations.  <br/><br/>It is more interesting to have antagonists have 'good complicators' and protagonists to have 'bad complciators' so describing as foible and viture is quite neat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
