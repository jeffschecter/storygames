A snip-it of the musing can be found below:\n<blockquote>I have talked about the positive effects of role-playing in previous blog posts. Discussing how it improves social skills and expand one\u2019s understanding of the world around them. While that is all well and good, I got to thinking. Is the act of role-playing intrinsically enjoyable?<br/><br/>Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I am not saying that role-playing can\u2019t be fun, I am more saying that exterior factors generate the fun, not the act of getting in character. Thinking back on my experiences with role-playing games, the enjoyment always seems to stem from something other than pretending to be a fictional character. It comes from out witting an opponent in an argument, telling stories with friends, or even overcoming mechanically challenging situations within the game. And while each of these actions are strung together and enhanced by role-playing, they still stand-up without it. But can the same be said for role-playing? Is the sole act of acting like another person fun? If it is, why? Where does this enjoyment come from? Truthfully I haven\u2019t come to a full conclusion on this and would love to hear your opinion on the matter in the comments below.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443355/#Comment_443355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T16:50:46+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  4:50PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have anything to add, necessarily, but I think this is a very interesting question, as it goes directly to the heart of Rickard's issues with rewards/bribes.

I recall when I was a kid and roleplayed tv characters when I was playing alone, I liked to get into their way of thinking and even act the part a bit. It had such an influence for me that I even do this sort of empathy when I get to see a good movie and come out from it feeling like the main character. Of course, sharing this with others by actively portraying the character is another kind of fun which is rewarded when others recognisce it, but that's totally different from what I stated above.<br/><br/>Could I translate it to RPGs? yes, though I dunno how much other people can. It's a matter of having empathy with the character and using the school of acting of getting into the mind of the character to interpretate it, something not many people feels comfortable doing or at least expressing before others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L" title="Patrick_L"><img alt="Patrick_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/999/nLXZTS67FSGIK.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L">Patrick_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443363/#Comment_443363" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T17:36:26+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  5:36PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a> You may be right about me tying creative agendas into this and this is why I brought the question here.

However, your examples all seem to be achievement-based. I don't think it's that simple.<br/><br/>When a player steps into a role and acts like another person, that fictional person does things:\n<ul><li>explores the fictional setting</li>\n<li>interacts with other fictional characters, controlled by other players (GM or otherwise)</li>\n<li>explores one's own fictional mindspace (the emotions and thoughts of the fictional character)</li></ul>\nNote that these things can include your achievements (exploring the fictional setting includes facing and possibly overcoming the challenges the setting produces).<br/><br/>All of these things are <i>learning</i>. I subscribe to Raph Koster's "Theory of Fun" that posits that learning opportunities are what propel fun game play. Exploration of character, of setting, of situation, of system, and so on--these are learning. This is the value proposition of an RPG. <br/><br/>An RPG lets you learn about yourself and your world (your real self, your real world) through the metaphor of the game and its fiction. It's a safe space to try out things you can't necessarily do (or wouldn't want to do) in real life. That is, it's "play," and play is learning, and learning is fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443372/#Comment_443372" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T19:26:29+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  7:26PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 7:27PM by creases.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part, as a kid, I never needed rules, instructions or incentives to play make-believe, either with my friends or on my own. Of course it was intrinsically enjoyable!<br/><br/>I would also say, for as long as recorded history, people have sought out opportunities to play roles, and have paid money to see others play roles. Plato was talking about <i>mimesis</i> and play as the basis for all art in the 3rd century BCE.<br/><br/>(Quite a bit of early drama emerged in the context of religious festivals, where the experience of role-playing was regarded not only as intrinsically worthwhile, but even sacred.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, for just as long, people have been writing instructions to guide role-playing, in the form of scripts.<br/><br/>We don't need rules\u2014I mean, we don't <i>need</i> them. I think maybe the question we're orbiting might be better expressed: does our role playing <i>benefit</i> from rules, directions and incentives? And I think the answer to that, interestingly, is: it depends, on a lot of things! It's highly contextual. And it depends on the kind of rule. And who the intended beneficiary is. (Eg. Is a given rule supposed to make role-playing more enjoyable for you? or for other players? etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443375/#Comment_443375" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T19:53:57+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  7:53PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, there's no need for an incentive when it comes for the lone fun part of roleplaying. It's because there's another kind of fun there that come from the empathic side. When you engage with a good piece of fiction where there's a protagonist you can feel related to, the victory of that character becomes your victory and you experience things trough that character. It's not he same source, but the same feeling when you root for a team and you see them win. You don't do a thing but identify yourself with one person or a group; you take a side and when that side wins, you feel like you have won too. You can even share that emotion if you're exposed to the same situation with another person. So, no need for extra reward here, that feeling is a reward in itself. <br/><br/>Now, when "doing something" becomes a part of the equation, that's a completely different thing. As pointed before, it can even overwhelm and make dissapear the feeling I described above, depending on how much of an interruption the activity represents, and if there is any reinforcement to that feeling from other people. When you "do something" as facing a mental challenge or a social one when you try to communicate by acting, then the feeling of getting something done, and/or the acknowledgement and rewards become important. Often, more imprtant than the lonely fun. (but again, if you're having fun in group, why would we focus on having lone fun on top of it, unless we're really unconfortable in the group and need some escape from it. I've seen that happen too)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443377/#Comment_443377" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T20:15:04+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  8:15PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rules in RPGs tend to create constraints that are a breeding ground for creativity. Without rules, freeform role-play tends to go all over the place. Sometimes freeform RPGs are overwhelming without constraints that force people to think outside the box. Anyone who has ever faced the task like "draw anything you want" vs. "draw an anthropomorphic rodent doing something cute" knows the power of constraint to get creative juices firing. So rules provide constraints that add value to role-play.<br/><br/>Rules provide incentives, too. Do you strictly need them? Probably not. An incentive is a bribe to do something that you could do without the reward, right? But incentives are proven to work to get people to do things. In an RPG, this can get people with different goals all on the same page. Just try to play D&amp;D 4e for character development and not for all the cool combatty stuff for 4-5 levels and see how the incentive system pushes you pretty damned hard towards a specific style of play. Incentives get everyone on the same page, which can be very valuable as a signaling device to players. Not being on the same page can ruin the fun, so incentives that align player goals provide much value to producing fun.<br/><br/>Rules also provide physics--that is, how a setting works--via mechanics or prosaic description. Sure, you could make all of that stuff up on the fly, and lots of people do, but having a default to fall back on in the system itself frees up creative brain power for other things. If resolving questions of "physics" (in the sense I'm using it) isn't fun for you, then a rules system that helps with that part makes the game more fun for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443380/#Comment_443380" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T20:24:02+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  8:24PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a "how you decide to slice it" kind of thing. I mean one can keep dissecting any activity to determine if the activity itself is the source of the pleasure or something else (do boxers love boxing or do they love hitting and being hit?). At a certain point though, all of those things do go into the definition of the thing itself. So I really think the answer to this question is just a matter of how one conceptualizes the experience and what one focuses on. For me, the most striking thing about RPGs from the moment I first played them, was the sense of "being there" in the shoes of another person in another place. I could probably analyze this further but for me it is sufficient to say Roleplaying and immersion are what I am after when I play and the source of my enjoyment (and of course those contain other things that could be analyzed separately---but I don't think that eliminates roleplaying from the equation unless you can find me an activity that brings them all together in exactly the same way as being immersed in character does for me).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443381/#Comment_443381" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T20:29:05+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  8:29PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

We had no dice, no formal system, just "you are a player and Dave is the GM."  That was it.  I told him where he was and what gear he had.  He announced an action.  I told him the result.  He loved it.  I loved it too!  That was the whole deal -- two people going back and forth over stuff that they're imagining.  <br/><br/>Heck, it probably would have still been fun if his character had done nothing!  Just transporting yourself to a different place, and having that place come alive from a friend's description -- it's like watching a movie / reading a book <i>and</i> having a conversation, all at once!<br/><br/>Of course, for those of us who have done this a lot*, we form other goals and standards.  Once you know you can beat a mission or imitate a Coen Bros movie or whatever, it's easy to lose the joy of <i>just</i> playing pretend.<br/><br/>As for the more specific thread prompt about "acting like another person", well, that sounds to me like we have fiction and action, so I'd say, yes, inherently fun.

This happens in every game where your character is more or less guaranteed to be competent, to mostly "win", and to not die unless the player consents.<br/><br/>And with regards to playing without other people, that happens as well, for example during computer games where people spontaneously come to make decisions according to their character's imagined personality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443577/#Comment_443577" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T21:32:05+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  9:32PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2015 9:33PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, are you sticking with your original statement about the limits of just playing pretend, or agreeing with my statement that all you need to make it endlessly fun is other people, or neither, or both?

Even lacking a juvenile wish-fulfillment priority, I think it's still pretty easy to get that "being awesome" kick out of roleplay.

Their eyes light up, and they get very excited.<br/><br/>Adults don't, because we're suspicious about the value of the activity, as well as the possible social cost for engaging in it (i.e. people will think we're not "cool").<br/><br/>I've recently been in several all-adult group classes where we were asked to do weird things like "pretend you're wearing a really fancy hat" or "pretend you're throwing sparkles from your feet", but for medical or professional reasons - a trusted authority figure was telling us to do these things along with the suggestion that there was a good reason to engage in them.<br/><br/>Everyone tried doing them, and almost everyone smiled, laughed, and enjoyed themselves, far more than they expected. Afterwards, a great number said things like, "Wow! I can't believe how much I enjoyed that. Why am I smiling so much? Do we have to stop now, or can we keep doing it?"<br/><br/>If you doubt this, try something: go to the local bar/library/your job, and challenge yourself to spend 10 minutes as someone completely different from yourself. You'll earn thrills, you'll be tempted to laugh, you'll be challenged, and you will learn things. It's quite an interesting and "fun" activity!\n<blockquote>All you really need is one player saying, "My guy does a cool thing!" and another player (or computer environment) saying, "Yes!

We do them automatically, without training or guidance.  Remove them, and you're not playing pretend, you're just daydreaming.    <br/><br/>We all have Characters to be and Places to traverse and Situations to address and a System that tells you not to talk over me constantly or undo what I just did or whatever.

He was a demigod transforming a primitive continent into a badass society primed to make war on its neighbors.  I'd tell him a hurdle his people faced, he'd come up with some colorful way to solve it and earn their worship; then he'd tell me a new policy he'd institute, and I'd describe the immediate response and then the eventual consequences.  This remained fun for half a year or so until he quit the paper route.  No rules, and it wasn't just a novelty thing, as we'd played RPGs together before.  Just a fictional premise and a creative division of labor and go!  It was great.  I would do it again today if I had the opportunity.

You are essentially removing integral aspects of roleplaying to argue that roleplaying isn't intrinsically entertaining. We are not talking rolls or mechanics here, we are talking about something as simple as having a sense of the setting you are in, the character you are playing and why you are there. Those are not additions to roleplaying, those are part of roleplaying. For the act of roleplaying as I understand it, is intrinsically entertaining. It is sort of like John Wick's recent article where he tries to prove D&amp;D isn't a roleplaying game, it is that kind of reasoning in my view. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443719/#Comment_443719" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T15:31:21+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  3:31PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretending to be someone else feels great and I wish it would never end                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443747/#Comment_443747" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T21:45:01+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  9:45PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We all have Characters to be and Places to traverse and Situations to address and a System that tells you not to talk over me constantly or undo what I just did or whatever.

I think System evolves naturally as a result of doing stuff together. However, I think that you can play pretend together without them; you just can't keep it going for long. It doesn't stop being role-playing because I keep undoing what you did--it just stops being fun for you. I suspect game texts result as a system for creating fun more reliably, so you don't have to reinvent all that stuff every time.<br/><br/>So at what point do we draw a useful line between "just playing pretend" and "playing and RPG"? Is there a useful line, or are they the same activity? <br/><br/>If they're essentially the same, then the OP is sorta moot. Or maybe the question is, "Do we really need all this system crap for role-playing to be fun?" and I'm pretty sure I think the answer is "No, of course not. Fiasco RPG proved that." <br/><br/>And then we bicker about the line some more, and I talk about the "Still Life" LARP about pretending to be rocks with existential questions, which is clearly role-playing, but is it "just playing pretend"? I suppose it's an example of role-playing being intrinsically fun, at least, but there's still structure there. <br/><br/>I guess my position is "Yeah, of course role-playing is intrinsically fun, but I don't think it's generally sustainable for all of the reasons that RPGs exist in the first place."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443748/#Comment_443748" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T22:00:48+00:00" title="March  5, 2015 10:00PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.  Makes sense to me!<br/><br/>One random thought, though:<blockquote>It doesn't stop being role-playing because I keep undoing what you did--it just stops being fun for you. I suspect game texts result as a system for creating fun more reliably, so you don't have to reinvent all that stuff every time.</blockquote>I think various games have done fantastic jobs of covering certain vital bases of System, but generally <i>not</i> the bases you need to cover for just playing pretend.  Published RPGs are more likely to have rules for how we decide if a character succeeds or gets what they wants, in a way that no one playing will contest... whereas functional playing pretend is more likely to have rules (or, well, habits) for who gets to talk how much, and when, and about what.  I think this is where Puppetland and Swords Without Master are perhaps more intuitive than D&amp;D when it comes to taking Play Pretend and beginning to add structure.  If people came to those "rules about talking" games first, I wonder if D&amp;D would look like it does.  Or maybe this is just apples &amp; oranges...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445090/#Comment_445090" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-04T16:32:05+00:00" title="May  4, 2015  4:32PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My position would be that no, role-playing is not intrinsically fun (or even pleasurable) as an activity.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I was on these boards, but I'd have to agree with CarpeGuitarrem in that some stories, like the aforementioned Russian novels, and even my game, <i>Terribly Beautiful</i>, are very different. They are not usually fun to play. The point of playing them is exploring and building empathy with the characters who are going through very painful and complex situations. An additional reason to play them is to contrast them with a more privileged life like my own.<br/><br/>At the same time, that doesn't mean that role-playing can't be fun, but fun is such a vague word that it means little on its own. In his book <i>Designing Games</i>, Sylvester tried to explain and explore "fun," but he failed to analyze his own choices in using that word. Giving a similar treatment to "empathy" might have resulted in a very different book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
