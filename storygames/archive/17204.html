The first person to think of it gets to go first and tells everyone else how having the baby jaguar will make them happy. They then ask who wants to go next and picks from those who have not yet shared and so on until everyone has shared.<br/><br/>Then the first player must begin the story of how they they will find the baby jaguar with a sentence beginning "I got a star ..."<br/>After the player has said their sentence, the next player clockwise must say one of these ritual phrases: <br/><br/>* Make a wish - The player to your left must say what makes them happy, without having the baby jaguar. Then it is their turn to say a sentence about how they will find the baby jaguar.<br/><br/>* Make a wish for a boy - Select any player who has not spoken recently and they must say what would make them happy about having a new son or brother. Then it is their turn to say a sentence about how they will find the baby jaguar.<br/><br/>* Make a wish for a girl - Select any player who has not spoken recently and they must say what would make them happy about having a new daughter or sister. Then it is their turn to say a sentence about how they will find the baby jaguar.<br/><br/>* I love you - the last player gains one love token towards completing their search for the baby jaguar and it is now the current players turn to say a sentence about how they will find the baby jaguar.<br/><br/>A player may avoid speaking in their turn by giving up one of their love tokens, if they have any.<br/><br/>Winning: The first player to get love tokens = the number of players wins.<br/><br/>Hmmm, closer to 27 mins!<br/>Edit: Obviously highly inspired by Happy Birthday Robot                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390304/#Comment_390304" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T17:31:26+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  5:31PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Third Time's the Charm<br/><br/>You live in a fairytale kingdom and fate has chosen you to participate in one of the stories. You might be a talking animal or a young heir to the throne or a wizened old wizard or, as is traditional, the runt of the litter (of whom anyone despairs of ever expecting anything.)<br/><br/>But things are about to change. Introduce yourself to the other fairytale people who live in the village with you, that'd be the other players. When you introduce yourself, warn the player on your right not to do something. Tell them not to look in the cupboard or to wash their spaniel or to cross the old bridge, anything you like, but keep it simple.<br/><br/>You may ignore the warning you were just given and skip ahead to the dangerous part of the game or carefully heed your friend's advice, but if you do, you must provide a more pressing errand that you plan to perform. This can be anything from fairytales, from taking food to your poor old hungry granny to rescuing a kidnapped relative to finding the dancing water and the talking bird and... whatever the third thing was.<br/><br/>Now comes the dangerous part of the story. Turn to the player on your left and explain the horrible consequences they've brought down upon themselves for their foolish choice. Chide them for anything you like, from being turned into a frog to getting trapped in a land full of giants to having their hands cut off and being accused of giving birth to puppies.<br/><br/>For the rest of the game, you will have to work to make things right again. But, since you are being Taught a Valuable Lesson, any significant thing you try to fix the situation will not work the first or even the second time.  If you try any task you have not tried at least two times before, in recent order, each other player must suggest one thing that went wrong with it. Pick the answer you like best and acknowledge your defeat. In order to accomplish any task from now until the end of the game, you must attempt it three times in a row. On the third try, explain to everyone else what was different This Third Time and why you succeeded this time around.<br/><br/>Once someone has undone the difficulties they brought down on themselves in the first part of the game, the game is over.<br/>Everyone should discuss what they learned and, perhaps, console eachother with cookies.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390790/#Comment_390790" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T09:13:33+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  9:13AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobody here trusts the word "light" do they?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390959/#Comment_390959" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T16:54:16+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  4:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Post Apocalyptic W\u0336a\u0336s\u0336t\u0336e\u0336l\u0336a\u0336n\u0336d\u0336 Wonderland</b><br/><br/>Picture your standard post-apocalyptic, desolate, barren landscape.  This is where our light game takesplace.<br/><br/>A roleplaying poem for 3-5 players, or thereabouts.  Inspired by my cat Orpheus.<br/><br/>Each player writes a goal for a PC.  Something tangible and achievable in a relatively short amount of time ("Find a new friend" instead of "eliminate world hunger").  Those drawn from real life are better.  Shuffle up the cards and deal them out.  No one can have their own card.<br/><br/>Each player comes up with a quick sketch of a character who is going to achieve this goal, or at least get closer, thanks to the hellscape they live in.  Narration rotates around the table.  Characters can interact, although they don't need to.<br/><br/>Player 1 starts and the remaining players Barf Forth Apocalyptica <sup>tm</sup>.  Tell player 1 how god awful this place is.  It's filthy, crawling with disease, filled with hostile survivors and a lack of all decency.  Player 1 takes each item and describes how it helps their character move towards their goal.  <br/><br/>Water too filthy to drink?  Great!  My PC's water purification technique should make him a popular man and help him win friends.<br/><br/>Is it raining acid?  Super, we can spend quality time inside telling stories.<br/><br/>This goes on until player 1 feels they have gotten close enough to their goal or needs a break.  Then pass narration on to player 2 and so on.  Other players can introduce their characters into any scene, either to help or hinder the narrating player OR to help their own character.<br/><br/>The basic idea is to turn every negative into a positive.  Twist everything around and put it on its head.<br/><br/>10 minutes and out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390960/#Comment_390960" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T17:00:08+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  5:00PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is full of win.

The GM represents nature, the masses, and powers aligned against you.<br/><br/>Unlike PCs in an action game, the players do things like feed the hungry or build hydro-electric dams as a action.

Now you live on the street, under a bridge, in an empty house. You live to together, like scarred humans with no hope. <br/><br/>You start the game by narrating the reason it all went wrong; help each others out here; find realistic reasons (an accident, too costly hospital bills, drugs, alcohol ... something stressful that made you break, and loose it ...).<br/><br/>Then you take turns narrating how a new president took office in the White House, one year ago, and this damn fellow is a socialist! You spit on him and his "social/commie-ideals", like so many others, but he really is a power-house of optimism and political skill. So he turns things around, for all of America! Including you; the sorry dredges at the bottom of society! You narrate what changes this new president does to the nation, how he instills hope and gets people to act on it! <br/><br/>The hope and changes seeps through to you too, and it will change your abysmal situation. Someone will come by and tell you, eventually, that you will get help. You don't believe them, of course; no one ever helps the likes of you! But still, summer is coming ...<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Now the game starts proper. You will frame scenes, and interact, and discuss conflicts and difficulties, and turn the hopeless situation of the homeless humans you play, into a tale of hope and redemption! <br/><br/>Do not make it simple and dull; make it a hard fight, with real issues and opposing forces. Such change will never be easy, neither on the personal level, nor on the national level. Still; you will do it! You will do it focussing on yourselves, not the nation. Changes taking place in <i>the nation</i> will only ever be part of this tale, from now on, through the lenses of your destinies. So keep it small, individual, human. Narrate with hope, and with a drive towards personal change!<br/><br/>Any conflicts will be resolved by rolling the die;<br/>- 1-2: failure; narrate how hopelessness once again takes hold of the humans involved in the conflict<br/>- 3-4: stalemate; narrate how you not quite succeed to reach out, turn the tables, change ... but that you may still make it, in another way; hope is not lost<br/>- 5-6: success! Narrate your change, narrate how you succeed in changing your life, with the help of others, and how the new fellowship growing in your nation makes it stronger, healthier, less filled with fear! <br/><br/>This game should be narrated towards a land and a people finding peace, love and fellowship. It should be narrated towards an idealistic society based on <b>the true balance</b> of three principles;<br/>- freedom<br/>- brotherhood<br/>- equality<br/><br/><b>Change the world to change your lives!

They are adventurous and looking for mysteries. <br/><br/>Decide up front if you are male or female, give yourself a name, and write down a short sentence describing your personality. Please keep it light hearted!<br/><br/>Next each player secretly writes down a series of secret goals:<br/><br/>1. One thing you want to do that you aren't suppose to.<br/>2. One thing you want to do that the others will not like.<br/>3. One thing that you don't want to happen.<br/>4. One place of mystery in the "castle" you are staying in.<br/>5. One thing that your uncle is doing that he doesn't want anyone to know about.<br/>6. One mysterious stranger or character (I love mean housekeepers myself).<br/>7. One thing that that stranger wants to do.<br/><br/>In the game you say what your character does but you are also trying to make the uncle and strangers do things as well. So you are really running three characters. <br/><br/>Draw a map of the locations people made up (but don't tell the mysteries!)<br/><br/>Characters may move from location to location. You move after a person stops talking.<br/><br/>You play by jumping in and saying what happens. If you don't like what another player says then jump in and challenge it. Say what happens instead. The high roller wins. Otherwise people just add to the story.

It is a light one, with a dark premise. The dark premise is necessary to make the game-play focus on hope; the existence of hope is most promising when there is none. And then; when it manifest itself, it is felt the more strongly. So USA is a game of hope! Do you know of anything lighter than hope?<br/><br/>It would make me happy if you tried it out, zircher.

Gather a candle and a reliable lighter. Sit in a crosslegged circle with your knees touching. Turn out all the lights.<br/><br/>All family members close their eyes and call to mind a fear that has affected them recently, preferably in the past week. Think about what they did or did not do because of that fear. Think about whom those actions affected besides themselves.<br/><br/>When the leader is ready, they reach out their right hand and take the left hand of the person sitting to their right. Each in turn reaches out only when they are ready. So when the person to the left of the leader takes their other hand, all are ready.<br/><br/>The leader lights the candle and holds it in front of them. They speak their fear. They speak their action. They speak the effect. The rest of the family thanks them for sharing, but says nothing else.<br/><br/>They pass the candle to right. Each in turn speaks their fear and action and effect and is thanked.<br/><br/>When everyone has had their turn, put the candle out and share a hug in the dark. Then turn the lights back on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_393117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393117/#Comment_393117" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T11:00:03+00:00" title="October 11, 2012 11:00AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beautiful game, Rob!
