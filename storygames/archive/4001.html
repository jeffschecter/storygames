After much discussion on Jesse's thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3985/" rel="nofollow">here</a> about the what he wants to know about a game in order for him to be intersted I got a better understanding of my own game. Thanks Jesse.<br/><br/>1) What is your game about?<br/><br/>unWritten is about collaboratively creating the setting, the games premise, the characters, and a stories fiction which is contrained by the hero\xe2\u20ac\u2122s journey.<br/><br/>2) What do your characters do?<br/><br/>The characters\xe2\u20ac\xa6 I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how to answer this question, because the game is settingless and premiseless the characters don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have a specific focus until the players create these things\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/><br/>3) What do the players do?<br/><br/>The players have two roles, the setting player and the acting player. The setting player frames scenes, plays the elements within it, and pushes conflicts based on the hero\xe2\u20ac\u2122s journey. The acting players interact with the scenes. At the end of each scene the role of the setting player moves to another player.<br/><br/>Now, I'm struggling to answer the 2nd question. How can this question be answered if the role of the characters aren't defined until you start playing the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
