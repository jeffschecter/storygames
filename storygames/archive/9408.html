Thought y'all might want to take a look and see if that's the sort of thing you want in on.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I don't know Randall from Adam, I just read his blog, saw the plea, and thought I'd like to spread it around, cause I strongly empathize with his situation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
