American and Danish roleplayers when it comes to character advocacy in particular. I'll try and  put Oliver's thoughts forward here, but he's around so he can chime in and correct me if I'm mis-representing him.<br/><br/>It's not really what I want to ask you guys, but for reference Oliver thinks that the American way is to root for your character to succeed and overcome obstacles, while the Danish (Nordic?) way is just as much to root for your character to fail and get knocked down, if it makes for a more interesting story. I don't quite see this split, and indeed several games endulge in making failure interesting (The Burning Games, AW etc.).<br/><br/>But following on from that, Oliver argues that some games' mechanics only work if you actively take the side of your player character and gives Polaris as an example. I don't have enough play experience with the game to judge whether he's right or wrong, so I hope some of you who have played a lot of it can help. Oliver is arguing along these lines:<br/>In Polaris it's imperative to seek possibilities for being a hero and saving the world, while the game and your opponent will make sure you fail. On this road to failure it's important to be a proponent of the hero and help him because the bigger the fall when it happens. The game mechanics are sharply built towards that, and if you step outside the whole structure fails.<br/><br/>I don't think I agree with this, but I don't have any actual play examples to show. Any thoughts, actual play examples? Is Polaris broken?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318436/#Comment_318436" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T06:04:11+00:00" title="April  2, 2011  6:04AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Polaris definitely requires character advocacy and pushing for positive shit, because your mistaken sure as hell isn't going to!

What next?"<br/><br/>It was some kind of scene with the Senate (or whatever it's called in Polaris), and my Knight was making a case. In the end, he was pierced with icicles and died. (I'm poking fun a bit here; from what I remember our game was quite serious!)<br/><br/>Anyway, it kinda fell flat because of that. There was no conflict. I remember talking about it with you two afterwards (unless it was just with Joe, but I don't think so). I'm pretty sure we considered that next time, the Mistaken might try to throw their own vision of how things should happen into play, instead.<br/><br/>But I agree with this premise, whether it has to do with Danish/American styles or something entirely different: many/most games with strong character advocacy pretty strongly assume that the player will be pushing as hard as possible for the character's success, his/her hopes and dreams (e.g. TSoY, Polaris, Apocalypse World, etc). I would imagine many games will "void the warrantee" if they are not played this way, or will require a major change in the function of the GM/antagonist role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318446/#Comment_318446" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T07:57:24+00:00" title="April  2, 2011  7:57AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Polaris is pretty clear about how it should be played, so I don't think this is a design flaw any more than AW's Principles are.

But, as Jason says, you can have that tension with two different negative or tragic outcomes being advocated.  What sometimes makes things difficult, as folks seem to be implying above, is when somebody says "And then you fall down a cliff and your arm gets crushed!" and the other player, totally on board, says, "Yes! Hurt me more! Then what?"  That's not so much about it being a problem when you push for a tragic ending, but that the players can't all be teaming up to push for similar narrative outcomes.  Some players have to be advocating for the character or just advocating for other sorts of outcomes in order for productive tension to be created, which is often critical for engaging the mechanics as well.  There's no taste of victory or defeat, no back and forth, if everybody's essentially aligned together.<br/><br/>In Polaris, the Mistaken, Heart, and Moons are set up to be pushing for different kinds of results, based on their individual roles and interests.  Sometimes the Moons are on the Heart's side, sometimes they ally with the Mistaken, sometimes they are independent.  If that doesn't happen, if the players are all similarly aligned or don't assert their individuality, then, yeah, of course it's going to fall flat.  That's one of the main points of the game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Advocating hard for the interests of your character* as your character perceives them is the most effective way to wind up with drama and interesting story.  There may be heavy elements of irony as the players realize that their character's goals are not healthy for them.  And there is often an appreciation for (and even an embracing of) that poignant moment where the tragedy hits.  But actively pursuing that tragedy...abandoning your character and rooting for their failure is toxic.  Such play isnot "playing" it is group mastabory emo-porn that could be better accomplished by writing short stories than through RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTragedy only has story merit when it accompanies Drama.  Drama requires tension.  Tension is only possible when goals are in opposition.  Someone must be advocating for the character's goals.  If everyone is against the character, there is no opposition, there is no Drama, there is no story.  That's the whole purpose of the Heart vs. Mistaken split.  Authors can get away with this because they can pretend that the character is advocating for themself even though they the writier are guarenteeing failure.  But to do this in an RPG is pointless and defeats the purpose of roleplaying in a group in the first place.  You'd be better served by just getting a pen and writing all the tragedy you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*It would be possible to reverse this so that someone else was advocating for your character.  In Polaris one would simply reverse which player was Heart and which Mistaken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318457/#Comment_318457" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T10:32:15+00:00" title="April  2, 2011 10:32AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't pull your punches, Ralph, say what you really feel!<br><br>I think for most of us there is a split personality thing going on.

I played Mountain Witch last week, for example, and because the GM doesn't know my dark fate (Fear comes true) at first it's up to me to provide the hooks whereby he can screw me (my young child stows away with us on our mission).

To this end, each one is said to have guidance over a specific set of story elements. Only the player with guidance over the proper character can make a statement in the story about that character, although other players are strongly encouraged to make suggestions. The different guides are:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Heart guides the protagonist himself, and can make definitive statements about his actions, their results, his health, emotions, and general status. The Heart\u2019s main responsibility in play is to react to the situations presented by the other players and play aggressively: making judgments, taking decisive action, and moving the story forward. The Heart is also responsible for maintenance of the Cosmos (see below). <b>When there is conflict, the Heart negotiates in favor of the protagonist.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mistaken guides the antagonists of the story, including all demons, and also guides the environment and background of the story. The Mistaken\u2019s main responsibility in play is to create conflict for the Heart to respond to \u2014 difficult situations, difficult battles, difficult choices. She plays the demons to the hilt, as vicious and nasty creatures, and at the same time makes sure that there is as much threat from those amongst the people that have turned against the knights. <b>Perhaps the most important demons that the Mistaken must guide are the dark temptations within the Knight\u2019s mind, which is why, in conflict, the Mistaken negotiates for the demons.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Full Moon guides the social and hierarchical realms of the story, including guiding all the secondary characters with<br/>\nwhom the protagonist has a primarily societal or hierarchical relationship, like fellow knights, artistic colleagues, commanding officers, senators, or emotionally distant family members. The Full Moon also guides minor male characters not present in the Cosmos. The Full Moon\u2019s main role in play is to introduce these characters, support their interests, and allow them to at times conflict with knight, at times aid him. In conflict, the Full Moon takes a referee role, making judgments about the fairness of the maneuvers between the Mistaken and the Heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe New Moon guides the personal and interpersonal realms of the story, including guiding all the secondary characters with whom the protagonist has a primarily emotional and personal relationship, like lovers, close friends, and some family members. The New Moon also guides minor female characters not present in the Cosmos. The New Moon\u2019s main role in play is to introduce these characters, support their interests, and allow them to at times ask too much of the knight, at times support him. In conflict, the New Moon works with the full moon in a referee role, making judgments about the fairness of the maneuvers between the Mistaken and the Heart.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318468/#Comment_318468" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T12:36:42+00:00" title="April  2, 2011 12:36PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you can't separate your desires from your character's desires, then rooting for their failure is counter-productive.<br><br>But if you can be of two minds about it, the dramatic irony can really make for good drama.<br><br>I do not believe that it is my responsibility to see that my character (in any game) always actively bends the situation to his or her best possible advantage.

For example we have a strong culture of deep character immersion that sometimes interrupt the gamier elements of storygames and the narrativist agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue here is that we really don't believe in the czege principle as an axiom of gaming. When I explain it to danes, many reply that they know their characters best and therefore are the best at getting them in trouble. We really love beating up our characters and wallow in their tragedy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also seen these things crop up in games of Shock, Poison'd and Fiasco, to name a few. The only storygame I've seen make it through repeatedly is PTA.

All you're saying is that you make decisions on behalf of a character seeking their goals, not that <i>you yourself</i> fight for those goals as an advocate fights for the goals of their client.  It sucks to hang on a clockface and everyone is laughing at you. An advocate for a character would certainly never permit such an outcome to occur, nor would they enjoy it if it did.  "Fuck!!!! My guy is hanging from a clockface! THIS IS AWFUL, I HATE THE GAME!"  <br><br>But you're right, a player who doesn't say "Well, yes, all right, my guy agrees to climb another floor and switch places with Bill there" based on his character's love for his Best Girl isn't going to create great situations.<br><br>"Advocacy" is the wrong word.

But actively pursuing that tragedy...abandoning your character and rooting for their failure is toxic.  Such play is not "playing" it is group mastabory emo-porn that could be better accomplished by writing short stories than through RPGs.<br/><br/>Tragedy only has story merit when it accompanies Drama.  Drama requires tension.  Tension is only possible when goals are in opposition.  Someone must be advocating for the character's goals.  If everyone is against the character, there is no opposition, there is no Drama, there is no story.  That's the whole purpose of the Heart vs. Mistaken split.  Authors can get away with this because they can pretend that the character is advocating for themself even though they the writier are guarenteeing failure.  But to do this in an RPG is pointless and defeats the purpose of roleplaying in a group in the first place.  You'd be better served by just getting a pen and writing all the tragedy you want.</blockquote>\nDoesn't a lot of this depend on your goals for playing?<br/><br/>For example, when I GM certain games, I don't advocate 100% for my NPCs. I will use them to oppose the player's characters but only to the extent that it supports the goal of the game. If it's pure competition, I will advocate the NPCs hard. If it's a thematic game, I'll advocate only as hard as I need to in service of that theme. If I'm running D&amp;D 4E or 3E as written, my goal in early encounters is to dwindle resources, not push so hard that it leads to a premature TPK. <br/><br/>That said, I do agree that if a conflict isn't a real conflict, it doesn't have tension for those directly involved. Although if my goal is to create tension in my audience, then this doesn't hold as much truth. You see this frequently in LARPs. Characters may be in conflict, but the goal isn't to create tension amongst the combatants but rather the audience who are also roleplaying in the game. <br/><br/>Even purely as a player, I will often make decisions that go against my character's interests. Instead of having a conflict, I will "say yes" to my opposition to put my character in a terrible situation. Often because I think it would be more fun for me to then advocate hard for my character from this new situation. In other words, I may hose my character in scene 1 so that I can fight hard for them in scene 2 from a position that is more interesting to me. If it\u2019s a game where players can scene frame, then I will scene frame myself into that position. But if I don't have that power, then I will let the opposition beat me early on so I can have a more dramatic time fighting them later. Common examples: letting the bad guy get away so we can have a more dramatic fight later or letting myself get captured so that I can later fight my way to freedom. In games like Call of Cthulhu, we constantly play against our character's interests to create a more entertaining time for the players. <br/><br/>One thing I love about many RPGs, they are flexible. I can be in a group with different ways of playing and still make it work. One person can be speaking in first person to another person speaking in third person\u2026 and the conversation works! Or one person can be advocating hard for their character while another person is using their character as a puppet to create new interesting situations. <br/><br/>Ultimately I think a lot of this depends on what your goals are. One person's broken will be another person's awesomess. Some old school D&amp;D players consider speaking in character to be toxic. Some LARPers consider rolling dice to be toxic. If your goal is to feel real tension, I agree that you likely need real conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318521/#Comment_318521" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T07:07:17+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  7:07AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2011 7:14AM by Valamir.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>For the record, I think Ralph is wrong as far as "player tension --&gt; narrative tension" being the only way to structure meaningful narrative, .</blockquote>\nYou don't think "Ralph is wrong"...because Ralph never said that.<br/><br/>The goals that "have to be in opposition" are not player goals, they're character goals.  The character has to want SOMETHING that it feels it should have.  WE as players might realize (and often do) that that something is going to cause more harm than good, but that is NOT the same as intentionally driving towards tragedy and wallowing in their misery.  The character believes that the goal it is seeking is good for it*.  They are not pursuing that goal wanting it to end in fiasco.  They are pursuing that goal believing it is in their best interests.  Since they cannot pursue it themselves, being of course fictional, we have to pursue it for them.  But we have to pursue it for them as they would pursue it...and they would not pursue it by actively seeking for it to end badly.  We, who are also audience, can often often see the bad end coming.  And we as players may choose not to avoid that bad end if we judge our characters as being unable to perceive it.  But we should not actively steer for a misery that our characters would have the awareness and will to avoid.<br/><br/>Its not about the player wanting to "win"; that's a red herring.  Its about playing your character as if your character wanted to win* (for whatever definition of success the character has in the given situation...success that we as players may well view as being pretty horrific).  And that means making decisions on the character's behalf that move that character closer to achieving their goals, just as they would make them if they could make them for themselves.  Intentionally sabotaging your own character because you think that would make the story more "interesting" is counter productive to producing interesting story in an RPG medium**<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RivoClavis</cite> For example we have a strong culture of deep character immersion that sometimes interrupt the gamier elements of storygames and the narrativist agenda.<br/><br/>The issue here is that we really don't believe in the czege principle as an axiom of gaming. When I explain it to danes, many reply that they know their characters best and therefore are the best at getting them in trouble. We really love beating up our characters and wallow in their tragedy.</blockquote>\nThis is a self contradictory statement.  It cannot be true that you both are immersed in your character AND intentionally getting them in trouble and beating them up.  Unless your character is Tyler Durden, he does not go around intentionally beating himself up.  Therefor, if you as a player ARE doing so...then by definition you are not immersed in that character, you are floating above him like an author chosing when to fuck with one of the characters you are writing.  If you are immersed in the character, acting as the character would, making decisions for the character that the character would make, then your choices may lead to tragedy...(and you may well LOVE it when they do) but you should not seek it out intentionally...because no character* would actually do so.***<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I agree with the content of this, but certainly not the word "advocacy" to describe it.</blockquote>  I don't know what else to call it.  The behavior I'm describing has always been called character advocacy in every conversation I've seen.  Probably too late to change the terminology.  Also, I'm not clear on the distinction between these two behaviors <blockquote> All you're saying is that you make decisions on behalf of a character seeking their goals, not that you yourself fight for those goals as an advocate fights for the goals of their client.</blockquote> that you're drawing here.<br/><br/><br/>* Exception:  If you're actually playing a highly self aware self destructive character who is seeking their own doom.<br/><br/>** There are some nuances around enforcing genre convention that are important to this broader issue that I'm leaving out here.<br/><br/>*** For clarity for those who've read other things of mine before:  no, I'm not advocating immersion here.  I often play "floating above the character".  But even so, you still must be making decisions for your character that your character would make.  If in fiction land your character is pausing, looking up at you and saying "wtf?  I'm gonna do what?"  then whatever drama you think you're creating is going to be hollow, artificial, forced, and not at all believable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318524/#Comment_318524" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T07:31:47+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  7:31AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, we're really into tragic, self-destructive stories.

If you are...great.  Fantastic.  More power to you.  For the record, I LOVE playing Polaris, and that's the only kind of story Polaris produces...I get it.  In fact, I have never played an RPG that does tragic self-destructive stories BETTER than Polaris.  <br><br>Thing is, ist is the Mistaken's job to bring that tragedy, not the Heart's.  Its the Mistaken's job to put the character in situations where the Heart player, advocating for their character, has no good options..no happy ending...no way to get off scott free.  And the rules of Polaris make that a certaintude.<br/><br/>When you play the Heart, there is no way you are going to manage to get a happy ending for your character.  There is no way your character is going to get out unscarred.  There is no way to avoid the tragedy...hell, the game's only two options are death (typically horrific) or betrayal.  But you have to TRY.  You have to play to the hilt your character's effort to save the world, get the girl, destroy the demons, and restore civilization...and, at least until you become "veteran", you have to play the character as believing they CAN actually achieve the happy ending. <br/><br/>Don't worry.  You won't get it.  You'll get all the tragedy you can handle.  And when you do "level up" to veteran, your character will start to become fully aware of their own impending doom and can be played accordingly.  If your Mistaken is doing their job, your character probably WILL wind up making things worse rather than better, "wrecking everthing around him in a downward spiral"...that's EXACTLY the stories you'll tell with Polaris.  But its the Mistaken's job to make that happen, NOT the Heart's.  So yes, if you are doing that to your own character as the Heart, you are playing WRONG.  Period, Paragraph, Fin.  As the Heart player you can (and should if you're going to enjoy the game) fully revel in and enjoy watching the excruciating hell the Mistaken is putting your character through.  But you CAN'T help them do it.  You have to fight them with every bit as much effort and skill as your character would be fighting them with.  <br/><br/><br/>And yes, IMO that is not only true of Polaris, which does a fantastic job of encoding that into the rules text, it is true of ALL roleplaying.  OTHER players are the sources of the antagonism that your character encounters..  That's not your job.  Your job is to play your character and negotiate those sources of antagonism as best you can.  This is entirely seperate from enjoying your own character's tragedy vs. wanting your character to win as a player.  They aren't even really related.   Your job as a player is to play your character's efforts to struggle against the antagonism...regardless of how much you the player are enjoying watching your character suffer.  It is other people at the table (GM, other players, in Polaris the "Mistaken") whose job it is to represent and hit you with that antagonism, not yours.<br/><br/>If you are providing the antagonism for your own character AND negotiating that antagonism on your character's behalf...then you are not roleplaying.  You are authoring fiction.  <br/><br/>I'll say that again:  If you are both the source of the antogonism facing your character, and your character's voice in dealing with that antagonism, then you are an author, writing your character's story, not a roleplayer playing your character..<br/><br/>Is that badwrongfun?  No.  Of course not.  Lots of people are authors and lots of people enjoy reading authored stories.  But trying to use an RPG as a writing tool for authors and then blaming the RPG for not fulfilling that role IS bad and wrong.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318528/#Comment_318528" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T08:44:10+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  8:44AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, I am completely aware of how Polaris is supposed to work, what the players are supposed to do and how that shapes the play.

I'm sure we can have the exact same amount of fun doing the same tragic story with both ways.

This is a great example. <br><br>In Ben's rules it is specified whose job it is to oppose/promote the character's agenda.

Let me try two examples from Polaris.  I'm a knight in a fight with a demon that has been set up as particularly tough.  Here are two statements I might make:  <br/><br/>1) "I lunge desperately to chop off his head, and my sword cleaves through his neck in one stroke."  <br/><br/>2) "I lunge desperately to chop off his head, and my sword shatters against his stone-hard flesh."  <br/><br/>I'd say that both of these are role-playing from the first part, but both of them are <i>not</i> role-playing in the second part.  In particular, both <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> involve equal role-playing.  Yet what we are discussing is that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> can be problematic for Polaris in particular.  I don't think that's true for all games, though.  <br/><br/>This isn't always the case, though.  For example, in Spirit of the Century, I've found that players are often really good at suggesting strong compels against their Aspects.  Players often have great ideas for what would be a good source of antagonism for their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318539/#Comment_318539" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T10:04:42+00:00" title="April  3, 2011 10:04AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2011 10:14AM by Matthijs.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always been an advocate of cross-cultural editing.

I attacked them like an anthropologist would an alien artifact. It was a great learning experience. Sometimes it was awesome, sometimes a trainwreck. We'd sit for hours before and after play, discussing how on earth we were <i>actually</i> supposed to play this or that game.

We find the reward of the game to come from vigorous creative agreement and seeing a collective effort succeed. More play, less game.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily &amp; Matthijs, you've dug nice and deep into what I've been trying to uncover from this. When I first discovered the story games way of playing, it was really hard to do cold. I bought Shock online, having never tried this strange form of gaming. It wasn't until I had read a dozen different games, read and listened to actual play, that I understood the mindset that lies beneath. I now consider myself fairly good at storygaming, but it is a continual effort to explain how my friends need to approach the games. It can for example be really hard for them to accept how the rules system contribute to generating the story and not just getting in the way of telling it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for narrative control, as I can see Matthijs also has experienced. I'll be running Fiasco at this year's Fastaval and my biggest concern is how to get the point across with regards to sharply dividing between establishing and resolving the scenes. When I try it, both often end up being decided by group consensus. The game loses some of it's edge that way, in my opinion, but it is still playable and creates the right kind of story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318546/#Comment_318546" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T10:48:34+00:00" title="April  3, 2011 10:48AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The games of Fiasco I played involved a fair amount of vigorous agreement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318551/#Comment_318551" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T11:35:13+00:00" title="April  3, 2011 11:35AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering whether Accomplishments, the final stage of character creation in Dogs in the Vineyard, brings more in this into focus. )Generally speaking, I'm in the "Story Games assume this advocacy, but that's culturally conditioned" camp.)<br><br>Dogs gives players options for failure--you can tactically decide to take the blow, or you can give whenever you want--but those options (usually) ramp up your effectiveness in later conflicts. In other words you can fail any time you like, but the system pushes you to advocate for your character.<br><br>However, the Accomplishment stage of character creation attacks the problem of advocacy for or advocacy against directly. Vincent proposes two ways of doing things (we're on p. 16 of my edition):<br/><br/>1. When your accomplishement is "straightforward" the player plays his/her character and the GM takes the character's opposition.<br/><br/>2. However, if "your accomplishment for your character is growth, learning, or a change of habits, then we play a little trick: you take the part of your character AS HE OR SHE IS, and I take the part of whatever forces or pressures are on your character to change."<br/><br/>For someone who has played primarily North American games, this is a bit of a mind fuck, but it straightforwardly shows two things: 1) That the game is set up so that dice play is for the character's advantage; and 2) you can play against your character's advantage, but only if the incentives of the dice system are switched around. Note that your character's better nature can win at any time--you just have to let it.<br/><br/>As an example, I think it demonstrates both the possibility of playing against your character and the difficulty that the systems of most Storygames pose to that problem.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318553/#Comment_318553" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T11:43:11+00:00" title="April  3, 2011 11:43AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2011 11:58AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco is a good example here, maybe, since it's more in the "freeform"/vigorous agreement camp than a "conflict-based Forge game".<br/><br/>Because in more "freeform" play, conflicts are essentially resolved through some kind of fiat or consensus, right? I think that's why we have:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>When asked for good playing tips at a Jeepform panel, Frederik Berg \xd8stergaard answered: "Lose more". That works very well in some games.</blockquote>\nIf you're playing in a fairly "freeform" situation, someone has to decide to "lose" when a conflict in the story comes up. If you and I are fighting, one of us *has* to, sooner or later, say, "OK, I'm defeated, you win." (Or else the entire group has to somehow make that happen, but one of us still has to accept that outcome to keep playing.) So, agreeing to "lose" is an important part of freeform play, or it grinds down into... I-don't-know-what.<br/><br/>As far as I can see, this is kind of like 'resolving a scene' in Fiasco: most likely, it was 'established' by other players, maybe just your opponent, maybe the whole group working together.<br/><br/>Can we use some examples from play to describe what we're talking about? That might help us get on the same page, whether they're real examples or made-up ones.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>One player: "The stone monster lunges at Sir Gabriel!"<br/>A second player: "Sir Gabriel ducks to the side and swings his sword at the stone monster, but it bounces off the monster's skin, shattering to pieces! Sir Gabriel falls to the ground, weeping with shame."<br/>The first player: "Haha! The monster towers over Sir Gabriel, lifting its stone fists high above the knight's head, ready to crush him to death."<br/>The second player: "Sir Gabriel cowers in fear, prepared to die, as a lone tear for all those he has failed rolls down his cheek."<br/><br/>What's going on here? Where do we go next? If I was at that table, I would be confused about what to do next, unless Sir Gabriel's death seemed like a great way to finish the scene: but even then, who should be the one to decide that now is the time? It seems like both player one and player two are hesitant to do so.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe the second player has more to add: "... but, at the very last moment, he rolls out of the way and flees toward the forest." This would be something like what John (jenskot) is describing: it's a middle ground where player two is advocating for his character, sure... he just wants to see him get into <i>a little more</i> trouble first, to escalate the drama, or to help the other player establish the fearsome nature of his opposition.<br/><br/>Can this example be a functional form of roleplaying, if player two is playing Sir Gabriel? What would it look like in your group? <br/><br/>Now, what if player <i>one</i> is playing Sir Gabriel? Would this ever happen? What would it look like?<br/><br/><br/>[Edit: Dogs accomplishments! A great example, too. I hope we can chat about that one. I've never seen a successful "reverse accomplishment" scene.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318560/#Comment_318560" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T12:05:50+00:00" title="April  3, 2011 12:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2011 12:08PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Also, I'm not clear on the distinction between these two behaviorsAll you're saying is that you make decisions on behalf of a character seeking their goals, not that you yourself fight for those goals as an advocate fights for the goals of their client.</blockquote>that you're drawing here.<br/><br/>I understand, many jargon ships have sailed, leaving us with non-narrative Narrativism, non-simulation Simulationism, non-impossible non-things not-before-breakfast Impossible Things Before Breakfast and now I suppose we are stuck with non-advocacy Advocacy. Sigh. <br/><br/>Anyway, to the distinction!<br/><br/>An advocate is someone who looks at a situation, looks at your goals, and does their best to guide you to those goals using <i>their</i> wisdom, thinking, experience, and knowledge.  "You shouldn't climb the outside wall," the advocate says sagely, putting a hand on The Boy's shoulder.  "That will get you in trouble with the police and your best girl is so in love with you that she'll understand that you just need a little more time. She's waited this long, right? Right. Now here's what you're going to do to get that money so you can send for your best girl and you won't end up dangling from a clockface in a dangerous position. First you're going to go apologize to the police officer and say it was all a big misunderstanding..."<br/><br/>Whereas someone who is <i>roleplaying</i> says "Oh man, I've just GOT to get that prize money! I start climbing!"  The roleplaying person creates the hilarious situation and great story, the advocate inerringly guides the character away from their own mistaken passions.<br/><br/>To say a player advocates for a character is to say the player guides the character towards the character's goals with the <i>player's</i> knowledge and drives and thinking. You don't hire a lawyer because the lawyer goes off half-cocked and screams at your neighbor to stop throwing garbage over the wall, that's something <i>you do yourself</i>.  You hire a lawyer to advocate for you exactly because the lawyer will NOT do that in pursuing your goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318585/#Comment_318585" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T14:18:02+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  2:18PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you're right, that term sux.<br/><br/>What do you use?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318587/#Comment_318587" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T14:40:26+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  2:40PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm confused by a number of things in this thread, but the most obvious one is why its not obvious to others that the issue is actually not one of advocating for your character, its actually caring about how your character ends up enough for conflict to be <em>possible.</em> It seems to me that in Per's Polaris game the Mistaken was missing a vital opportunity to fulfill their game role by <em>not</em> figuring out how to inhibit the Heart player's designs on <em>how</em> the character should be coming to a bloody, horrible end. If the Heart <em>only</em> wants to see the character burn and doesn't much care how it happens -- well, in terms of simple story narrative, they've got some crappy stories.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Danes just have a cultural affinity for crappy stories, but I don't think literary history really bears that out.</p>\n<p>The Mistaken player has to observe what's going on and then consciously go for the antagonism, or the Heart won't care and you get bland, limp stories. If they can't do that, or <em>won't</em> do it, you get bland, limp stories. If its all collaborative hand-holding on the Road to Doom ... why bother playing Polaris, which is all about jumping right into someone's way with both arms outstretched and saying, "OK, fight for it!", whatever <em>it</em> is? Write a freakin' story together. You don't have conflicts to resolve, why are you even playing a game?</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, it was Capes that put its finger right on making that aspect of narrative GM-less gaming clearest to me. You <em>have</em> to create Conflicts people will care about. Anything they care about. If you don't play dangerous, there's no story, no one cares. And <em>whatever</em> someone cares about, that's what you go after with violence aforethought. You have to target what they care about, or there's no story. In Capes, its very clear when you're succeeding and when you're failing with that and the mechanics make it explicit; good play and good Conflicts gets you more tokens to build more story with. Polaris goes off in a similar direction with less immediate feedback available on a per-scene basis for knowing how well you're doing; its more an issue encoded in the roles than the process. That's what the Mistaken's there to do, to antagonize in the purest sense.</p>\n<p>In closing, I'd like to reply to Matthijs when he says:</p>\n<p>"One thing I remember we really struggled with was the idea of wrestling for narrative control - like in Universalis. The basic assumption that we'd disagree on where the story should go, and that this would be a driving force for the game's mechanisms, didn't fit our group."</p>\n<p>Why were you playing a game, then? Seriously, that's not a rhetorical question. What was the point in having a set of rules to mediate conflicts if you don't have conflicts at the level of the rules? That's not useful and its not fruitful. That's not to say you shouldn't be playing together, just that you shouldn't be playing games together. Vaguely as if you said you played Monopoly, but run it as a communal pool of money and the die rolls were just suggestions. It goes well beyond "What's the point?" and over into "Aren't there more rewarding contexts for your time?"</p>\n<p>Sometimes I think people really just don't want to play games, they want a communal social context and they're terribly confused and think they need rules for it as an excuse. This is one of those times.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318588/#Comment_318588" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T14:42:59+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  2:42PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like I say, I just use "roleplaying".<br/><br/>Anyway, to the topic of the thread, I think there's probably not as huge a distinction as people are making it out to be here. To use Paul T.'s freeform example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>One player: "The stone monster lunges at Sir Gabriel!"<br/>A second player: "Sir Gabriel ducks to the side and swings his sword at the stone monster, but it bounces off the monster's skin, shattering to pieces! Sir Gabriel falls to the ground, weeping with shame."<br/>The first player: "Haha! The monster towers over Sir Gabriel, lifting its stone fists high above the knight's head, ready to crush him to death."<br/>The second player: "Sir Gabriel cowers in fear, prepared to die, as a lone tear for all those he has failed rolls down his cheek."</blockquote>\nI think the "prepared to die" here is the centerpiece of the scene - it reflects something in the knight's character/passions, the action (cowering, etc.) is based on the desires and priorities of the knight. Saying "he's prepared to die" is a strong statement right in the wheelhouse of what I think Valamir is saying about connecting character action to character needs/goals.  <br/><br/>Certainly there's a difference (and maybe we can talk about <i>which</i> character passions/goals/beliefs/etc create stories to our taste), but it is a very fine one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318589/#Comment_318589" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T14:47:08+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  2:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2011 2:58PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>In closing, I'd like to reply to Matthijs when he says:"One thing I remember we really struggled with was the idea of wrestling for narrative control - like in Universalis.

No reason Universalis should be any different.</blockquote>\nExcept that's exactly what he's saying. Especially in the context of Universalis, all those conflicts are explicitly about "where the story is going." Hell, I think its fair to say that every part of the narrative is about where the story goes at some level. The very definition of conflict. In the context of D&amp;D, whether your character is flat on his back in the dust or on his feet doing At Wills is explicitly and entirely about how the story will go and at least one person at the table is invested in a different outcome than another. <br/><br/>I've only played one game-system where there could reasonably be said that the players are all in one-mind on the direction and no conflict exists between them on the levels we've been speaking of, the Two-Hour Wargames <b>All Things Zombie</b>, <b>Warrior Heroes</b> and such, and that purely and only because the mechanics themselves driven by randomizers act as the "opposition" in play and same-side groups run with -- in theory -- the same narrative ends in mind. And even then, out of all the games I've ever run of ATZ, I think there's only been one case where no one started shooting at someone else to leave them as zombie bait. Needless to say, they had narrative differences which the mechanics helped resolve.<br/><br/>Even in the above, antagonism is being provided from an external source to the individual player, its just mechanized. The player has explicitly committed to caring about something by committing to play the game rules and they are opposed. Per's been talking about not even having an external source of conflict because everyone's in agreement and Matthjis stated outright that the idea that the players should disagree on where the story goes as being a driving force for play didn't work for his group. All I'm saying is that if you don't have any differences in desires imposed from without on how the story should go, you're not playing a game or shouldn't be playing a game. Period. There's no need to pretend, no need to whitewash it, if you don't want to have some conflict between players about ends ... you're probably not playing a game. If you have no common buy-in about where you want things to go and have taken on board an externally sourced conflict, you're not playing a game and shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Writing a story together is not a game. It can be fun, and it might be exciting, and it might be about conflicts, but its not a game. Story Gaming implicitly suggests you've bought in on the process of playing a game and the "mechanics matter" crowd makes it explicit that there will be conflicts between player directions and it systematically exists to resolve them in them in interesting ways.<br/><br/>So, to bring it around to the original question: No, Per, Polaris isn't broken. Your understanding of it seems to have been and your play certainly might be, but the systems in Polaris which demand your players (Mistaken) figure out what the Hearts want and oppose it isn't. That's the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318594/#Comment_318594" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T15:31:50+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  3:31PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2011 3:32PM by Per_Fischer.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite><br/><br/>So, to bring it around to the original question: No, Per, Polaris isn't broken.

But that seems to stretch the definition past the point. Indeed, while the player wants his character's sword to hit, and may be let down a bit when it doesn't, failing that roll in no way takes the story in a direction they don't want to go.  They're okay with missing a swing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318600">\n<div

I wanted to play Uni because I was curious and thought it might be fun, or point me towards fun. <br/><br/>I made Archipelago later.

I would tend to say the category is "Play", but whatever.<br/><br/>I've noticed that a couple of other languages tend to use a single word for all of those concepts wrapped up together and the word tends to mean something like "Play", but then can be modified by another word or word chunk to give a more precise meaning.<br/><br/>Now me, i'm a dirty-hippie. I can live with "Game" including the more simple basic concept of "structured play with challenge". It's how I can manage to say something like "Hey, let's go play a game of hackie sack" and mean something like "hey let's bounce that little beanbag around with our feet and try to keep it from falling to the ground as much as possible."<br/><br/>Frankly, the stuff some folks seem to be writing off as not a game, or not a roleplaying game, inovles a fuck ton of challenge and structure, and even win conditions, including the stuff that seems to be being beaten up as involving vigorous agreement. <br/><br/>The win conditions are largely in the social recognition category ( Dude! That was awesome when thing x happened! I totally didn't see that coming but it was so dead-perfect! We should get together and play another game soon!).<br/><br/>And challenge? Have you ever tried to get vigorous agreement amongst a bunch of creative opinionated people?!?<br/><br/>But ya know what does bug me? Seeing an attitude like "Go write fan fiction together, ya yahoos! That ain't a game!"<br/><br/>Really? Here at Story-Games? Man, i see enough of that back-handed nonsense when I try to discuss some really great story-game or experimental game (like Universalis, which I still think is maybe one of my favorite dirty-hippy games ever) at places like RPGnet. Is it really necessary to engage in that here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318727/#Comment_318727" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T14:04:37+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  2:04PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I just read this entire thread and I'm sorta confused here. There seems to be a bloc that says it's difficult for them to play Polaris because they are arguing for character failure as much as character success? That seems like totally legit Polaris behavior to me\u2014if you're the Mistaken. I tend to see the currently active knight as "belonging" to all four players at the Polaris table; you just organize your role and the nature of your advocacy based on what you happen to be playing right now. So you do get to advocate for your character's failure; you also get to advocate for your character's success, though, and some weird things besides, and that rotation makes whichever role is your favorite\u2014maybe it's advocating for failure, here\u2014more meaningful and fun by way of comparison.

We all like playing characters who lose. We all like roleplaying our characters as if they are pursuing what they think are their best interests.<br/><br/>Is it this:<br/><br/>Fiasco &amp; Archipelago:  as a roleplayer you try to win, and as a narrator, it's undefined - the rules allow you to happily escort your character to a train wreck (and give yourself loot, within some limits...)<br/><br/>Polaris: as a roleplayer you try to win, and as a narrator (when you're Heart) you try to win, counting on the antagonist and the rules to deliver you tragedy.<br/><br/>D&amp;D: as a roleplayer you try to win, and you're not allowed to narrate, because you'd award yourself fat loot.<br/><br/>Is Polaris "American" and Fiasco/Archipelago "Danish"? Is that the divide - whether you can and should use your narrative authority to benefit your character?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318766/#Comment_318766" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T17:30:20+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  5:30PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The interesting part of this discussion for me is:<br/><br/>Will certain games "break" (i.e. not function correctly) if the players do not push for their characters' success, as advocates?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318774/#Comment_318774" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T18:54:37+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  6:54PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think most RPGs and RP-activities break under those circumstances, Paul.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_318786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318786/#Comment_318786" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T22:23:17+00:00" title="April  4, 2011 10:23PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2011 10:31PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>Oliver thinks that the American way is to root for your character to succeed and overcome obstacles, while the Danish (Nordic?) way is just as much to root for your character to fail and get knocked down, if it makes for a more interesting story.</blockquote>I believe Oliver is wrong. Both ways of doing this is present in good measure within both American and Nordic games.<br/><br/>There's been so much cross-inspiring discussion and gaming, and indeed co-design, the last years, that I feel any split in methodic choices, based on local design-culture, is fading. The field is levelling out, and broadening, and role-playing-design is going in many directions all at once, with less regard to the geographical origin of the maker. But of course; that is me talking from Norway.<br/><br/>On Polaris; if the game is meant to be played with the player supporting his character, as most classical games do, then it is only broken if you get a bad game by choosing this stance.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Will certain games "break" (i.e. not function correctly) if the players do not push for their characters' success, as advocates?</blockquote>Yes, most games will, as most games still makes this a premise for play. Players pushing for their characters success is a very effective methodic premise, as most "free wills" (our characters in most games) will try their best to survive and succeed. <i>We the players</i> act as the free will of our characters, and make the choices, and therefore <i>we the players</i> will feel the consequences with acuity too. As long as we seek to make believable characterizations, or to immerse in our characters, this will be an effective premise for a role-playing game. It is not the only premise we have, but I believe it will stay the most interesting and significant one.<br/><br/>As for players experimenting with other stances for their characters, driving them into misery and ruin, and then claiming the game is broken if their interaction becomes lame ...<br/>- well, as long as the game is not built to support this kind of player behavior, then the <i>player</i> has broken faith with his game, and need to find another one to fulfill his wishes. The time when we expected any game to support any way of gaming, is well and truly behind us. I believe someone said "system matters" someway back in the old days, and from then on it did. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318791/#Comment_318791" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T23:02:27+00:00" title="April  4, 2011 11:02PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Will certain games "break" (i.e. not function correctly) if the players do not push for their characters' success, as advocates?</blockquote>Yes, most games will, as most games still makes this a premise for play.
