Each character would basically be a collection of traits that all used the same rules and could be used in more or less the same circumstances.  Honestly, in my mind, what vanilla Fudge lacks is a sense of "aboutness" to drive storytelling and character issues.  Like, if you took vanilla Fudge and slapped on the Trust mechanics from <i>The Mountain Witch</i> or the Humanity mechanics from <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Vampire</i>, all of a sudden you're cooking with gas.  The escalation rules from <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> would work the same way.  Basically, what vanilla Fudge lacks is a mechanic to point play in a specific direction.  Lacking that, the group has to find one on its own, which works for some groups and playstyles but isn't really what I'm looking for in my play, really.  I like more focus and guidance than that.  It would be cool, though, to have a bunch of Fudge-style plug-and-play mechanics like that which would work to create a sense of aboutness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181028/#Comment_181028" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T11:16:56+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 11:16AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you mistake me.

Whoa whoa! That's a great idea!<br/>That's pretty much what Fate was conceived to do, on our end.  There's a reason the Fate 2.0 PDF has a bunch of different magic systems in it, modular choose-your-grain skill-list building, and a whole lot of various other examples &amp; whatnot. (<a href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/FATE2fe.pdf" rel="nofollow">See the Fate 2.0 PDF here</a>)<br/><br/>Fudge is lacking in a lot of "prebuilt" stuff (several tools, no modules).  It also was in many ways -- for us -- relentlessly, um, "story agnostic" (for lack of a better way of putting it).  Aspects arose as an attempt to "fix" that particular problem for our play, and I think the resulting division of the community into Fate-yes and Fate-no pieces arose partly because that's how folks fell on the whole "should the system be able to directly address the story?" spectrum. At a guess.<br/><br/>Anyway. Someone asked me to come along and say somethin'.

It's a toolkit, and it's also not a toolkit -- it just depends on how much you want.  "Plain" Fudge is quite usable as an "old-school" rules-light RPG.  Heck, it's a lot more complete than the old version of The Window, and a good number of people ran games with that.<br/><br/>On the toolkit side, it's also a very adaptable core system, as long as you don't want fine granularity.  There was a push at one point to collect a bunch of Fudge extensions in a sort of "plug and play" fashion -- I'm not sure whatever happened with that, since that was around the time I drifted out of having much of anything to do with Fudge.<br/><br/>I do remember a long Usenet argument (or series of arguments) about whether Fudge was a playable game "as-is" or not.  Personally, I consider it to be playable as-is, simply taking it as an Over the Edge style game, with traits instead of a fixed attribute list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181115/#Comment_181115" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T20:52:29+00:00" title="December  1, 2008  8:52PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>As one of the people who helped create Fudge, you guys are making me feel old.</blockquote>\nAwesome.  Yeah, it's almost 10 years to the day that my best friend, who at the time worked at Steffan O'Sullivan's coworker/boss-like creature over at a consulting firm, hooked me up with a copy of the original Fudge RPG (it was a gift in exchange for helping him move one weekend). Steffan's an awesome, laid-back dude as well. Seeing him speak at some consulting events, you really get an idea of how much games permeate his existence (the consulting company basically ran a simulation game for executives). <br/><br/>But yeah, that was back in like 1998.

What sucks about it? Let's hear both sides of the stories of Fudge!<br/><br/>As for my experience with vanilla Fudge: My biggest experience with it was that aforementioned Delta Green campaign. We played 3 scenarios straight out of the book. It was totally servicable for us: It totally worked without getting bogged down, and at the same time it wasn't any more explosively awesome than the original BRP rules. I preferred our hack over BRP in the long run, but it wasn't like revolutionary or anything, overall a good time.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181130/#Comment_181130" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T23:10:16+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 11:10PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2008 12:05AM by Johnstone.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, lessee... We got X points to put in stats, Y points to put in skills, with no pre-set lists. And we ended up playing Call of Cthulhu basically, complete with dumping points into skills (and stats) that never get used. Taking Flaws got us extra points, but Gifts and Flaws are pure roleplaying, no mechanical effect.<br/><br/>Dice are for task resolution. Rolls don't always do something, especially Perception tests. Full disclosure: I hate Fudge dice, because I always feel like I'm losing ground when they roll bad, and they seem to roll bad more often than they roll good. Now, I could handle that if there was a resource to mitigate bad rolls, like Aspects and Fate points. But I ran a short game of Spirit of the Century for this group, and that's where the idea to use Fudge came from. I realized SotC isn't really the game for me to run (just personal preference - I'm still interested in other versions of Fate), but here's the rub - I realized I really, really like Aspects, but don't like Fudge dice - they didn't really get Aspects and decided to go with the Fudge dice. Haha, shoot me.<br/><br/>The GM wants a low-complexity rules set so there's some game, but not enough to really get in the way of the story. One of the players is really Simulationist, in the way that he thinks about how stuff would work in real life, and wanted to count ammo even when the GM doesn't care. All I want is rules that give me some choices and some power to shape the story mechanically. Fudge doesn't support any of us, except that it doesn't really get in the way very much, and partly that's because there isn't much in the way of rules to argue about. I'm in the game for the people, I like the group, in spite of the rules. Maybe sometime I can run Lacuna for them.<br/><br/>There you go, man! Here's my advice - if you play with Fudge, find some of those modules and attachments etc and tailor it for your game. Looking at the printed-out rulebook, it's a massive wad of papers, but all we use is experience points and raising stats and skills. There must be something in there that makes a game good!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181252/#Comment_181252" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T16:34:09+00:00" title="December  2, 2008  4:34PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My biggest issue with Fudge was that skills and attributes were unrelated to each other and that attributes seemed to be there only because other games used them.  Story element combat rolls blew me away (in combination with scene-based resolution from "Story Engine" at the time) and I really started to dig that level of resolution.<br/><br/>I chose at some point to run Fudge using Over The Edge style traits that has certain levels assigned to them (almost like PDQ, now that I think of it)  I also required a "shot pool" for special effects.  Sadly, I only ran this build for a con game once.  But I liked it.  Enter FATE, many years later.<br/><br/>When I found FATE, it was love.  It had the skills/attributes placed into a loving pile together and Aspects rocked.  Best of all, it had a much more clear scene resolution mechanic that was something like story elements combat meets Tunnels &amp; Troll rounds.  My biggest complaint about SotC and Dresden continues to be the lack of real support for scene-based resolution - easily fixed, but requires some tweaks like mad to stunts and such to make them re-balance...<br/><br/>After my big, long Fate game <a href="http://juddgoswick.com/NeverHome/NeverHomeMain.htm" rel="nofollow">(found here)</a> was done, I found TSOY and PDQ, and the hits keep coming.<br/><br/>So Fudge got me going in the right direction, but it was more of a herald for what I was looking for and less of a watershed game for me.  That being said, I am sure I owe much of what I like in games now to what the people who worked on Fudge did then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181370/#Comment_181370" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T13:24:24+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  1:24PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2008 1:27PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fudge was an eye-opening game for me in a whole number of ways that no longer seem revolutionary, but were at the time it was written.<br/><br/>For instance, take the concept that players can name their own skills and Gifts/Faults, or that characters can be designed "subjectively" (i.e. choose whatever feels right instead of number-crunching). Take the idea that each game or each game setting can (or should!) have a different set of attributes. Or take the idea that what a group needs is a flexible and consistent mechanic that can be used on the spot to create rulings as opposed to a set of rules that tries to determine all the factors beforehand. <br/><br/>That famous "attributes aren't linked to skills" business? The Fudge answer, "just set your skills at the level you think suit your character best", is a really, really fresh breath of air, compared to most of the popular RPGs of the time. What's on the sheet is what you are--none of that funky derived scores business where you have to buy up one thing if you want to have a good chance at some other thing.<br/><br/>However, the main thing about Fudge that I find incredibly useful is the way the dice and the adjectives work together. Not only is it one of the easiest mechanics to flex and modify, but the adjective ladder is absolutely incredible when it comes to pickup games, con games, or gaming with newbies/non-gamers.<br/><br/>When I first read the rules, I couldn't see what the benefit of using words over numbers was. After playing the game many, many times, with many different people, it's wonderfully clear. One side of it is simply accessibility. Try this: create some pregenerated characters for a con game or one-shot and hand them out to the players. In most systems, they'll be seeing a bunch of numbers, weird jargon, etc, all of which doesn't give the players any kind of clue as to what kind of character they're playing and what their abilities are like in the context of the game. In Fudge, EVERYONE can just read the character sheet and immediately understand what their character is and what their capabilities are. Because instead of "ThAC0 17, AC 5", or "I shot my father 2d10", you have "Great Swordsman, Poor Health". No one needs to explain that one to you. It's descriptive in a way everyone can grasp instantly.<br/><br/>The other wonderful thing is how the adjective ladder makes it incredibly easy for the GM (and everyone else) to create ratings for stuff on the fly. Again, compare: you're running this game, and someone wants to impress the Queen with a painting. In most game systems, you might be thinking, "is that 4 successes or 5 successes?" Or, maybe, "Well, it's more than an average task at DC 20, but probably not a DC 30, because that's what it takes to avoid a death trap..."<br/><br/>That's a hard call to make unless you're really, really familiar with the game and have played it for a long time. However, in Fudge, you can just ask, "Would a Good painting be enough to impress her, or would it have to be a Superb painting?" That's an easy call to make, even for a new GM, even for someone who's never played an RPG before. And the seven levels are about perfect for this kind of decision--it is just incredibly intuitive. <br/><br/>Is Fudge a complete game? Compared to most RPGs of its time, it definitely is (unless you're unwilling to make a few decisions before playing). Compared to the games coming out now--you know, the ones this forum is about--no: it doesn't tell why to play or what to play about. By those standards, it's just a toolkit with no instructions on how to use it. But the mechanics are wonderful, especially for new roleplayers or pickup games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
