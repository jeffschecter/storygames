And yes, the name is still subject to change--any comments on that would be appreciated ^^<br/><br/>The main thing I'd like is feedback on the mechanics themselves. A lot of things have changed since the previous version. There's a lot more the system can "do," while other things are made simpler to use.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are things I've forgotten to add in, but I think the rules are 90% complete for this draft.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uri3YYjsglCKkeGJDuU3mGTjV3LO93GU7c1ujZi7yYk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">READ HERE</a><br/><br/>Note that if you have a comment about a particular piece of text, you can highlight the text and add the comment in Google Docs. And if there's a typo or something, you can tweak the spelling and I'll see it as a suggestion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
