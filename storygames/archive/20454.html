Essentially the players would be hunters in this Gothic Western Post-Apoc Future. I'm looking for a system that can hold larger than life characters, quick narrative battles, horror, and of course - monster hunting. I'm not necessarily a fan of generic systems - FATE, Savage Worlds. Is there a story game that could thematically or mechanically carry VHD universe?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449786/#Comment_449786" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-28T05:02:09+00:00" title="November 28, 2015  5:02AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The standard answers are things like <i>Heroquest</i>, <i>Solar System</i>, <i>Apocalypse World</i>, even <i>Burning Wheel</i> - flexible more or less universal systems with strong dramatic and narrative focus. If you feel that FATE is too non-thematic (and adventure-focused, perhaps?), maybe one of those four would work for you. They all require you to do a bit of pre-campaign lego building to set up the mechanical basics of how vampires work and whatnot.<br/><br/>Or, if you don't want to adapt the setting to a rules system, but rather want an out of the box solution, how about <i>Dread: the First Book of Pandemonium</i>? It's an excellent game with a monster-hunting focus in a challenging, dramatic context. (It's also more naturally a gamist than a narrativist or simulationist game, for those who care about GNS.) About 85% compatible with your inspiration, I'd say, so you could either play it as is for a quick fix, or do a bit of adaptation to make it more vampire hunterly and less demon hunterly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449787/#Comment_449787" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-28T10:18:38+00:00" title="November 28, 2015 10:18AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell us more about what <i>you</i> want out of your game.

Within those constraints, which games do you personally like or dislike, in general, and why?</blockquote>\nGreat questions. <br/><br/>1. Themeatically I feel VHD is rather formulaic: Track down monsters, slaughtering mooks along the way, followed by a big gothic showdown at the end. All of this is wrapped in this setting that is larger than life, with larger than life characters. So if I had to break what would be important in a system, I'd break it up into those 4 things. <br/>a. Tracking a big monster<br/>b. Cutting through lesser bad guys with ease<br/>c. Facing unspeakable horror at the end<br/>d. All of this wrapped in these larger than life characters. <br/><br/>2. What logistical concerns do I have. <br/>a: My players know very little about VHD. Hence I'm not a fan of generic systems. It's just too hard to get everyone on the same page. FATE in particular has never been able to really get off the ground.  Likewise it can create decision paralysis when it comes to aspects. <br/>b. I will be GMing up to 7 players. So I'd like a system where lesser-important combat can be done quickly. Maybe within a roll or two. When you look at anime, battles are very polarized. They are either single strike events, or long drawn out affairs. A big battle at the end is fine (and if it's scary, even encouraged), but we need to actually be able to get to that moment instead of bogged down in-mid game minutiae. <br/>c: I need something where monster creation is easy.<br/>d. Equipment doesn't matter. <br/><br/>Other tidbits: <br/>-I'm a fan of Apocalypse World, I like the playbooks because it really gives the players good deal of direction when it comes to characters. It helps steer them into a setting. <br/>-I like minimal GM die rolling. Players enjoy rolling the die themselves. They don't enjoy the GM rolling as much. <br/>-I'm a fan of Shonen Final Burst. I like the idea of integrating playing cards into games. <br/>-My PC's aren't fans of long drawn out character creation. <br/><br/>Hopefully this helps...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449794/#Comment_449794" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-28T23:47:21+00:00" title="November 28, 2015 11:47PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the main focus of the game the various set-piece fights, in that case?

I want the players to feel that each session or two could've been a complete episode/book/movie. My players have been very much used to long-winded decompressed epics. I think the consesus is they'd like a game where they feel like over the course of a single session (or two) that they've accomplished things. They've seen interesting things, done interesing things, and can move on to the next challenge. <br/><br/>2. To me, I'm excited just because it's a big expansive setting. There is a lot to pluck from already sourced material and a lot of room to invent more. The formula really keeps us from losing thematic focus. It just makes everything a bit tighter. <br/><br/>3: As far as these "big" characters are concerned - manga/anime fiction isn't exactly known for it's subtlely. The characters are really much defined by what they do, they are high concept, and very much archetypical. The physically weak but mentally strong psychic, lovable bionic brute, the emotionally distant but impeccably skilled sniper. And in the D universe those characters shift from competent to puddy in the face of insurmountable evil. <br/><br/>4. My players got excited about the VHD univere really on a whim. They've wanted to play a horror game for sometime now, a classic monster hunting game.  Some people wanted historical, others wanted something in the future. There was a lot of interest in playing a Castlevania game. I told them that VHD is kind of the blender of all those concepts. A couple of players are farmiliar with the Vampire Hunter D movies too. I think the ones who aren't familiar are really holding onto this idea of a western, post apocalyptic, gothic setting. A lot of the interest being pointed at that classically gothic horror (vampires, castles, hammer horror bits).<br/><br/>Are we moving into a clearer direction now? <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449797/#Comment_449797" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-29T02:14:02+00:00" title="November 29, 2015  2:14AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you don't want a generic game, and there isn't an existing Vampire Hunter D game, you're gonna have to make one.<br/><br/>I would suggest looking to OVA or Fantaji if Fate Core is not quite your thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449802/#Comment_449802" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-29T09:16:55+00:00" title="November 29, 2015  9:16AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you don't want a generic game, and there isn't an existing Vampire Hunter D game, you're gonna have to make one.</blockquote>\n\u2026Or hack some pieces together from existing games!<br/><br/>You could look into Pelgrane's <i>Gumshoe</i> family of game for something which really emphasizes the monster-hunting\u2026<br/><br/>Or you could have a look at Mike Sands' AW-based <i>Monster of the Week</i> for a game which follows your "formula" very closely.<br/><br/><b>But</b> of course MotW doesn't have gonzo over-the-top superpowered characters as the baseline, so you might want to <i>write your own playbooks</i>. Which shouldn't be that hard, since you can use the existing MotW playbooks as your template (they're pretty uncomplicated) and mine Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, etc. for specific moves that fit your vision.<br/><br/>Or you could start from the powerful anime character side of the equation and use Christian Griffen's <i>Anima Prime</i>, possibly with a couple adaptations:<br/>- downplay or outright jettison "story seeds" as a way of driving the story and replace those with your formula (not that story seeds aren't wonderful, but you already have a formula!). You can still reference MotW, as above, for how to implement the formula.<br/>- character creation might run a bit longer than your tastes with players who aren't already familiar with the rules (it does run a tad long for mine!). Fix that by making "playbooks": a bit of VHD flavor and a package of appropriate Powers, or a set of Powers to choose from. This should take you less than half the time (or less than a quarter) compared to designing AW-style playbooks.<br/>- don't get bogged down in mook fights as full-on battles. Either handwave them as "just a color scene", design mooks as merely a single swarm-type or squad-type opponent to have a short simple fight, or devise some kind of skill-check-like middle-ground.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449806/#Comment_449806" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-29T18:15:31+00:00" title="November 29, 2015  6:15PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How hard would it be to "reskin" Monster of the Week into "gonzo", without actually changing any (or many) of the rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449810/#Comment_449810" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-29T21:00:08+00:00" title="November 29, 2015  9:00PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd probably go with Savage Worlds myself or I might do it using one of my own games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish" title="CoveredInFish"><img alt="CoveredInFish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/940/nWJ86I3UKR7RA.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish">CoveredInFish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449811/#Comment_449811" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-29T21:48:39+00:00" title="November 29, 2015  9:48PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also thought of MotW. <br/><br/><br/>I feel like Tenra Bansho Zero really captures Anime Fight Scenes really well, also larger-than-life characters.
