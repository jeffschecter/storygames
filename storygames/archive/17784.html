Unity is a run-and-gun rpg about fragging the man in a near-future dystopia. It's sort of like <i>Rifts</i> filtered through <i>3:16</i> in the spirit of <i>Borderlands</i>. If you have feedback or questions, I'd love to hear from you.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402337/#Comment_402337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T08:10:32+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  8:10AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Clint, this looks totally awesome! I also grew up playing Rifts and I like what you're doing here.<br/><br/>A couple initial thoughts, when I think about running it (hopefully I'll get the chance to play it soon).<br/><br/>1. In the first book, I really love the Phases Map on page 9. That's super helpful as a way of explaining the structure of play.  However, it seems a bit odd that the next section is "Combat" and then the other phases aren't explained until the very end. I think it would be helpful to have at least an overview of all four phases as soon as they are first introduced. Is the GM supposed to start the first session with a fight? If not, it'd be cool if the structure of the book more closely matched the structure of play. For example, the GM/players first decide on a MISSION or goal, yeah? And then they might REDLINE to a place, then EXPLORE it, which probably results in COMBAT, and then they might have more exploration and DOWNTIME. Is that more or less what you have in mind?<br/><br/>2. From looking over it briefly, it seems as if the GM doesn't create their own antagonists, but simply uses resources to purchase enemies out of the book for the players to encounter, yeah? That's cool, but I worry that the limited number of antagonists included in the book means that you won't be able to play very long without things getting repetitive. Has that not been the case in playtesting? Do people fight Peacekeepers pretty much all the time, just with different gear loadouts, the way that Coalition troops come in all shapes and sizes in Rifts? If so, it might be nice to say that pretty specifically and list a few different Peacekeeper (or Ganger) loadouts with different gear and vehicles. I assume you might have plans to release additional materials with antagonist-creation rules or additional lists of baddies, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402340/#Comment_402340" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T08:31:04+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  8:31AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2013 8:32AM by Clint Krause.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for taking a look!<br/><br/>1. That's exactly what I had in mind. I really like the idea of organizing the book around the phases (it seems obvious in retrospect). Also, I think "Mission" could even be one of the phases, so you'd have an explicit starting point (kinda like Mouseguard).<br/><br/>2. The GM is definitely able to create their own antagonists and augment NPC loadouts. I need to make that more clear. The "canonical" NPCs are just for convenience (and to help illustrate the setting). You assume correctly that new NPCs will be a staple feature in all the expansion material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402341/#Comment_402341" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T08:46:15+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  8:46AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it could be useful to talk more about missions. Depending on the nature of the PC group, they could be assigned by a superior in the resistance (go sabotage this thing), be pro-actively invented by the group themselves (we're going to take out the comm-link), be driven by events in play (let's rescue our friend), be driven by necessity (we need to find food), or a number of other things, yeah? If you talk a bit more about that process and, like, do you have one mission per session? Or maybe more if the first mission is accomplished easily? Do you "hotshot" further objectives (to use Bliss Stage language) after you've done what you came to do (I assume so)? I think that would help GMs and players to visualize th structure of play better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402343/#Comment_402343" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T09:14:08+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  9:14AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Radio Underground (3rd Offense, page 31) is the default way to introduce missions. But, yeah, you can also have proactive player-generated motivations, etc . . . <br/><br/>Good points. I'll definitely try to expand the mission section. I tried to be almost excessively concise throughout the text and I suspected that the mission rules might be a little thin. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402344/#Comment_402344" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T09:30:09+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  9:30AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really dig the conciseness, overall.
