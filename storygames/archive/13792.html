Book as soon as possible for any hotel you choose.<br><br>Not from experience, but I know some other folks are vegetarian and attend the con and head out to eat, so I assume it's possible. Food in Indy pretty much sucks no matter what your restrictions or preferences are, so beware.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312164/#Comment_312164" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T04:29:37+00:00" title="February 11, 2011  4:29AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2011 4:31AM by GB_Steve.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We stay at the Stone Soup Inn. It's a B&amp;B about 20 minutes walk ($5 by taxi at 2am) from the convention centre. It's in the old quarter, very peaceful and nice. There was a jeepform run in its sister B&amp;B the Looking Glass Inn (we've also stayed there) two years back but otherwise it's gaming free. It's about $120 a night per room. I wouldn't usually tell you this but our room is already booked.<br><br>The burrito place in the Circle Mall food court is OK and does veggie.

So it's not exactly vegetarian friendly, but it's not a problem.<br><br>I stayed in the Crown Plaza last year and it was pretty nice. It felt a bit out of the way, but it was really a short walk, and it will be shorter this year thanks to the completed expansion. I've also stayed at the Hilton which was nice, and very near to the Embassy (where much of the after-hours gaming happens).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312276/#Comment_312276" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T21:20:10+00:00" title="February 11, 2011  9:20PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I stayed at the Mariott Fairfield Inn and it was a relatively good hotel within walking distance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Wiegand" title="Chris_Wiegand"><img alt="Chris_Wiegand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i1035.photobucket.com/albums/a438/clowndissection/icon2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Wiegand">Chris_Wiegand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312399/#Comment_312399" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T20:15:56+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  8:15PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2011 8:47AM by Chris_Wiegand.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something to keep in mind about the Embassy Suites is that it's sorta the party hotel.  All of the rooms face out over a central atrium that extends from the lobby to the top of the building.  It's cool, but its also a noise amplifier and people have a tendency to stand outside of their rooms and shout to people on the floor above or below them.<br>\n<br/>\nThe Embassy is great if you want to meet people and party, but you might want to think twice about staying there if you want someplace to recover from the sensory overload of Gencon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stayed there back in 2008, and while the free breakfast and free drinks in the evening were fun, it felt more like a continuation of Gencon rather than a break from it.  I should also point out that the AC was out in an entire block of rooms, which included mine, for the duration of the con.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally recommend the downtown Hilton.  It doesn't have the amenities of the Embassy Suites (breakfast, booze), but the suites are an order of magnitude larger and it's even a bit cheaper too!                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
