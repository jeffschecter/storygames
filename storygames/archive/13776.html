I adore the Smallville RPG. I think it's a brilliant and thoroughly intriguing game. <br/><br/>But I have yet to play the Smallville RPG. Likely as not, if I were to play the Smallville RPG, there would be some constraints on what I could and could not do, simply from a realistic point of view. So I'm interested in hearing how Smallville functions with regard to a few specific questions.<br/><br/>(1) Can Smallville accommodate a shifting group of players, where not everyone is always there for every single session? My impression is that the answer is no; every player is playing a character of such importance that it would feel awkward to not have everyone there every session. But then, maybe it's the equivalent of having episodes which are spotlighting certain characters, and not others?<br/><br/>(2) Does Smallville function in a PbP form? I know there's the chapter in the book that specifically talks about online play, but I'm hoping to hear from people who have some experience with it, actually attesting to good times.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311764/#Comment_311764" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T14:53:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  2:53PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan Conway</cite>Can Smallville accommodate a shifting group of players, where not everyone is always there for every single session?

In practice, in a group of 6 (say) players will have 30 relationships between them. Not all of them will be lighting up the table.  The danger of a subgroup showing up is that you might have a plurality of not-so-hot Relationships, and things will drag .<br/><br/>You might also have some trouble with the normal episode creation guidelines, which ask you to create situations based on strains and stresses in relationships between the leads - if you create a situation that strains the people who don't show, it won't have traction.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan Conway</cite>Does Smallville function in a PbP form?

When you make a roll, you roll 1 of your Relationships and 1 of your Values. If the roll isn't about a Value or Relationship, the game suggests it shouldn't be a roll. <br/><br/><b>2.</b> The relationship map you create at the start of the game is an important resource for all the players and the GM. It helps the GM prep for the games and it ensures the players are interconnected.<br/><br/><b>3.</b> Smallville is a somewhat GM prep heavy game. Less than D&amp;D but still considerable. The GM also stats up important NPCs in almost as much details as the PCs themselves. There is plenty of work involved and because it all centers around challenging Relationships, new players would 1 have to have Relationships featured in the game and 2 would need to make their character before the next game to give the GM enough time to prep.<br/><br/><b>Possible solutions:</b><br/><br/><b>1. </b>Have players who drop in and out play the featured NPCs. They usually have a full character sheet and they don't have to be too interconnected into the existing relationships as their purpose is to challenge and drive wedges between relationships.<br/><br/><b>2.</b> There is an option to have episodes (sessions) centered more around Values than Relationships. I would imagine Value centered episodes would be easier to incorporate rotating characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311774/#Comment_311774" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T16:08:58+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  4:08PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.

Everyone's going to need to put a little extra thought into their Relationships and which other parts of the relationship map are shared among multiple characters, asking questions like "If this character is absent from the game, do I have enough other Relationships left to feel okay about playing?" and "Can we still do a scene in the Fortress of Solitude if Superman's not around, or does that kind of miss the whole point of having a scene there?"  You'll have to think about how the map -- and consequently what kinds of stories your game will support -- will change when you drop someone off of it, and whether that fits with what you all want.<br/><br/>And maybe some of the answers you find will tell you that, no, you really can't run the game you want without a stable group, in which case you shouldn't.  Or maybe you can, with some effort: something like the Mission bolt-on JDCorley did might help in a situation like this, for example.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311804/#Comment_311804" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T21:30:00+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  9:30PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thinking falls in line largely with what Cam says. Get all of the players there at the beginning to do character creation. Make sure that those players all have strong relationships with Features. A couple of good Locations will probably help as well, that way there can be a thematic tie to an absent character by having scenes take place in their Location. Encourage players that won't be able to make every session to choose Pathways stuff like "Sidekick", that way they'll get strong supportive elements to their character stats. <br/><br/>I would say that, given the Growth system, players should try to miss no more than two sessions in a row. Otherwise those characters may start to fall behind a bit in scale to the other PCs and may start to get beat up pretty badly by the larger Trouble Pools that more advanced characters generate. <br/><br/>Also, when you don't have your whole group there, do your episode prep using Values instead of Relationships. Using this you'll still have really strong wedges between the characters, but you'll be stressing different parts of those characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311827/#Comment_311827" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T05:01:16+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  5:01AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of great points so far.

And rotating between Value and Relationship focused episodes depending on who is available to play.<br/><br/>Michael makes good point that due to the Growth system, you may have players start to fall behind power wise. <br/><br/>You could use the advice regarding upgrading Features so that they don't fall behind on page 69:\n<blockquote>Be sure to mark on each Feature\u2019s character sheet the number of each episode they appear in. All the Features you introduce in the first episode should be marked with a 1; any Feature that appears in episode five gets a 5.<br/><br/>To make your Features a match for the Leads, you may need to step up a few of their Traits. A rule of thumb is to step up a Trait approximately every three episodes\u2014one Trait for episodes 1-3, another for episodes 4-6, etc. You get the idea. So if your Feature last appeared in episode 3 and it\u2019s now episode 8, step up the Feature\u2019s Traits by 2\u2014either one Trait by two steps or two Traits by one. If a Feature seems underpowered, add another Trait. Whatever feels right to you is probably fine.</blockquote>\nMissing players could describe quickly in flashback where they've been and what happened that allowed them to step up a trait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311842/#Comment_311842" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T07:11:43+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  7:11AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm most of the way through a Smallville PbP game.

I believe it suggests everyone makes a Lead and contribute to the initial relationship map together, then you can switch on and off GMing. The only thing I would suggest is keeping track of how many episodes characters have been in and if there is ever a 2-3 episode disparity, allow the character that is falling behind to step up a trait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311937/#Comment_311937" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T16:10:27+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  4:10PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, rotating GMs is absolutely not a problem, the targets of the GMs are well known to everyone at the table: the relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312008/#Comment_312008" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T06:59:51+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  6:59AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd try to maintain at least a core group of three Leads. The Clark/Lana/Chloe group, from earlier, and then the Clark/Chloe/Lois later on, and now the Clark/Lois/Oliver. But you could switch these all out every "season" if you liked. Switching out Relationships and their statements is pretty easy, really, if you had to do it every once in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that I'm also wondering is how much in advance you know the players are going to ditch the session or not. Prep for Smallville gets easier and easier the more you do it, so eventually you could run the whole thing entirely off the cuff. Just because Josh goes to great lengths to explain episode creation in the book doesn't mean he formally uses that himself any longer. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
