JM asked me to spin off a thread on the subject, so here it is.<br/><br/>So okay, let's start with <i>creative constraints</i>. I'm using the term to mean the limitations and possibilities of a given medium. In this case, I'm mostly talking about the ways imagineering combines with the use of little toy people and scenery in gaming. I'm not going to delve too directly into LARPs, but I'm hoping that some of the LARP designers on the forum will jump in at what comparisons I do make.<br/><br/>In any case, there's a tension in creative constraints. On one hand, the constraint part implies there are boundaries of what you can do, on the other there's a core around which you can focus yor creativity. Pretty simply right? It's like being given an art project where you are tasked with making a vase the subject of a piece of art. How you make that vase the subject is up to you, but it has to be there as the main subject.<br/><br/>Also, for this discussion, I'm going to use a shorthand of "minis" to mean everything related to the minis-use. Obviously, I'm talking about the toy people, but also your action playset/dollhouse stuff, toy trees, and the space to play a game ( usually a table).<br/><br/>So, minis and TTRPGer cluelessness.<br/><br/><b>Step One</b>: Start with the minis and let the creativity flow from there<br/><br/>I'm not kidding. Start with the minis before you go grabbing a game system and writing up whatever sort of pre-adventure/game night planning you do.<br/><br/>Look at them. No really, LOOK at them. What do you see in each individual one?<br/><br/>Chances are good that if you're using gaming minis, especially ones made for RPGs, they've got some real individuality. Get all hippy about it and brainstorm based on the mini. Now do that with a bunch of them. <br/><br/>Step back and look at your collection as a whole. Make the mental connections between them, based on what you've just done. If it helps, think of it as a fuzzy version of an R-Map.<br/><br/>Also, think about the implications of those interrelationships in terms of what it could imply about a setting and situation.<br/><br/><b>Edited to add an afterthought:</b> Toy soldiers in, wargame out<br/>Seriously. Most minis use is going to be action packed, the same as the vast majority of non-minis using RPGing. However, if you want to go at least a little farther afield than just gun battles, buy some non-combatant figures early on! They don't all need to be shop keeprs and whatnot. Adventurous or interesting types of minis do exist that aren't all immediately blasting up the landscape or lopping off someone's head. In fact, for main characters and recurring characters, I strongly suggest the less uberviolent minis be chosen. Even for a Conan-type game setting.<br/><br/><i>Only after you've done that should you even begin to consider a system ( whether off the shelf or your own homebrew).</i><br/><br/><b>Step Two:</b> Plan from the minis<br/>If you've only got N minis of certain tyes, use that as a springboard to creativity instead of knocking your head against the limitation and wailing and moaning. I see this  a lot in discussions of minis-use. I find it a bit like a player decrying how desperately unfair it is that there are no rules for Mecha in their Middle Earth game.<br/><br/>If you've got stuff for a jungle adventure, play a jungle adventure. If you've only got a handful of minis, play a game where that handful is going to matter most. If you've got a weido collection of mismatched stuff, think about how that fits together.<br/><br/>At this point, try not to substitute. Almost all minis use will inevitably lead to some kind of practical compromises, but don't start withat right now. That comes later.<br/><br/><b>Step Three:</b> Accept that minis use is most easily accomplished with a relatively static arena of play<br/><br/>This is a key creative constraint! It's also another place where non-minis TTRPGers tend to bang headlong into a wall. In TTRPGS, and especially S-Gs, play can entail a whole bunch of changes of locations and quite possibly quite a bit of on-the-fly location creation. This is much more constrained with minis use.<br/><br/>Why? Because resetting up a table is a complete pain in the ass.<br/><br/>Unlike wargamers, however, there are a few things RPGers can do that will make some fuzziness a little easier. When wargamers play, they tend to set up an entire table and then go with it being totally static. It's kinda important in context. We don't have to do quite that. We can play with tabletop scale in alll sorts of interesting ways.<br/><br/>The key thing when planning for and setting out our arena of play is to have several major locations that we'll be using for this evening's play. The in between areas can be more amorphous.<br/><br/>The closest thing I can compare this to is the islands in Archipelago. Each island on the map is a location that is distinct and slightly seperated by water, and while their physical relationship implies stuff, we don't let them bleed too much together. What those locations are and how they interrelate is going to be determined by what you have available in terms of minis and what the general theme of the night's play is. It could be rooms in a dungeon, areas of a town, a broad countryside, or some combination. The thing is, you need to go into it expecting that those core locations are going to be relatively static. You won't be repositioning the castle half way across the board each time a scene changes.<br/><br/>As for playing with scale, I point you back to your own childhood toy play experiences. Chances are good that as a kid you didn't worry too awful much that ground scale was accurate. You probably didn't even think too much about it. Nor did you worry about representing every inch of a given location being accurately represented, just the key parts. If you're old enough, and a boy especially, you might recall the old Kenner Death Star playset: It had three or four levels with each representing some cool thing about the Death Star and you played with your action-figures on it and it was good enough. It seems fashion doll dollhouses work pretty much the same way. Take this and apply it to your arena of play locations,and the table as a whole!<br/><br/>It does not matter that your cantina has the same tabletop footprint as your wicked forest or your mysterious runis in the lost valley as long as each location, each playset shows what's important, ignores what isn't, and makes sense locally, and is very likely to come up during the night's gaming.<br/><br/><b>Step Four:</b> One day at a time<br/>If you're going to use minis and do it up, don't be afraid to simply declare an evening's play to be a relatively self-contained event and put your focus of creative efforts there. And here I mean both players and planners. Save the big location changing stuff for the next session or sometime down the road.<br/><br/><b>Step Five:</b> Over the long-haul, build on what you've got<br/><i>Start with a village and dungeon </i>is kinda old-skool Basic D&amp;D advice, but it applies here, too, maybe doubly so, because you're talking about a different sort of effort here, and some real-world budgetary concerns. Whatever you're minis collection involves, it can grow over time, or become more refined. Play in a way that allows re-use and recycling if you're just starting out with a small collection of stuff. Mooks are easy to recycle, and so are generic landscape bits. For personalities, play in a way that it makes sense to re-use them as their original character as much as possible.<br/><br/>And then, as you play, add new stuff or single locations.<br/><br/><b>Step Six:</b> Take a page from Dirty Hippy Story-Games- Everyone's effort is important to success<br/>If you're going to play in a minis using game, especially over the long term, figure out how you're going to contribute to its success, even if you aren't an arts'n'crafts type. Sometimes, this will mean actually spending money, or putting it in the hands of someone else to spend. Sorry, that's the truth of the thing. <br/><br/>Barring that though, you can do all kinds of non-spending stuff that will help play. Go through the excersises above and come up with new stuff to do, new relationships or new characters based on figures. Save useful recycling bits for the crafty types to use for new terrain. Help do really basic painting and landscaping work. Help cart the stuff, or organize the play area, and act as the social secretary/GM's whip to insure the bodies make the game ( like telephoning the FLGS and reserviing table space (Caesar X is the master of this sort of stuff)). Printout and assemble freebie terrain from sites online, or even other cool props for the players to use, or do some work recording the session in photos or text.<br/><br/>An <i>I just show up and play my character</i> attitude is just as detrimental to minis play as it is to other gaming.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246211/#Comment_246211" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T09:40:15+00:00" title="December 11, 2009  9:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've sort of lost me, with the Steps. What do they reveal: That I have to work with what I've got, physically, in minis use? That's sort of true and sort of not--I've played TTRPGs with minis and yet didn't feel very constrained, in terms of story or relationships or roles (but I have a LOT of minis, with Mage Knight and Hero Clix, so...). And I've almost always used a battle mat with markers, so the only scenic limits were what I could draw (i.e. anything, if folks are willing to squint; i.e. use imagination). Scale and such-like was obviously relevant, else the minis wouldn't be setup--and, frankly, don't MOST TTRPG players that use minis occasionally ignore them for some scenes? Mini TTRPG play seems to me to be employed when the game (or the particular scene and conflict) has a lot of tactical element, even if the game system (and even situation!) ALSO has strategic, narrative, social, etc mechanics (e.g. D&amp;D and Hero System both have highly granular tactical mechanics... but they also have Diplomacy skills and Presence attacks).<br/><br/>As for the parallel to LARP, I'd say LARP is MORE constrained, not of parallel constraint. One can "ignore the minis" as I said above, but it is MUCH harder to "ignore our bodies" and RP in LARP without paying attention to position, stance, body language, etc. Furthermore, it's one thing to lay out some game terrain or draw on a battle mat; it's a-whole-nother thing to build even a "sketchy" set at human scale. The LARPs that do so are often expensive or heavily supported (staff and materiel). Even further still, the player capabilities, via their characters, are more constrained: I can imagine a flying PC in TTRPG, and I can even represent that PC in flight with minis (in a variety of ways) and ask the GM for information that a flying person would have (surrounding area beyond ground-level visibility) or make moves that a flyer could do (over obstacles like buildings). But in LARP, having a PC flyer is, at best, a serious drain on GM time and a cause of play-flow disruptions, as the flyer asks for privileged info or demands "stop times" so that he or she can "fly" over (i.e. walk around) a building or what-not. It's just not doable in a fair (as in, "fair to all paying customers") way... so you don't have Flight in LARP.<br/><br/>It should be obvious how to extend that example of flight to a variety of other common physical abilities. But yet-another constraint comes in with many LARP players (but not all!): the issue of player protagonism. Everyone is a Hero with a Capital H. As such, it can be hard to employ a game system that has effects like Mind Control or Seduction. The character/player divide is far narrower, and even the "best" actors can find it unfun to be told what their characters must do; all the more so, if told by another PC (or worse still: a less experienced player--a "newb" in a long-running game group). In TTRPGs, the GM is usually the one to do any sort of "puppeting" of a PC; in LARP, there just aren't enough GMs, usually, for such individual attention (aside from, for instance, line modules or guided encounters).<br/><br/>Lastly, there is also a lot of drive for WYSIWYG in LARP: costuming, make-up, realistic (albeit safe) props and weapons, sets and special effects. This is primarily done out of a desire to minimize how much others must suspend disbelief; but it also comes from a drive for verisimilitude, especially in live combat games (i.e. "boffer LARPs"). And now you REALLY got a constraint on the play: never mind the costs to be kitted out; if one must actually hit with a foam sword or birdseed packet, one must have actual skills, some fitness, and one must practice! Sure, "stat-play LARPs" can let the slow, out-of-shape, half-blind person be a superior swordsman or dexterous archer; but there's only so far you can go with stats to make that guy win consistently in actual melees or shooting matches. (And, these days, most games find those stat adjustments to be more hassle than they're worth, in terms of noise from damage calls and ever-escalating arms races of "plus to damage" versus "damage resistances".)<br/><br/>So LARP's got constraints of:<br/>* actual physical presence to participate in--or even be aware of--events,<br/>* ability to physically represent things--adversaries, obstacles, settings--in the world, and<br/>* individual physical ability to portray the PC as imagined.<br/><br/>Minis do not, I feel, bring ANY of those constraints, so long as one has imagination, a good set of colored pens and battle mat, and a system whose mechanics let you occasionally ignore mini positioning (and related terrain/sets) entirely.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246212/#Comment_246212" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T09:53:06+00:00" title="December 11, 2009  9:53AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2009 9:56AM by komradebob.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Edit: Crossposted with David</b><br/><br/>Comparison to LARP Creative Constraints<br/><br/>For the record, I have never, ever designed or organized a LARP, although I've played in a couple. The first three were different ongoing Vamp Larps played casually at local bars. One was a weekend event combining oWoDLarp with Bofferage. The final one was a one-shot, afternoon four hour Wodehouse larp called Muudsummer Mischief.<br/><br/>Having said that, here are some of the similarities I see-<br/><br/>Planning<br/>Even the very casual, ongoing Vamp LARPs involved several people taking the bull by the horns and engaing in some planning and keeping things together, and at a much more involved level than your typical tabletop game. While there were certainly casual players who flitted in and out ( like myself), the thing only really worked due to people making a real effort to keep the thing going. Like minis gaming, there's less pick-up-and-play that's easily accomplished.<br/><br/>You might have to spend some money as a player<br/>As with minis gaming, players may have to spend some money to be involved and have the thing work successfully. It might be for costuming, or weapons. Some of it may be voluntary or just good social graces, but it's important to be aware that it isn't the sort of gaming where you can always simply show up with a " I'm here, Let's play" attitude and expect other folks to entertain you. Certainly not over the long term, anyway. It isn't so much like TTRPG where you can get away with one core book and some dice for a whole group for a very long time, and that can be expected to be provided by a GM.<br/><br/>Arena of play<br/>While I know Levi K has doen some nifty stuff with morphable location building on the fly for some LARPs he's run, generally you'll be working with a semi-limited arena of play. In minis use, thats the locations on the tabletop. For LARPs, that's the physical area you're playing in. And, at some level, folks have to account for that. It isn't impossible to make stuff up on the fly, or change locations, but you're probably vastly better off trying to work with what you have than trying to push super hard against those boundaries.<br/><br/>What you have will determine what you can do<br/>In LARPs, this kinda means the pool of likely players you can get together; in minis it's your minis collection and space to play. Either one can be built up over time. OTOH, trying to plan for something way out of scale with what you have available does tend to be a recipe for frustration.<br/><br/>Re-use and Recycle<br/>Both physical stuff, locations, and characters. This seems to happen quite frequently in both and it's probably better to plan towards this than fight against it. Some of this ties back in to budgetary constraints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246214/#Comment_246214" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T09:54:35+00:00" title="December 11, 2009  9:54AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2009 10:00AM by ColinC.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Toy soldiers in, wargame out<br/>Seriously.

So I keep trying to make one, but damned if I can ever seem to settle on one I'm happy with.<br/><br/>David:<br/>Some of your comments on being able to get by with just markers, a sheet and whatever minis are on hand strike me as if I showed up at yor LARP in jeans and a t-shirt and argued that I should just be able to play with boffer-folks by twirling my arm about "fencing" Errol Flynn style , because, hey- Imagination! <br/><br/>WYSIWYG with minis is important, too. I don't mean with no compromise ever-that's a path to madness or at least a severely drained bank account!<br/><br/>Regarding scale and minis use, I'm thinking more of the sort of situation I've seen come up in LARPs where someone declares that that area over there some wher is, I dunno, the next town over's tavern. And that area over there is the throne room. Or something. We don't really worry about scale in those  ccases in a larp. It would be impractical to make some players march 5 miles to play at the tavern even if it would be "correct" theoretically and staying within the idea of not ignoring the physical aspect. Likewise, if the throne room area is important, presumably it exists within a castle, but we don't generally feel the need to represent the entirety of the castle, just the relevent parts of it.<br/><br/>The same applies to what I'm talking about with minis.<br/><br/>Now tactical space <i>within</i> a location, that may well be important, both for minis play and for LARPs. But again, we may play with scale even there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246223/#Comment_246223" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T10:23:44+00:00" title="December 11, 2009 10:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So interesting.

I've played games where the minis were very abstracted Lego figures (not even Lego figs!) and the scenery was some books and glasses, and the "crowd of innocents" were marijuana buds scattered around the battle field (you can guess how we handled "collateral damage"). Did that "break" our immersion or make it harder to know who's where and what's what? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>But I've never played in a LARP where folks could play creatures the size of buses or flying people or teleporters (with one exception: two players portraying a single blink dog NPC in boffer combat!) or any number of relatively common character types.<br/><br/>* Every game in which I have used minis has sometimes NOT used them, has almost never had "photo-realistic" terrain or props, and has been able to model things that no one could even sort of fake, in LARP.<br/><br/>* Every LARP in which I have played has encouraged but not required costuming, used a variety of hack-up ways to make sets, and yet still had a very strong "if you do it, it happened" and "stay in character at all times" vibe.<br/><br/>So I would say the second half of your attempted reductio ad absurdum is, in fact, possible and happens... but not the "wave around arms" to fight (unless a heavily stat-based and turn-based game system). Hence the reason that I say that LARPs are, generally, more constraining than minis, not parallel or equivalent. Minis play is more fluid with time, location, and even use of minis (or not); LARP just isn't, typically. Sure, you get throne rooms without the surrounding castle (though I've never personally played in such a setup, in boffer). But you never get "four hours later" or "that cabin over there is on the other side of the planet" because there's more of a WYSIWYG drive in most LARPs.<br/><br/>So there's definitely some overlap, and the "stories one can tell" or "events that can happen" are constrained to SOME degree in both. But real world safety, costs, and need for isolation (or secret play) in LARP constrain a player's options far, far more. That's why I've never seen a true superhero LARP, yet have routinely played all sorts of insane superhero scenarios using minis. That's why I've never seen a LARP employ a TON of the most common tropes of high fantasy games/myths. That's why the more modern the LARP setting, the easier it is to maintain verisimilitude and suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>I can imagine your PC flying, even if it's a mini sitting on top of a glass jar or telescoping rod; I can't imagine that you are flying, even if you flap your arms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246235/#Comment_246235" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T11:07:35+00:00" title="December 11, 2009 11:07AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly tl;dr but using two players for a teleporting opponent in a boffer LARP is genius.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246238/#Comment_246238" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T11:18:53+00:00" title="December 11, 2009 11:18AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a blast (I was one of the two)!

So I thought a bit about David's comments.<br/><br/>Trying to bring this thing back around a bit, a similarity I am seeing is that for both minis gamers and LARPers, a certain amount of verisimilitude in the physical stuff is desirable. It is different between the two, but there seems to be a shared attraction in it to both groups.<br/><br/>And, that desire seems to be important and common to both in a way it isn't for TTRPGs ( the ones without minis use or minimlaist minis use).<br/><br/>It also seems interesting to me some of the comments David has made regaring the sorts of games created within theconstarints he chooses to work with. For example, the   tendency to play more modern setting stuff, because of ease-of-play + a desire for verisimilitude in the arena of play. Again, IMO, that has parallels in the "collection type" aspect of minis play.<br/><br/>David: What part does "re-use" as an issue play in the LARPs you've done. For example, how do the limitations of having access to say one or two real world physical locations and an assortment of props aid/constrain what sorts of games you play?<br/><br/>OTOH, in what ways does the urge to create new props or look into using a different location play into yourLARP game planning and execution?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247121/#Comment_247121" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T12:25:33+00:00" title="December 16, 2009 12:25PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a LARP organization, there's primarily a draw to the modular and, to a degree, the generic: easy to install and move partitions (to use to setup interior spaces); and basic weapons, costume elements, and makeup for NPCs. The real-world cost of building anything "full scale" (or human scale, in general) means you REALLY don't want it to be too specific or stylized--today's interior dungeon wall (a painted sheet or plywood board) might be part of tomorrow's hedge maze. This is one of the push-pulls of verisimilitude versus cost. it's a shame, too--if LARP groups could get together and cooperate (or collectivize), then all SORTS of stuff could be shared, combined, etc to make far more compelling sets.<br/><br/>Personally, I have a fair amount of Ren wear and even some plate, so I am ready for just about any fantasy (and some historical). I also have a fair amount of "punk" or "post-apoc" wear, and of course modern clothes like suits and so-forth. I can drop into nearly any genre with no additional expense, so I feel no real "constraint" to choosing what I play (it won't surprise my regular readers to know that the SYSTEM in use matters FAR more, to me).<br/><br/>And, further, I have enough skills with sewing and sewing machines, tool use, etc that I welcome a chance to come up with a new prop or costuming element, particularly accessories (which make a character more than clothes, when you get down to it). For instance, one of the GLASS playtests that I want to run is in a Neolithic time period, with shamanic magics, ridiculous Captain Caveman clubs, etc. I could make passable kit for that game for, like, $20. AND some of it could be re-purposed easily (the "skins" becoming fur "mantles" or "capes"; reusing the ridicu-club as an Orc or Ogre (N)PC). I reckon that's my organizer instincts being applied to individual kit: nothing is single-purpose. (The Alton Brown Theory of Prop Making\xae)<br/><br/>As for location, that's probably more a horse-before-cart issue. On OCCASION, access to some sweet location crops up for a group. More often, a game type is envisioned, then space is acquired that supports it. And there's a LOT of LARP spaces out there: City and State Parks (including their facilities); friends' acreage with outbuildings or barns; unused warehouse space; nearly any public space (more often for parlor LARP, not boffer or Airsoft, obviously). To make a minis parallel: it's like someone's already made all the terrain and you've just got to borrow or rent it on a routine basis (assuming not some one-shot, like the LARP cruise or LARPs that run in EXPENSIVE-ass castles for rent). And you've got 20 to 200 folks helping to cover the rent.<br/><br/>Anyhow, for me, it's rare that "I wanna make Prop X" is the motivation--one notable exception being an idea of a battle mage that motivated me to build a boffer with a special basket guard that would help me to hold onto packets while I used its weapon (mostly) defensively (I also have designs for shields with packet "bandoleers" on their inward faces; but others have developed that concept independently of me; and shields suck balls after 40 hours straight gaming!). That was one memorable case (for me) of putting the prop before the course (heh). MOST often, an inspiration for a genre or setting comes first, then a cool character idea, then I go through my kit racks, seeing what I can put together, and THEN I go and make or acquire additional kit to finish out the concept (almost always an accessory or two and a new boffer weapon or stylized weapon). But, hey, maybe I'm not a common LARPer--I can easily imagine someone with (say) a $1000 16th Century armor set not wanting to fuck with post-apoc (or Neolithic) games because all that gear sits at home. I, myself, have leather-covered, 16 ga. steel, Lorica Segmentata armor that I'd LOVE to find an excuse to wear, like, monthly; but I don't pine for it at Halloween parties, cons, Ren Fests, or even LARPs where I might wear it but don't (the three former, due to comfort and politeness; the latter, because it doesn't suit my character concept). Ditto my $400 suede doublet--I could wear that fucker daily (why, oh WHY, didn't Neo-Romaticism last longer than the 80s and Prince's early heyday?!?). But that doesn't mean I would only ever play a fantasy or Roman/Middle Ages game.<br/><br/>Am I helping, here? I got a bit rambling, and the curse of TLDR has, apparently, become a "thing" here at SG lately (seems to me--I don't recall seeing that phrase before this month). It's hard to answer you briefly because half of it is player-facing and half of it is organizer-facing, and those groups often have very different sets of motivations for things like locales and sets and props. Even for myself, I have a slew of organizer and player motivations in dynamic tension: test GLASS v play in a Big Game; plenty of kit for a few genres v desire to try unusual genres and settings; investment risks v enjoyment of set and prop making. Maybe we stick to a player focus, in this thread, as its OP rests on "minis ~= LARP" and, as mini games rarely have organizer teams, we can really only compare and contrast from a player perspective (unless we want to expand issues of mini play to tournament, demo/hosted games, and leagues?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247397/#Comment_247397" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T14:30:59+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  2:30PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My LARP experience is limited (a few Vampire games some horrible Star Trek games and a Changeling game I used a puppet in (That was fun!) but I can see that they take planning and require either a LOT of imagination or accept a lot of limitations.<br/><br/>Miniatures on the other hand are limited but can go much further afield. I've got a lot of figures because I used to do Matrix Games as miniatures events. I moved away from it because I wanted to sell game and realized that minis are prohibitively expensive and I don't sell them so why continue to write games for them? When I read through Bob's comments I could see all his points and it reminded my of HG Well's "Floor Games". The different bits of terrain were what captured Wells' son's imaginations but he never told us how he ran the games which I believe means it was all made up on the spot. <br/><br/>Miniatures beg to be moved around and made to act. This usually means fighting. That is what Howard Whitehouse's "Amazing Stories" does. That can be fun but is totally one shot. No replay at all. But doing a more cerebral game just leaves the figures standing there. Maybe moving people around is a little fun but tying mini to terrain to mental action is a tough stretch. I personally put it on the back burner when I started making board games. Maybe I'll return to them someday. <br/><br/>So I'm at the "Sounds like it could be fun but I don't know how." stage.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247412/#Comment_247412" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T16:40:58+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  4:40PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 5:45PM by komradebob.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've noticed is that, with minis, like LARPs multiple like minded people make the whole thing better. Like in a minis club social context.<br/><br/>Hmm. Now I'm wondering what sorts of organizational levels things I can steal from LARPs and apply.<br/><br/>I've been hacking at something that combines some freeform Larpish stuff +group situation creation which then leads into one-off minis gaming sessions.<br/><br/>But not exactly the way you might think: The LARPish part is a Hollywood soiree set up. The context is that the players are various Movie Maker types. The idea is for them to use the soiree time and the various collections of minis provided by the minis-heads in the group and some sort of yet-undesigned posterboard forms to pitch movie ideas ( including moving minis from sidetables to the poster boards and marking the posterboards up and stuff) during the course of the soiree.<br/><br/>By the end of the soiree, there should be at least a couple of promising ideas. Someone (probably one of the minis-heads, but not necessarily) then chooses to develop and produce the film (the one-off game) or more optimistically a couple different ideas get picked up by different "producers". Hopefully the producers also get some preliminary commitment from players (actors) at this point as well.<br/><br/>Not quite sure how that level ties down to the minis game level mechanically. The game mechanical level though is decidely more about moviethink than fiddly tactical BS.<br/><br/>And yeah, I completely stole the movie concept from PTA and Howard Whitehouse's game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
