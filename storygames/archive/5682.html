Elegant, very legible, easy to read, easy to use as a reference. Absolutely peerless. Those are the games that immediately leap to mind. I also quite like the Avalon Hill era of Runequest.<br/><br/>In more recent times, I think the layout work on the Dying Earth series of books that were directly handled in the UK (Sarah Wroot?) are also in the same class. The ones that were done in the US based on her style are not nearly as good, but are still serviceable.<br/><br/>In all these cases, the proportions are elegant, the typesetting fundamentally sound, making the pages easy to read and a pleasure to look at. It's easy to find things later, and easy to read them through. And the incorporation of the wonderful art by Horsley (in DE) and such clean and classic-style illustrators as Liz Danforth and Lisa Free (in the older Chaosium books), as well as the lucky happenstance of getting permission to use Hal Foster's original illos for Valiant, make for a pretty much unbeatable final product: if I had to choose one game that was all-around the best laid-out "of all time", I'd have to say a tie between the Pendragon 3rd ed rulebook, and Prince Valiant, with perhaps a slight edge to the latter.<br/><br/>It just occurs to me, I can think of another example of excellent art married with excellent, clean layout: the English language version of Reve de Dragon by Malcontent Games. I'm not keen on the the font choice used as I think the Uncial style font is a bit hard to read, despite matching the style of the game, but the layouts are crisp clean and well organized, and the illustrations are well placed, evocative, and stunningly well done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kintara" title="Kintara"><img alt="Kintara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kintara">Kintara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127186/#Comment_127186" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-17T15:00:17+00:00" title="February 17, 2008  3:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobilis would be the one book that I would describe as being laid out extravagantly.

And I love the way the are quotes interspersed in the margins.<br/><br/>For some it might have been too extravagant, though, as the Great White Book wasn't cheap.

Chaosium of the early '80s is nigh-untouchable, IMO.<br/><br/>The first example that leaps to my mind is <i>Burning Wheel</i>. I think Mr. Crane did an insane layout job with the revised ed.<br/><br/>Next, I'd say WotC's Eberron line. I love the typography, love the graphic design.<br/><br/>While I'm not nuts about <i>Ars Magica</i>, I'm one of those wacky few who think the layout of 5e was excellent.<br/><br/>Oh, and most of the Malhavoc products. When other d20 upstarts were all jumping on the ornate page-border train, Malhavoc went with super-clean lines and lots of while space. It's funny that people complained how "boring" the look was, but now Malhavoc's contemporaries look like the proverbial bell-bottoms and avocado kitchen appliances in comparison.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127192/#Comment_127192" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-17T16:02:57+00:00" title="February 17, 2008  4:02PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2008 4:03PM by J_Walton.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my opinion, the best layout in a roleplaying game is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Engel</a> products put out by Feder &amp; Schwert, a German studio.
