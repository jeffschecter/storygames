Shadow and Light (S&amp;L) is finally ready to be shown and play test. But, first what is it exactly?<br/>ExiStanc3 is about, in fact, four different products :<br/>- Avalanche, a campaign, set in a fantasy world. It can be played with [almost] any system. It is a hard cover, 450 pages.<br/>- Shadow and Light, our system. It can be used to play with campaigns other than Avalanche. It is a 32/48 pages "booklet", accompanied by players' aids.<br/>- The character's sheet of S&amp;L for Avalanche. Soft cover, 250 pages.<br/>- A website to manage campaign and systems.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know, this is a lot of things, and thanks to <i>this</i> community, we have decided to release those products separately. The next product is going to be Avalanche.<br/><br/>Now, back to this thread. First, some disclaimers :<br/>- S&amp;L is far from finished. It is, in fact, at this moment, in an "alpha version".<br/>- Strangely, we have finish, in some part, the <i>end</i> of the project : the layout and design.<br/>- What we have, at the moment, are the characters' sheet, character's burner (to create characters) and the players' aid.<br/>- But not the <i>rules</i>. Heap ...<br/>- We do think it is playable and understandable with the current material at hands (if you already know what rpg are).<br/>- So, we want to distribute the material, have people test it, play it. We'll use the material on the local scene here (Montreal).<br/>- From the feedback, we'll start to build the rule book. We want it light and full of examples. We want to look like a FFG rule book (games of throne, WoW, Starcraft ...).<br/>- We want to build a community (and so far, we're not there yet) and one important lack we have, is some material. So here it is.<br/>- We are not native English speakers. Before going into [the cost] of a professional translation, we want to make sure the material is all right.<br/>- When presenting "how to use" some setting/story in relation with S&amp;L, we'll use the structure of Avalanche. Don't be surprised.<br/>- Everything is not perfect with the material, so we expect feedbacks<br/><br/>Our goal with S&amp;L :<br/>- To produce a "generic" role playing game rules set<br/>- We want a <i>elegant</i> simple set of rules<br/>- We want to produce a beautiful rulebook which will help understand how rpg are played and what they are<br/>- We are targeting non gamers, casual rpg players, rpg curious people, and traditional boardgamers for the <i>final product</i><br/><br/>The goal of this thread :<br/>- We want feedback of the material<br/>- We are currently targeting professionals, players that know role playing games and that can play test the game, be some kind of "ambassadors" for us<br/>- This is different than the customers we mentioned earlier (please, keep this in mind)<br/>- We're using this thread to prepare/complete a specific web page on our website. It would look somehow as this thread. So, we also want feedback on the presentation as a whole.<br/>- Speaking of other forums, I thought of therpgsite and some groups on LinkedIn. Do you have any other suggestions (see below on the context of KickStarter)?<br/><br/>About KickStarter and promotion/"call to action" :<br/>- We had in mind to do a big campaign of ExiStanc3, that would include S&amp;L, Avalanche and the website.<br/>- Now, we think we should do three smaller ones : one for S&amp;L, one for Avalanche, one for the website (this decision really comes from talking to people in this community). What do you think of this?<br/>- So, we would be kickstarting the production of the rules book<br/>- Keep this in mind with the material : we want to present something elegant with people wanting the final rules set (by the KickStarter campaign)<br/>- Given that, how and where should I target my audience<br/>- Notice our "call to actions" on the page : ask questions on Facebook, try it and post a picture of the character on Facebook and Twitter<br/><br/>So, let's do this. You are the lab rats. Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421798/#Comment_421798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T08:53:52+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  8:53AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2013 1:09PM by pells.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi to all. We've been working on a role playing game project for some time now, and we are quite happy to present you the rules set, <b>Shadow and Light</b> (<b>S&amp;L</b>). Well, in fact, and to be precise, we're presenting you the material you need to play, and not the exact set of rules. And, we need your help and expertise to complete those rules. <br/><br/>We're very interested in all feedback you can give us and if you want to use the material yourself, you can get the zip here : www.existanc3.com/stuff/ShadowAndLight_Playtest_package.zip (with all the images in high resolution format). <br/>You can also ask questions or leave comments on our Facebook page and if you ever feel about sharing your play test with us, you can take a picture of the final character sheet and post on Twitter, using the ashtag <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23takeastance&amp;Mode=like">#takeastance</a>.<br/><br/><b>General presentation</b><br/>Shadow and Light is a system to be used in your role playing games. In its current version, it is configured to be used with a classic fantasy setting, but S&amp;L is meant to be generic and could be used with your space operas, science fiction, horror or cyberpunk games.<br/><br/>Shadow and Light is meant to be light rules, fast paced, easy to learn and an adaptable role playing game rules set. S&amp;L helps you put the emphasizes of your games on the story, your players' story, and your players' play style. With Shadow and Light, you can manage at the same table, different kind of stories, different kind of players, using the same rules set. <br/><br/>In fact, Shadow and Light is so easy to use, as a GM, you don't need to teach how to play to your players. Just go ahead and create characters, start your adventures.  Following this simple steps below, you can create your own characters and play a short story in about 90 to 120 minutes to see if you like this game.<br/>Are you ready?<br/><br/><b>Origins and thanks</b><br/>Shadow and Light was not produced <i>ex nihilo</i>, and we owe a lot to the role playing game community, without whom, S&amp;L wouldn't exist.<br/>Our special thanks and influences are : burning wheel, the shadow of yesterday, dungeons and dragons, spirit of the century/FATE, white wolf, warhammer, ars magica and the dark eye.<br/><br/><b>The material - overview</b><br/>All the material below allows to create your characters and start your own game. For this, you will also need some kind of setting or adventures : a place or a world for the heroes to have their stories.<br/><br/>Here's a couple of things you need to keep in mind, when playing with Shadow and Light :<br/>- This system is best used in an environment where you are playing in good faith, helping each other to have fun. S&amp;L works badly in a very competitive environment.<br/>- Whenever there is a doubt about a rule, or a situation, the group decides together.<br/>- It uses a pool system, that represent "hits points". So, you have 4 types of hit points : body, sense, heart and mind. <br/>Note : magic is the fifth type. It is considered also a normal pool, except, it is very rare that you will ever <i>battle</i> over this specific pool.<br/>- Each pool influences the others : if you fight over your "body" (with a sword, for instance) and you get blinded (sense) or dazzled (mind), you will fight <i>badly</i>.<br/>- Here's how it works when you have a conflict : you choose a pool as the "sphere" of conflict. Then an attribute (related to the pool), then a skill (related to the attribute), then as many acquis as you want/have (those are swords, titles, spells ... name it you have it) : it gets you a number of dices (d6) to throw. You have success on 5s or 6s.<br/>- Here's a rules you need to keep in mind : <br/>a single acquis can't provide more dices than the skill used, the skill used can't provide more dices than the attributes used, the attributes can't provide more dices than the pool. Or, if you prefer :<br/><b>pool &gt;= attribute &gt;= skill &gt;= single acquis</b><br/>- You can always transform 4 dices into an automatic success.<br/><br/><b>The character creation</b><br/>Before getting into the specific of the character creation for S&amp;L, we recommend that you talk with your players about the type of characters they want to play. For this, you can use some imagery from the world they're going to play in. No need to go into specific here, just general ideas.<br/><br/>Creating a character in Shadow and Light uses a character burner <i>and a set of four colors pencil (red, yellow, blue and green)</i> : it is a sheet dedicated to the creation of the characters, sheet that you will throw away later.<br/>The creation of a character is a four steps process. At each step, you distribute the same number of points, of the same color (you choose the colors at step one). All the steps work the same. <br/><i>Think of it as putting some colored marbles that you distribute in a physical object, with the "magic marbles" (the black ones) being used as joker. It is a binary system : at each step, you "push forward" the colored marbles.</i><br/><br/>For the first three steps, you'll need the character burner side A :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/CharacterBurnerSideA.jpg"/><br/><br/>Just follow the instructions on the left.<br/><b>Note</b> : characters should have at least one point in each pool. Having zero point in a pool (except for magic, which would be to describe a commoner) represents "odd creature". For instance, a ghost has 0 in body, a zombie, 0 in mind.<br/><br/>For the fourth and last step, you'll need to use the character burner side B (rewrite your pools points at the center as a reminder) :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/CharacterBurnerSideB.jpg"/><br/><br/>For this step, keep in mind that the written acquis are only examples. Those examples are on purpose simple and follow the color of the pools to give you ideas.<br/>Maybe, you want some other examples of acquis, so we're providing this sheet of examples :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/AcquisExamples.jpg"/><br/><br/>All the acquis work [almost] the same. Here's a quick overview of the various types :<br/>Object : they can be lost, found, forged. They are weapons, books, armor.<br/>Resources : they bring you some kind of "money". They may be acquired, bought, lost, sold. They are a inn, a mansion, a title, a pension.<br/>Spells : they can be learned or given by a "greater power". They are fireball, sleep, mind control.<br/>Motivations : what drives you characters. They may be chosen or forfeited. They are "defend the poor", "gain power", "find the assassin". They provide XP and dices.<br/>Traits : who is your character. It might be "fierce", "elegant", "discreet" ... Just be careful with those, as they can backfire at you.<br/>Specialties : take a skill and get better at it. They are learned. Combat : sword, ride : horse. Those are for your hardcore gamers who want to max out their character.<br/>Relations : they might be bought, gained, lost, killed or irrelevant in a distant land. They are slaves, bodyguard, wife/husband, children, a friend of the king, an assistant.<br/>Gifts : those are the extraordinary things your characters can do. They are learned, given. They might be lost. They do not provide dices during a conflict. But, if you tap in your pool (fatigue), you can add many more dices all at once. They are master pyromancer, expert bowmen, infrared vision. You want them as general as possible.<br/><br/>Important notes : <br/>- At some point, for a given acquis, you may ask yourself where it should fit. Is it a gift? A resource? A trait? It's up for you to decide (and the rest of the group to validate). You need another type of acquis? Just create it.<br/>- Each and every acquis might turn out to be an advantage or a disadvantage, given a certain situation. "Being a friend of the king" is an advantage at the court, but it surely hinders you in dark alleys, late at night.<br/><br/>[Edit to fix the link to the zip]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421799/#Comment_421799" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T08:54:13+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  8:54AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, you rewrite the data from your character burner on your character sheet :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/CharacterSheetBlank.jpg"/><br/><br/>You can destroy the character burner now (or keep it as a souvenir). Here's an example of what a character looks like (note this is a very powerful character) :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/CharacterSheetExampleSophia.jpg"/><br/><br/>You're now ready to go on an adventure : you have some characters, their motivations, traits, some assets, maybe enemies they fear or friends they cherish. Are they member of a group that is going into trouble? Are they a little bit too ambitious and shadowing some important characters of the realm?<br/>In all cases, at this point, you should have developed some parts of the world, fleshed the foundation of stories to come.<br/>How about bringing some stakes to your story? Let's put your players right into the adventure.<br/><br/><b>Battles</b><br/>What you need to resolve a <i>battle</i>, refer to this sheet :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/PlayersAidSideA.jpg"/><br/><br/>Important notes :<br/>- battles are resolved the exact same way in every pool<br/>- anyone, including the GM, can transform a scene (a battle resolved in a single die roll) into a task resolution (dealing each blow one after the other)<br/>- when in doubt, or if you're doing something for the first time, use the task resolution system<br/>- when resolving a scene, always negotiate the consequences before rolling the dices<br/>- this is a <i>simplified</i> version of the rules. There are not <i>much more</i> complicated, but they can cover more complex situations (large group, many pools involved ...)<br/><br/><b>Other details</b><br/>You'll find on this page everything else you need to know :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/PlayersAidSideB.jpg"/><br/><br/>How to use gifts, how damage and fatigue work, how your character progresses and some other general rules.<br/><br/>Maybe you already have a setting, maybe not. Here's the B side of the last player's aid, a map of the Land of Exiles, the world of Avalanche :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/TheLandsOfExile.jpg"/><br/><br/>Here's the the first look of the rules book in <a href="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/ShadowAndLightRulesBookLayout.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>.

One more coming Sunday and Tuesday.<br/><br/><b>The context</b><br/>We were going to playtest with Israel, a game designer, who's in charge to sell rpg in a store as a living. A real test. <br/>He came in with two other players : they were casual gamers (they didn't play rpg much, and they were with their "expert" friend, which is fine). There was no real expectation : they were trying out a "new", unfinished system.<br/><br/><b>The best</b><br/>- What we call our "wheel of wind" (see <a href="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/CharacterBurnerSideA.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>). This is a sure winner. And this is a thing that makes us unique.<br/>- Did they have fun and do they want to play again? Yes.<br/><br/><b>The good</b><br/>- it took 45 minutes to create the characters.<br/>- they then played for something like an hour ...<br/>- They did get the system very fast. On the first roll dice, they got it. On the following, they felt in control.<br/>- They liked the pool system : the fact that every aspects influence the others (mind, heart, body, sense)<br/>- Avalanche stood well. But, strangely, it wasn't the essence that inspired them, but the actions, the existence. What can I say ... We have both. Use both.<br/>- They like how collaboration worked. But I guess it is now a standard in the industry. It works like BW and TSOY.<br/>- What marketing target are we "on"? Casual gamer? Yes. Returning player? Yes. Hardcore player? Yes (to our surprise). The player's girlfriend? Yes. The boardgame player? No (see the ugly below).<br/><br/><b>The bad</b><br/>- It took some time for them to decide what they wanted to play ... We have to remember that this is a "prototype" play, not a campaign setup. They are looking for an adventure. Maybe we should have brought up some pre-made characters ... Creating characters might not be for everyone.<br/>- Maybe we should change "magic" for something like "heroic". Magic has some "connotations" to it ...<br/>- When creating the character (see step 1 to 3), it felt more intuitive to them to do 3 then 2, then 1. Strangely, my 7 years old boy did the opposite. We need to allow both. And this is a strength.<br/>- Our acquis are not enough about "Avalanche". We should not have a "sword", but "a Theobald knight's sword". We have to remember this is a playtesting kit. It needs to be anchored into the setting. S&amp;L might be universal, but as of now, the only one using it is Avalanche.<br/>- Israel was blind colored. Our nightmare!!! We need a "print friendly" version (i.e. B&amp;W version).<br/><br/><b>The ugly</b><br/>- As it is now, no one else beside us can playtest it. We need some "adventure pack" stuff ... something for a non gamer to know what to do about about Avalanche ... We're working on this. It should look like players' aid.<br/>- We're not going to be displayed on the boardgame shelves of stores ... we're far from it. That said, we came to the "idea" of a boardgame variation ... but it is not the same product.<br/>- What we have to think about now is : "what about the "entry" product to the hobby"? How do we make available? Easy to use? We're not there yet.<br/>- Another decisive decision : is S&amp;L and Avalanche two different lines of products? Or do they get along? We need to take a stance here.<br/><br/>Next playtest Sunday. And we learned a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422546/#Comment_422546" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T09:51:22+00:00" title="October  7, 2013  9:51AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Second "real" playtest for Shadow and Light. This time with total strangers, as we were at <a href="http://www.larecreation.ca/" rel="nofollow">la recreation</a> here, in Montreal.<br/><br/>We had two players, one was a boardgame designer, the other had never played pen and paper rpg (but it seems that mass effect or fallout are candidate as "rpg").<br/>We played for about three hours.<br/><br/><b>The best</b><br/>- Our character burner is the real thing. The players didn't even bother to use the "real" character sheet.<br/>- So, I guess we have to change it a little and allow it to be use as the character sheet for our demo (just remove the instructions on the left and put some place for the acquis)<br/>- They would have continued to play and they really had fun.<br/><br/><b>The good</b><br/>- Our system is easy. Very easy and it feels like it. They compared the difficulty to some boardgames there.<br/>- Avalanche stood the test pretty well. It is just that big book, fill with ideas, that you can flip around.<br/>- We didn't encounter the problem we had with the "inspiration" and the use of Avalanche, but the players seemed to look at Avalanche as a "book of secrets".<br/>- They like the somehow "free form" aspect of S&amp;L : you name your stuff and we decide together how to use it.<br/>- We removed some of the rules which were there to avoid some "abuse" of the system. Well, there was no need for those rules. Sometime we may come to create problems ourselves ...<br/><br/><b>The bad</b><br/>- We still have problems with "what do you want to play?". It seems people, at least in the context of a demo, needs to be guided.<br/>- We're currently working on "archetypes". The players would choose three things : their race, their "class/occupation", the place they come from.<br/>- Each one would come with a "card" that provides you with some points already distributed for your character.<br/><br/><b>The ugly</b><br/>- There was a bit of a crowd there and we got some : "Pen and paper rpg? Grrrrr ... no thanks!!!"<br/><br/>Next playtest : tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
