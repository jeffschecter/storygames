He seemed skeptical<br/><br/>Take a wild guess what the outcome of the entire game hinged upon? *sigh*                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78658/#Comment_78658" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T23:34:09+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 11:34PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 11:43PM by Albert A.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Peter's defense, neither outcome involved him winning.

I had a Scuttler that could get to that base with a move. However, Peter did have two other mechs that could move into capture-prevention range. So, in order to make <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> happen, my Scuttler needed to move before either of Peter's mechs, to capture his base before he could move to defend it. <br/><br/>Naturally, Scuttler rolled crap for initiative.<br/><br/>I don't know if you're familiar with the game rules, but in Mechaton, if a mech is the target of an attack before his initiative comes up, he is immediately activated so that he can roll for his defense. After the attacker's attack resolves, he takes the rest of his turn. This is called "combat initiative", and is most often used for manipulating how your opponent's turn plays out.<br/><br/>My artillery mech on the rear lines had better initiative than either of Peter's mechs.<br/><br/>It resulted in fun little bit of fiction:<br/>Commander: DAMN IT, SKTLR2 isn't going to make it to the base in time!<br/>Artie: I'll see if I can encourage him a bit, sir! *blam blam blam*<br/>SKTLR2: AAAGH! *scuttle scuttle scuttle*<br/><br/>(It's worth noting that I made sure to allocate my low die to my attack value, so I didn't actually <i>hurt</i> the Scuttler... just lit a fire under his ass)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
