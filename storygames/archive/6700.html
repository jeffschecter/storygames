I've been fiddling with some of the rules stuff and I think I came up with an idea that's worth posting here and seeing what other people think.  Let's start with the reasons for me making this kitbash.  <br/><br/>Recently I've been running a mecha RPG with mixed results.  The game has been fun in spite of the system, not because of it.  Things were moving too slowly, conflicts would get bogged down, and the thick forest of modifiers mystified the two people sitting at my table that were brand-spanking-new to gaming.  We all sat around and talked two weeks ago and decided that we'd like to continue our game, but change the system.  We wanted something that the mech anime's have, the big beautiful combats and the sweeping character moments.  We wanted something where the conflicts were fast, action-packed, and fun.  So it seems that Spirit of the Century is exactly what the doctor ordered.  <br/><br/>Now comes the fun part.  I love Aspects in SotC.  They are a highlight of the game.  The way they put the characters' personalities, styles, and desires front and center is something that I really think will help give the game a little bit of that "bigger than life" feel that Mecha Anime seem to have.  But I need a little something more.  <br/><br/>Mecha Anime, as it is with a lot of Anime in general, is largely about adolescence and the transition from childhood into adulthood.  Macross, Evangelion, Gundam, RahXephon, almost all of them have this as a central theme.  Even something like Macross Plus, with its adult characters, is about leaving behind the pains of a shared childhood and embracing the future.  <br/><br/>What I'm looking for is character change, character evolution.  I'm not really concerned with a character getting really good at fighting, or piloting, or whatever.  I'm not even thinking about characters discovering new parts of themselves, like a character being an excitement junkie but then also becoming a selfless defender of the innocent.  What I really want is for a character to make a decision about himself, to draw a line in the sand, and for that to alter him forever.  I want a character to say "This is <i>what I was</i>.  And this is <i>what I am now</i>."  And I want that to be in the rules.  <br/><br/>SotC doesn't really <i>do</i> change.  It's not built to.  Pulp stories are about immutable good guys facing terrible odds, so SotC doesn't need to worry about those things.  As for the core system, Fate, it does character growth but not change, and I'm not really looking for growth.  In Fate, new Aspects stack one on top of the other giving you a character with a lot of history and depth, but not quite the "I'm becoming a brand new person" that is at the core of character progression in those great anime.  I don't want characters to simply get better at what the do, I want them to change irrevocably.  <br/><br/>Think about that scene at the end of Macross Plus when Guld realizes that he was wrong about Isamu and takes on the Phantom all on his own?  Or how about Kamina from RahXephon, as he finally stops ignoring his feelings and lets himself fall in love with Haruka?  Or when Amuro turns back to the White Base after running away with the Gundam, and defends those people he left behind?  It's those moments that I'm looking to capture.<br/><br/>So this is my idea.  Aspects have three functions; invoke, tag, and compel.  The important function here is the Compel.  When a PC's Aspect is compelled, the player either has to act out the Aspect and gains a fate point for his troubles, or he can pay a fate point to the GM and resist the compel.  What if there was a third option?  What if you could break the compel?<br/><br/>Breaking would mean that a character not only resists the problem that comes up from the Aspect, but completely denies the Aspect in total.  The character changes.  He becomes someone new.  And he gets <i>a whole bunch</i> of power on top of it...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148522/#Comment_148522" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T21:49:03+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  9:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2008 9:54PM by MPOSullivan.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the breakdown, rules-wise.  A player can Break an Aspect whenever called upon to act in accordance with a Compel.  The player not only resists the Compel, but changes entirely.  The Aspect that is broken is gone forever, erased from the character sheet, and replaced with a new one right then and there.  The new Aspect must reflect the new outlook on life that the character has adopted in this moment.  On top of this, the player doesn't have to pay to resist the compel and actually earns himself five more fate points.  <br/><br/>But there's no turning back.  Once the Aspect has been Broken, it's gone forever.  And just to make things more fun, the new Aspect that the player chooses for his character is considered Unbreakable.  The new Aspect can never be changed again.  This is who the character is now, who he has let himself become.  A caterpillar can't come out of the cocoon a moth and then crawl back inside and try to become a butterfly.  <br/><br/>Basically, think Aspects from SotC crossed with Keys from tSoY, with just a dash of MIsspent Youth.<br/><br/>I imagine it working like this in-game.  \n<blockquote>Let's say that I'm the GM ('cause I am) and that my friend Nora is playing her character, the mecha pilot with the very appropriate callsign of Shellshock.  Shellshock has an aspect that's called "Cowardly".  The current scene is of her and the rest of her flight of mecha having just gotten into a big ol' melee with a gigantic monster.  <br/><br/>I think it might be fun if, in the heat of the moment, I compel Shellshock to get scared and have her break the line, letting the monster get past her and towards the buildings full of civilians behind her.  Only, Shellshock doesn't think that.  There's too much at risk.  Innocent lives weigh in the balance.  She's done being scared.  She's going to stand tall.  <br/><br/>Nora laughs at the fate chip I hold up in her face.  "I Break the Aspect!" she yells as she slams her fist down on the table, shaking all of the fudge dice around.  <br/><br/>I raise my eyebrow a little.  "Alllllright... So, what's the new part of your character?" I ask, knowing this is a big moment.  "How are you changing?"<br/><br/>Nora juts her chin up in the air with pride.  "I'm done running away.  I'm "Never Backing Down Again"."<br/><br/>That new Aspect is just too cool for words.  I smile and happily slide over five tasty new fate chips in Nora's direction and wait to see what she does next.</blockquote>\nOr maybe you want some negative Aspect action?  How about this?\n<blockquote>Let's say that my buddy Zoe has a character with the Aspect "Always follows orders".  We're in a scene where the PCs have just fended off some monsters and I decide to Compel Zoe's character, Panda Bear (strange callsign, I know.  Don't ask) with orders from the base telling her to let them go.  <br/><br/>"I just can't do that, sir" Zoe says nervously.  <br/><br/>"What?" I say in return, waggilng the fate ship side to side.  <br/><br/>"After what they did... they've got to pay."  Zoe holds her hand up against my fate chip.  <br/><br/>I decide to escalate and bring up two fate chips.  "Are you disobeying the orders of your commanding officer?"<br/><br/>Zoe gets a gleeful look in her eyes and smiles.  "Instead of replying, Panda just starts to growl a little, and that rises into a blood-curdling battle cry.  Like everyone does in an anime."  She looks at me and says "I'm breaking the Aspect.  And I want to replace it with... oooh... Bloodthirsty."<br/><br/>I slide over five fate chips and start thinking about all of the wicked new Compels I get to work with as Panda breaks off from the rest of her squadron and flies off to face the enemy all alone.  </blockquote>\n<br/>So, things are still up in the air, and I haven't had the chance to playtest the idea yet, but I'm certainly enamored with it.  I haven't got the best grasp of the SotC rules yet, but I think this could really work.  What do you guys think?  Are there any changes that you guys can think of that I should make?  Any pitfalls that I might find myself in with something like this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148542/#Comment_148542" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T02:39:31+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  2:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What do you guys think?</blockquote>\nI think I love you.

It's not, not necessarily. SotC talks about changing characters through a "shuffling" process as well as an additive one, and while that book doesn't go into it at too much length, precisely because of the "episode-oriented" playstyle you mentioned, teasing out some more detail from that might get you some of what you're after.<br/><br/>Consider a game where shuffling is the only form of advancement - the idea here is, you can only move stuff around inside the "scaffolding" of ten aspects, a Superb skill pyramid, and five stunts. So, there's no change of scale happening in terms of character effectiveness - they'll always have ten aspects, a Superb skill pyramid, and five stunts. <br/><br/>In this setup, the only way to get new permanent aspects is to "resolve" the ones you have somehow, and then replace them with new ones. Sometimes these will follow logically from the old one - [Avenge My Father's Death] might change to [Seeking New Life Purpose] if you get your revenge. Or maybe there's just something new happening in play that's you want to flag as a point of interest for future sessions, so you might resolve [Advisor to the President] by quitting or getting fired, and pick up [Cara Volkov, Double Agent] because you want to see that NPC again. Or maybe you're just looking at your sheet one day and go, "You know, [Compulsively Religious] kind of stopped being relevant a while ago, and I haven't used it in a while... eh, let's get rid of it. Any ideas what I should replace it with?"<br/><br/>Consider that after a long enough period of time doing this, your character is going to be completely different than when you started - you'll have ten different aspects, your skill pyramid might have a different peak on it, and you might have picked up five new stunts to suit your current schtick better. You would basically have a totally new character sheet. <br/><br/>Isn't this basically the transformation you're describing? "Oh, yes... once I was an ambitious Air Corps runt like you, but now I spend most of my time here in this garage... the prospect of building things started to appeal to me more than blowing them up."\n<blockquote>What if you could break the compel?</blockquote>\nBuyoff mechanics for aspects have been a fairly popular topic on the FateRPG Yahoo group since TSOY came out with Keys. I have usually just allowed players to switch out aspects for new ones whenever it seemed relevant in the story, but I can totally understand why you'd want mechanical reinforcement for it.<br/><br/>When I tried it, I allowed the player to sacrifice an aspect for a full refresh... losing the aspect means the refresh also goes down by 1, so if they start with 10 aspects and ditch one, they fill up to 9 FP. Rather than do the replacement immediately, I allowed them to pick up a new aspect with the next advancement/shuffling cycle. This gave the buyoff a weighty feel, made it seem like a consequential choice, and allowed the player to think a little bit about what would be the best aspect to replace the lost one with, roleplay through the change, etc.<br/><br/>But I don't see why yours wouldn't work, too.\n<blockquote><cite>Joel said:</cite>I mean, sure, you permanently revoke an aspect, but (speaking purely from an effectiveness standpoint) who wants a cruddy ol' aspect like Cowardly anyway? The system looks like a convenient way to buy off flaws. . .or rather, you get to sell off your flaws. Seems like removing a negative Aspect should cost the character and player, rather than reward them.</blockquote>\nI don't know how familiar you are with the system, Joel, but there aren't really any such things as positive and negative aspects... nearly any of them can be used for the character's benefit as well as to complicate their lives or limit their choices. 'Cowardly' might be invoked by the player to avoid harm, convince someone they aren't worth the effort, etc. just like it might be compelled by the GM to bring danger to them for the irony of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149054/#Comment_149054" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T12:58:08+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:58PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do get the concept that Aspects are both positive and negative (read the game, never played it). it still seems that some aspects are more positive or negative than others (the text even speaks of Aspects that way a bit). And a lot of times an aspect that's being "bought off" will be a more "character flaw" kind of thing, even if it does provide advantage.
