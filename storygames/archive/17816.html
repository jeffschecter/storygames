Fourth draft!  Revised again!  Less changes, but still hard to list them all.<br/><br/>In this game, you are the Host of a Daemon, who grants you supernatural powers.  In the game, you will be going on numerous quests across Aporia as Hosts.<br/><br/>Allows a lot of GM freedom.  Let me know how this is!<br/><br/><i>Legend says that the ruins of the great cities of the Ascended hold treasures unimaginable by the average human. Ikarr, the Lord of the powerful Itaran Enclave in the Wastelands, has heard of a great temple in the nearby ruins of the giant city Crypt. These rumors, he claims, come from a reliable source.  However, there is a problem. Crypt is notorious for its great number of Ragers. Many souls have wandered there, only to lose their mind in the process.<br/>Will the group make it through the dangerous city alive?

You can do that, but keeping the thread allows for those who've bookmarked it to keep track easier, gives a place for new readers to check out what's already been said regarding the previous version, and keeps the thread list from getting clogged. It's not that big of a deal, just a little piece of advice.<br/><br/>Alright, got it open now. Let's see...<br/>Wait a second, this pdf is 95 freaking pages?! *flip flip flip*<br/>...did you intend to include the book three times over in here? That seems like a pretty odd mistake.<br/><br/>Okay, I meant to ask this last time actually, but where's the art come from behind the intro to the world and all? Didya make it, find it somewhere that allowed open use, or is there someone you ought to be crediting? It's pretty cool though.<br/><br/>Ah, Aporia. Definitely less generic than Terrania. Out of curiosity, does it mean anything specific, or just sound good?<br/>I see a couple other name switches. The Restoration is a pretty good one, I personally prefer it over The Sanctity. Same with enclaves (I better have liked that after suggesting it last time...).<br/>This phrase doesn't work great: "Hosts were quickly dehumanized." I'm not sure what it is about dehumanized that bothers me, because logically it makes sense, but there could be stronger words out there. I jump to "demonized" but with all this talk of Daemons and the actual nature of the Hosts would say, well, duh they're demonized, they're literally host to Daemons. The idea of some word in the vein of demonized might be stronger still stands though - just give it a check, I could totally be wrong and dehumanized could be better than any of 'em.<br/>I didn't memorize the previous draft, so maybe I'm just not remembering, but I like the explanation of the groups more. They get right to the point. EDIT: Yup, they didn't change. I guess I just read 'em a bit closer this time.<br/>The language in "...but part of the Restoration, than to be extremely kind, and a Host." is a bit awkward to read. Read it to yourself out loud, then pass it off to someone else (parent, brother, friend, w/e) and have them read it out loud to make sure other people interpret your phrasing the way you intend. Also, "incredibly advancing in technology" is kind of an odd turn of phrase - although I definitely caught it this time that you've got sci-fi tech!<br/><br/>Remember, this intro is the first thing your readers will likely see and read. It sets up the world, but this is still the place where you want the players to know what their role in the game will be. In fact, you do a decent job of making ALL the groups sound pretty dismal - the Restoration is all-destroying, the Purgers are unknowable monsters bent on the destruction of Daemons, and the Hosts are outcasts in anarchy and, by your words, are criminals (though they commit for survival) (also "they work crimes" isn't great language, I think you want "commit crimes"). I think it would be really worth checking out the Shadowrun and Eclipse Phase (especially Shadowrun does a good job of this) core rulebooks, and Leverage might have a good one too though I don't have that game - these are all games in which the entire world is falling apart around you and closing in on all sides, forcing your characters into crime to survive. Your characters, like the Hosts, have to do bad things sometimes, but the texts I mentioned do a great job of <i>framing the characters as good guys</i>.<br/>(if you have no way to really look at any of these and are interested, send me a whisper or a message or something and I'll send you an image of the relevant page from my Shadowrun book)<br/>If it looks like I'm taking a lot of time on the intro, it's intentional. This is probably, next to the actual mechanisms of the system, the most important bit to word <i>just right</i>.<br/>It may be worth actually keeping this mostly intact and integrating it as the intro to the World section alone and writing a separate "Intro To The Game" elevator pitch/book-back text.<br/>Oops, most of the arbitrary caps are gone but Government is still there. If you have a reason for that though, let me know what it is, because otherwise it's just arbitrary.<br/><br/>Moving on from the intro finally! I like the description of Aporia. You arbitrarily capitalized "Technology" at the top by the way. You probably want "what could <b>end</b> that" in regard to utopia - it's a state, rather than an action. I could be wrong about that language bit though. More language bits, I'll try to get them out of the way: "cities were ruined, massacred, and..." - you can't massacre a city, you probably want to throw a word like "people" or "humanity" in before "massacred." "<b>had</b> their great cities." - That one's just a typo I think. "and they are aged" is technically plausible, but I think there're more interesting ways to word that. Utopia in the fourth paragraph is arbitrarily capitalized unless that was the name of the civilization (potentially stepping into cliche territory, but also cool enough to probably be okay with that). In fact, the whole fourth paragraph is kinda weird to read - do the same read-out-loud, pass-to-friend-to-read thing and try a couple variations.<br/>Speaking of "aged," let's talk time. Now, we've established that we're 3000 years in the future. That might be a bit far (remember a couple sci-fi examples: the Halo universe is 500-600 years in the future, the Mass Effect universe is less than 200 years off, and the entire Star Trek continuity mostly fits about 200-400 years from now). You can totally do it, but you would really need to consider just how far technology would have advanced in that much time. Just food for thought - there's no reason you CAN'T do 3000. I mean, sometimes time gets to make no sense (such as Battlestar Galactica).<br/>Now, assuming we're in the future. The day came and the rifts opened and soon the world's near-dead and the Ascended are dead. Now let's fast-forward again to the date of the first play session - how far forward did we just go? Was the fall of the utopia long ago now, just a distant memory in the stories of the Aporians left to deal with the fallout? Is this almost immediately after, the Purgers still a new thing to everyone? I suspect somewhere in between, but that could be worth thinking about.<br/>If you plan on assuming that the GM alone is the one who's going to be reading this, call that out. I'm resistant to the idea of "there's awesome stuff out there, just make stuff up GM" - later, I'd provide some examples. Unless that's what the high-tech from the gear list is, in which case they DON'T really need to make it up.<br/>Watch out about just throwing out the idea of a Multiverse theory and then not explaining it yet. This could be a good place to elaborate a bit instead of condensing.<br/><br/>cont. in next post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403105/#Comment_403105" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T18:23:49+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  6:23PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Abyss! Okay, let's look at this...<br/>Well, actually I haven't any language concerns on this page. Nice job. The closest I have is that "No one knows for sure if it exists, but legend says it does." is just kinda boring - viable, but probably capable of being phrased in a more interesting way.<br/>I'm conflicted about having a section like that, a GM-only section, right here up front. Perhaps this will be slid into a position I'm more comfortable with through the general process of evolution here though, and without a dedicated GM section it doesn't really have any place better to be. Oh well.<br/>I've already expressed some concern about "think of the most disturbing thing you can think of." Come on, this is <i>THE</i> place to "barf forth apocalyptica," to "blanket the world in darkness," in non-quoted-words to show off just how terrifying and amazing your setting is and how evocative you can be. All of the games I'm really attracted to are steeped in the imagery of their settings - my best example is also the only setting that really genuinely frightens me in all the RPGs I've read: Don't Rest Your Head. When I first read its supplement Don't Lose Your Mind, I literally couldn't sleep that night from it - you can get scary from having your GMs generate it, or you can scare even them with just how frightening this can really be. In ADDITION to that, you can say for them to add the scariest details they can think of. Also, call them out that they should think carefully about how to integrate their PCs' own Phobias into the game.<br/>Overall, this part's pretty good.<br/><br/>The Daemons now. I'm still weirded out by the description of them as "noble" (I don't think it really tells us much in itself) and havign the winkin' at us is just strange - I'd remove it, your GMs know to fill in your blanks when the time comes.<br/>"His name was the Overlord". I'd consider changing it to "He was called the Overlord" unless Overlord actually was his name.<br/>"They were <b>powerful</b>, with incredible abilities and <b>power</b>" You kinda have a circular logic thing going on there, they were powerful cuz they had power.<br/>"But nothing can stop an army powerful enough." I'm just plain not sure what you just said. Take another shot at that one.<br/>Watch out about using Elders both here and on the Elder Purger. They can be differentiated, but personally I wouldn't risk reader confusion.<br/>"awoke one day to a horror" is an odd turn of phrase.<br/>"the Purgers came and <b>destroyed the creations cities</b> of the Daemons..." I think there was a typing oversight here.<br/>Here's a question: if Daemons are real and tangible, aren't they visible until reve- hold it, you removed the Reveal thing! Okay, good to know, never mind.<br/>This is a case where I would say that there's no need to have a GM-only bit. The name of the boss Eternal is the Elder Purger - it's pretty obvious (to me) that they're being controlled by the Eternals. The "why" bit is something I'm comfortable with leaving up to groups to create, personally. It's simply easier to have less GM-only stuff in areas the players could very well read.<br/><br/>Restoration!<br/>"...that have not been killed, <b>nor</b> have they been bound to a Daemon." That's the change I'd make there, based on my reading of the line.<br/>Oh, is this the same idea of Sanctuary as last time or did you retool the Sanctuaries idea, cuz this is a cool thing.<br/>Oh wait, um, "The law enforcement of <b>Faundor</b> is...". Old name for it you forgot to cover up? Or a different thing?<br/>"month-long massacres" I don't think massacres is the word you're looking for. Killing sprees would work though, and there are probably a couple other choices too.<br/>Faundor again in that last body of text. Hmm - is this intended as the actual name? Cuz in this case I actually like Sanctuary as the city's name. Nice to see that there IS dissent though - not the <i>whole</i> world is stacked against the players. Gotta have some room for social interation after all.<br/>Overall, the Restoration excites me more than the Purgers as a game's plot arc. That's just my own preference though, and a good sign for the Restoration rather than a bad one for the Purgers.<br/><br/>Oops, you called them The Sanctity at the top of the Host page!<br/>"Being a host is incredibly depressing" is a depressingly boring line. Any way to jazz it up a bit?<br/>Be careful with a phrase like "an impossibly large desert," as in it isn't very good. This is something I myself was only learning about, like, yesterday, reading Ryan Macklin's blog - he did a couple articles on some phrases to avoid in writing (since he's a professional editor if I'm not mistaken) and one of those articles was on adverbs. Impossibly is NOT a synonym for very. Here's that article if you're curious - great stuff to keep in mind. <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2012/11/bad-phrases-2-adverbs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ryanmacklin.com/2012/11/bad-phrases-2-adverbs/</a><br/>Anyway, I'm not so sure about the writing of the section on the sanity (no caps!) tests. It feels like it's not fitting the same tone as the rest. I'd recommend making a couple variant versions of that paragraph and seeing if any of them feels any better. As usual, check with some other people if the words make sense how they are.<br/><br/>Well, right off the bat, Descension isn't a word. I think you wanted Descent but had the idea of ascension in your mind.<br/>So, what's the difference between an Incumancer and a Host? Using the powers? Would all of the players be Incumancers as well by that logic?<br/><br/>Heh, couldn't think of any Natural feats of PSI after all, eh? looks good though.<br/>Reword "the player gets one (you typo'd the word one btw) free d6 for every natural feat they try to accomplish." This sounds like its cumulative, that for every time you try a natural feat you get another dice, which is of course NOT what you mean. Perhaps "First, the player starts with one free d6 simply for attempting a natural feat." <br/><br/>The rewrites under Sueprnatural feats looks very nice.<br/>Leveling is fine. <br/><br/>I have a question: Why label the page "Special Case" now? Without Revealing, it's just merging. Just make it a page dedicated to merging. Also I think it would be better to say "Separating" rather than "Demerging." I think it would just flow a bit more naturally.<br/><br/>The more specific Phobia and Skill lists are excellent. A couple odd choices I don't think would come up/the players likely wouldn't choose, but it's way better. (for reference, the ones I'm thinking of are Bacteriophobia being rare, Malaxophobia for being rare, Agoraphobia for being unchosen/unfun in play, Gephyrophobia for being rare, Either Ballistophobia or Hoplophobia for being similar to each other, and Daemonophobia because no one is EVER going to pick it) (if you're curious, if I was playing I'd probably do Autophobia)<br/><br/>Notice that you're locking out ALL two-handed weapons from starting characters. Maybe that's intentional though. Not gonna super-closely-read the gear list right now though.<br/><br/>All in all, a solid improvement of the draft! There are obviously still some things to work on, but it's mostly wording stuff and mis- or un-explained things. The numbers will have to be crunched out by someone better at that than me, or ironed out through actually playing the game, but there are enough good ideas and the numbers look generally okay enough that it would probably function well enough. With these revisions, I'd be actually willing to try playing it myself (if I had room in my gaming schedule right now). Nice job, and keep up the good work!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Foroth" title="Foroth"><img alt="Foroth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Foroth">Foroth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403155/#Comment_403155" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T05:21:01+00:00" title="January  9, 2013  5:21AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright!

It's not an uncommon way for folks to try to call attention to words they consider important, but it's really not a great practice in my own experience unless you intend to be turning it into a name (eg government is a social structure, Government would be the <b>name </b>of an overarching government representative of governments in general). It feels like a way to emphasize something, but there are better ways to do so, such as font trickery (such as bolding, or using a special font - this is NOT a fix-all still though) or rephrasing it in a way that puts the focus on the word/phrase.<br/><br/>But yeah, any time.

It's fun to be giving the help as well <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Well, let's get to it then!<br/><br/>Let's hit something I've entirely left out before: the cover. A couple comments:<br/>The title image itself is okay. It's pretty rough, but whatever, this is a playtest draft, art doesn't matter (as long as it's copyright-clean, as previously discussed, and I'm pretty sure this title is fine).<br/>I assume Nexus Games is you. However, at this point, while it might sound cool to have a title like that, I'd recommend on the playtest draft you just put your name or handle and a couple contact links for feedback (email, maybe this thread, anywhere else you want feedback sent, stuff like that). Eventually, a company name'll be good, but at this point it's not really necessary. More importantly, I don't know how copyright on names works, but there happens to already be a STORE called Nexus Games in Gresham, Oregon. This might be fine, or could be problematic, I honestly haven't a clue. It really doesn't matter yet - as I've said, just contact info is good for now probably.<br/>And lastly, my biggest issue is the For Experienced Role-players bit. This is a dangerous phrase to jump around with. It can go over well - if I'm not mistaken, Don't Rest Your Head calls itself that at first. But it's important to really nail down what you mean there and whether that phrase is really what you're after. On one side, that's totally applicable by the definition that you're not going over the <i>idea</i> of a roleplaying game or any of the other stuff most big-budget RPGs tuck into their fronts. People have to be familiar with the basic concepts of RPGs to read this, and by that meaning, yeah, this is for "Experienced Role-players." On the other hand, this phrase can imply a bad form of exclusivity - this is for people who are good at roleplaying, and if you're still relatively new you shouldn't play it. That's actually not applicable at all, as your system is simple and easy to understand (thanks to its system base of The Pool/Lady Blackbird). Especially, I would say that the phrase is entirely unnecessary <i>for now</i>. You're getting feedback and playtesting - no one out there who's never played an RPG before is accidentally at risk of picking it up and being super-baffled. If this goes further, eventually, it might be worth calling out the lack of explanation (and then I would put it on, like, the first page rather than the cover, something like "This game assumes a mild amount of experience with role-playing games, such as the basic idea of playing a collaborative story-telling game in which we represent characters. If you do not know the basic idea of what an RPG is, this is likely not the game for you."). Not necessary quite yet though. See where I'm coming from here?<br/><br/>Haha, I guess I was right on the art. This looks good, especially as far as being a quick thing on a playtest draft.<br/>700 years is definitely a bit more swallow-able (though I realize I gave a lot of points to a shorter time last time, but no real examples of a justification of a longer time - I'll present Warhammer 40,000, who's technology has managed to mostly stagnate after a certain point even after <b>40</b>,000 years, let alone 3000. Personally I prefer the shorter time, but I thought I'd present that there <b>is</b> an alternative).<br/>Knowing the context, I like Aporia even more. Of course, don't call it out in the text or anything, I'm just saying that for me.<br/>The phrase "All of society was nearly thrown into the ruin." 2 beefs: "nearly" isn't quite true even - all the Ascended died. Plus it's not that great of a flowing sentence, if you're attached to saying nearly (likely to imply that people still live), I'd recommend restructuring the sentence as "Nearly all of society...". The other one is that "into the ruin" isn't quite good english. You either want something like "into ruin" or "into the turmoil" or some such.<br/>I'm not super-fond of the exact phrasing of "Other creatures that came through the Rift, called Daemons, meant the Humans (that shouldn't be capitalized) no harm." The interjection of their name feels like it breaks up the sentence in a sub-optimal. Here's an example of one way to do it that would gel with me personally: "Other creatures came through the Rift, called Daemons, who meant the humans no harm." Or another possibility; "Other creatures, called Daemons, also came through the Rift, but the Daemons meant the humans no harm." Try a couple and see how it goes and see if you can't find one that you think flows nicely.<br/>Once again, you capitalized Governement in the paragraph right after the list of Daemons. You also capitalized Humans there.<br/>In the Purgers paragraph, you used a "However" interjection twice. If you've got another phrasing to offer up some variety, it might help there. (I tend to use "though" quite a bit, but there are a plethora of good choices, including the simple "but"). The content of those sentences is fine, it's just a phrasing similarity that's weird to read.<br/>"What do the Purgers have to plan against Aporia" is weird to read. I would recommend rephrasing entirely (my examples: "What do the Purgers have in store for Aporia" "What are the Purgers planning for Aporia").<br/><br/>Now that you've <i>explicitly</i> called this out as an Intro, you DEFINITELY need to confront "Who are the players playing, what do you DO in this game" somewhere here. It still reads as a brief to the world rather than an introduction to the game as a whole. Read the back of any character-driven RPG you can think of/get your hands on. Apoclaypse World. Monsterhearts. 3:16 Carnage Amongst The Stars. Dogs In The Vineyard (this one is really compelling). These are a small sampling of a couple RPGs I picked up off my table that are decent examples of writing the intro about compelling players (including the GM) rather than just being an information dump. The information dump is compelling, but in the sort of way that would attract me to read a novel of the setting rather than make my own character and fight the world myself.<br/>As a counter-point to myself, I <i>do</i> have a couple RPGs that DON'T specifically address themselves about who the players are and what they're doing. One exmaple is Ribbon Drive by Joe Mcdaldno. The back is more about the type of story that will be told - one of letting go on the open road. It tells you that this'll be a road-trip game fueled by player-brought mixtapes, leading toward a couple genre-common themes. You're playing characters, but this would be an example of where I think the story itself overrides the goals and hopes of the characters, and thus the sort of story that will be created is not the point he brings attention to on the intro. (there is also the chance that Joe would write it toward the players if/when he does it again, it <i>was</i> one of his earlier RPGs and <i>is</i> getting a revision, so I don't know). The other example I have is from Ben Lehman's game Polaris. I don't have it in front of me, but if I recall the back is more about the world and the story that will be told. Again, this is a game where story more overrode the characters own goals (for example, eventually death or insanity will be the fate of your character, without fail, so it's more about the story). This is a setting where the setting description is told in an evocative and interesting way rather than an informative one - I'm drawn in because of the way it's written rather than for being interested in the explicit setting details. He then has his world/history explanation chapter, which is where he explains the sort of things you chose to put in your intro.<br/><br/>cont. in next post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403325/#Comment_403325" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T10:15:31+00:00" title="January 10, 2013 10:15AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside, these are character-driven games still, even those where the story takes some priority. A couple games NOT like that necessarily would be Microscope (where you do not advocate for specific characters tied to players) and Fiasco (where your game is character driven, but you shouldn't really be advocating for the character when the story would otherwise benefit). Presumably Durance is like Fiasco in that. You'll notice both of these are GMless, but that's not a rule - Polaris is also GMless, but you ARE advocating for your character. I think that's the sticking point for that.<br/>The lessons I would take is that an intro should focus not on the world but on the people playing. You can describe the world and who the players are and what they're doing, but you've also got the option to describe the world and the sort of stories this world will tell. However, for your game and the way it's structured, I think the individual choices and motivations of the characters is the driving point, rather than a movement of the story as a whole.<br/>Do you get what I'm playing at here? This is a hard thing to do. I'm dreading writing my own introduction page for Avatar World, this is NOT an easy thing that takes a lot of subtle manipulation to make work. That's why I'm harping on it so much, it's really vital.<br/><br/>Let's move past the intro now!<br/>The "What could stop that" line is still weird.<br/>Your explanation of the Multiverse theory is the sort of thing that would sound good in spoken language but is hard to write like that. It feels stilted, almost bullet point-like. Take another stab at that one I think.<br/>"They are aged" is still odd.<br/>Ahh, hundreds of years, okay. Actually, the insertion of the phrase where it is actually clears up another issue from the previous draft I forgot to mention and was gonna include here - no need now I guess!<br/>I approve of having examples (and Nostalgia is a GREAT artifact btw) but I think you might want to move them into the Gear chapter and just have a page reference here, try to keep the flow of thought going with the world. System and numbers can come later, plus putting things together makes it easier to find them when flipping through the text.<br/>In the last paragraph, "...in technology and <b>has</b> their great cities." This is a past tense sentence with a present tense word improperly in it. Easy typo.<br/><br/>THERE WE GO! That was good description. I wasn't expecting an example story, but that works for sure. I like it, it's good, this is good.<br/>I <i>would</i> still call out in the "think of the most disturbing things" bit that you should try to incorporate your players's phobias. It's pretty clear, but I would still say it to be explicit about it. <br/>The word "venturers" at the top is kinda weird. I mean, it works, but it's an odd word to pick.<br/>Actually, I'm going to say that you should remove the "For some reason" bit from what to do if you go to the Abyss. It's superfluous, and makes it sound like you don't actually intend for players to go there, which is pretty obviously untrue - you NAMED the game Abyss after all.<br/><br/>Still axe the (wink, wink). I just call it bad writing that doesn't gel with the tone of the whole text.<br/>"But even that couldn't stop them." Okay, I see what you're going for now. Unfortunately, you really need to call out who "Them" is. From my reading, it's the Purgers. But it's not quite clear. Even just making it "But even that couldn't stop the Purgers" is perfectly good.<br/><br/>Attracted to the word Theocracy, aren't ya? It works, but I'd call it a religion myself. Regardless, drop the capitalization.<br/>Is "tyrannic" even a word? Oppressive, or a stronger synonym, would do fine.<br/>Yup, this page is pretty good.<br/><br/>Ah, so Hosts ARE Incumancers! My question would be: Why? What are you really getting out of having two words for essentially the same thing? At best, you have two phrases. At worst, players are totally confused. My guess at your intentions is that there's no real word for "using a Daemon's power" that connect to the word Host, you would seemingly need to make up a word. And to that, I answer: Why do you need a word at all? People can just say that they're using their Daemon's power. If most Hosts are Incumancers, just call 'em Hosts.<br/>Of course, maybe you just want to use the word cuz it's a cool word. That's fine - just make sure you know what it does to the text.<br/><br/>The "Choose A Backstory" step might need some more fleshing out. Some players like coming up with these beforehand, but not everyone's so great at that. Some clear prompts could really help. For examples of some great prompting for backstory, check out the Phase Aspects section of The Dresden Files RPG and presumably other FATE games (you can get the new FATE Core draft for just 1 dollar on Kickstarter right now). Another fantastic one comes again from Don't Rest Your Head, which I feel has a lot of thematic line-ups with your games (though the premises and systems are radically different).<br/><br/>Phobia list looks fully useful now. I recommend some sort of guideline on "When you choose to write your own Skill/Phobia, here's some tips on picking one that will be useful."<br/><br/>Not gonna hit on the rest of the book. I flipped through and by-and-large the problems are only potential numbers ones that will be aided far more by any playtesting than by my just reading it.<br/><br/>There, that's it for now. THESE don't feel like they're getting too much shorter, but your draft is definitely refining its way down. If you've got any chances to play, I'd recommend trying now. You have a functional game, and while it could probably use even more writing and numbers refinement, it's in a state I would be confident passing to my players.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the next draft!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Foroth" title="Foroth"><img alt="Foroth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Foroth">Foroth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403482/#Comment_403482" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T15:18:48+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  3:18PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

I'd be interested to hear how that has gone. Sometimes some folks don't like to playtest games that have been put online if the creator hasn't even playtested them. I understand it can be hard to get a group together, if that's a difficulty for you. But, bluntly speaking (and I say this with all the love in my heart for your game &amp; with the hopes that you finish it): If you haven't been able to focus the time and energy to playtest your own game, how do you expect other people to?<br/><br/>Just something to think about. Not trying to spit in your eye, but maybe encourage with some tough questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407775/#Comment_407775" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T03:38:39+00:00" title="March  2, 2013  3:38AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aye, that's pretty accurate.<br/><br/>On another side, I'd love to playtest your game, but my group and I are actively embroiled in other things and aren't in a place to put new games on the roster quite yet. That said, if you're having a hard time finding a local group, consider scheduling some online gaming through Google+ Hangouts with some folks. Ask around, there's a pretty active RPG community on G+, I'm sure you'll be able to scrounge together the 2 or 3 extra people (on top of myself <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/>) who'd be up for trying it. It's a bit odd at first, but it's fun and functional.<br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to go through the latest draft in depth - in general, it's pretty good. Figure I'll leave you with a couple of questions though:<br/>* How does your game handle different lengths of campaigns? Is it meant for longer-form games or one-shots? I'm sure it can do both, but do you expect it to shine better one way or another?<br/>* What's your player range? Do you have a general minimum (can it handle 1 GM/1 Player?)? How about a maximum (does it break down some when you play with a lot of people?)?<br/>* Describe the type of tone you expect to deliver with the game. Are there certain parts of the game world you want to accentuate? It's obviously aimed to hit some horror things (through Phobias and the Abyss), and the theme of fighting to survive is pretty clear. But what else? Is it meant to be about exploring the world and a sense of wonder, or perhaps that general almost-dungeon-crawl-esque feel that seems to be the basis of the sample adventure?<br/><br/>Chances are, it's capable of all of these things. Ultimately that's up to the individual groups. I'm more interested in if you have specific intentions with the game that you can write directly to. And some of this, like the actual truth of your player range or campaign length, you likely won't know til you've played some, but knowing what you're trying to go for can help guide that. Knowing your intent is what I'm getting at here - and that might just be me interested, I love knowing intent personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
