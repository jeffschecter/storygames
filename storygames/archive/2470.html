                    So, <i>Misery Bubblegum's</i> core mechanic is that you give someone else an opinion ("You are cool!") and that helps them when they are living up to that opinion (i.e. the other player gets to roll your dice (and then return them to you!) when they act "cool").<br/>
<br/>
Over in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2426&amp;page=1#Item_36" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> we talked a lot about why you would want to <b>reject</b> other people's opinions of you.  I want that to be a meaningful choice, to drive a second angst-and-suffering economy that will inform and enliven the opinion economy.<br/>
<br/>
Much of what that other thread boiled down to is that some opinions are hard to live up to ("You're an honest, decent guy") and some of them you don't <b>want</b> to live up to ("You're a trouble-maker, just like your father was").  But as the rules stand, it's always the players choice whether to use any opinion or not.  So  the mechanics aren't yet driving the choices that indirectly sustain the <i>later</i> choices.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm thinking, right now, is that one of the outcomes of conflict resolution is that a player can lose or regain the ability to <i>use</i> one of the opinions on her character.  So, like, if someone has given me the "Cool" opinion, one of the outcomes of the conflict resolution could give someone the right to block that ... I can still act "cool," but I can't spend the dice on that opinion, which means that (a) I don't get any advantage from being "cool", (b) the player who awarded me the "cool" opinion doesn't get their dice back and (c) that player cannot increase their "cool" opinion of my character to higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
I <b>think</b> that roughly corresponds to the "coolness" being just shallow, surface posturing rather than something more.  And I'll admit that I sort of like the idea that external events can result in people being unable to truly address opinions.  Like, if your little kid sister thinks you're incredibly cool, but then you lose the one-on-one basketball game then maybe you just can't <b>feel that</b> any more ... and so her faith, be it ever so pure, becomes powerless to help you until some other external conflict unlocks your hangup.<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound like it would make sense with the way people actually act?  Does this sound like the kind of thing that people do and feel?  Or is there some <i>other</i> way that people become unable to live up to the expectations of others?                </div>

                            In the context of a game which deals with self-doubt and self-discovery, it's perfectly sensible.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a counterpoint to this would be that certain characters (I'm mainly thinking older characters) to have some "reinforced" opinions that cannot be blocked.<br/>
<br/>
For example: It doesn't matter what you do to Dr Jones, you cannot block his self-opinion that "you're a really clever guy". But his "chicks dig you" opinion is far more fragile. (Unless we're talking about Dr Henry "Indiana" Jones, of course.)                        </div>

                            Something I pulled out of my hat? I'm trying to refer to the fact that "you're a clever guy" is an opinion referring to Dr Jones and not something he's given to someone else. So anyone could have put that on his sheet way back when. However, he has now embraced that opinion as fact, which is why it can't be taken away from him.<br/>

                            Oh, see, now I'm going to have to go back and watch <i>Last Crusade</i>.  Not a hardship, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
And <b>why</b> do I need to watch it again?  Because I want to see if anyone ever expresses the idea that Indy is clever or cool or buff.  I know for damn sure that people do express the opinion that "chicks dig him," only to later revoke that opinion.  I can remember those scenes.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the rooted self-opinions you're talking about are just the character-traits I was talking about in the previous thread.  Those are the things that the character can load up with <i>their own dice</i> at the beginning of the game.  The moment of angsty-crisis is the moment when Indy voluntarily loses access to those, in exchange for being able to load his own dice onto the opinions other people offer him.  In the movie, one such crisis is (transparently) when his father gets shot.  He goes from being Indy the rugged adventurer to being Junior the good student, in an instant.  That's (IMHO) the whole point of that wonderful scene with Indy walking through traps while reading out of the death-trap cliff-notes of his father's journal.  He's saved by the study and the faith that his father thinks are the best parts of him.                        </div>

                            So, does that mean that other players can mess with your characters opinions, but you are the only one that can mess with your own traits? If so, I'd buy that.<br/>

Does this help answer your original questions, or do you want to explore anything in more detail? It's your call, I think.                        </div>

                            Well, I'm trying to figure out under what circumstances an opinion should get locked or unlocked (or, conversely, since players are doing all this stuff ... what a player should have to do/achieve in order to lock or unlock an opinion).<br/>
<br/>
I've already got this "thing" hanging about in my game, where the system provides two results:  Victory (which you achieve by having more dice of any color on your side) and That Other Thing (which you achieve by giving away a lot of your dice as opinion, and having them rolled in a conflict).<br/>
<br/>
If the person whose <i>opinions</i> made the most impact on the conflict (not their traits, just the opinions they gave to others which those others chose to use) gets the right to decide an opinion to lock or unlock, does that make story-sense?<br/>
<br/>
I can totally see it in <b>some</b> of the source material.  Like, in <i>Oh My Goddess</i>?  Belldandy almost never wins conflicts.  That's just not her way.  But her <i>opinions</i> on people are invariably at the center of everything going on.  This ability to shut down or open up people's ability to cope with what folks think of them ... that seems very much like the type of meta-story influence that she has in the series.<br/>
<br/>
In other places, it's not so clear to me.  Maybe I need a playtest.                        </div>

                            Re: conflicts. Remember the important thing about them is what's at stake. So, if an opinion is what's at stake, someone can win the conflict even if they don't "succeed in life".<br/>
<br/>
Does your game allow only opinion conflicts ("what's at stake is whether or not you're a cool dude") or does it also allow for more standard conflicts ("what's at stake is whether or not you steal the principal's lunchbox without getting caught".) Or are you trying to resolve both at once? Having two independent things at stake that resolve at the same time may be the reason for the confusion.                        </div>

                            It may well be the reason for the confusion, but I think that having both <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i> goals at stake in the same conflict is essential to drama.<br/>
<br/>
If I just have a conflict about "What's at stake is whether or not you're a cool dude," then how does the audience ever see that happening?  If, contrariwise, I have the character trying to face up to the school bully, despite being a 98-pound weakling, that acts as a great big amplifier for all their internal issues.  It makes them perceptible to the audience.                        </div>

                            I'm not saying that having two simultaneous stakes is bad, not at all. It's more like, when you said earlier that Belldandy doesn't win any conflicts - I'm thinking, maybe she's winning the "opinion" half of the conflicts, but not the other half. That's part of the confusing bit. Sorry if I'm making a hash of explaining this in writing.                        </div>

This would suggest a notion of "coolness" as something predicated on those other people being "not cool," like you'd be diluting your "cool" by sharing it with those "hangers on" or something.
