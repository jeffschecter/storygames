I've been approved to separate early from the Air Force, something I thought would be a longshot, even with my career field being as overmanned as it is.  It's great news for me, because it means I can start going to college this fall.  But it also means I have a very short time to figure out exactly what degree I want to pursue.  I'd like to learn everything about everything; unfortunately, I can't just pick interesting courses as I discover them -- the GI Bill pays for only the courses that are absolutely required for my degree.  Moreover, I've already completed all of the General Education requirements I'll ever need, so I'll pretty much just have degree-specific electives to work with.<br/><br/>My question for you all is, which degree program do you think would be the <i>most</i> applicable to the study of storygaming?<br/><br/>So many academic fields can be related to storygaming -- psychology, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, and various arts, just to name a few.  Of course, there are also hybrids and offshoots of those fields.  For example, I was looking into Cognitive Science (tending more towards psychological and philosophical aspects), but the few colleges that offer that program are too expensive (i.e., out-of-state).<br/><br/>To sum up: of the most-every-university-has-it degree programs, which ones do you think relate most to how storygaming happens, and how it happens successfully?<br/><br/>(Note: For any of you who are perplexed at my decision-making process, storygame applicability isn't my <i>only</i> criteria for choosing a degree.  But it is the the one I feel most excited about.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Katie Salen, who edited <i>Rules of Play</i>, currently runs the <a href="http://www.parsons.edu/departments/dept.aspx?dID=69&amp;sdID=91" rel="nofollow">Design &amp; Technology Program at the Parson's School For Design</a>. There are also other programs at MIT, Tempere (FInland), and other places that specialize in game studies.  Actually, check out <a href="http://www.igda.org/articles/msakey_gdc-curriculum.php" rel="nofollow">this report</a> from a conference in which some of the big names in the field discussed the state of academic education in game studies.  I'd honestly just seek out academic game studies papers, read a bunch of them, decide which professors you really dig, and see if you can work with one of them.<br/><br/>Of course, it's also possible to do game studies from within another discipline, like many of the ones mentioned here (anthro, comm studies, sociology, literature, performance studies, etc.).  There too, though, it's important that the professors that you'd be working with are supportive of the idea of studying games and, better still, understand enough about games that they can give you the help you need.  I've read a bunch of MA theses on roleplaying that were very disappointing, largely because (so I suspect) the advising professors didn't know anything about the topic and just let the student write whatever they wanted.  That's not a good method for developing rigorous, awesome work on roleplaying in the academic community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68808/#Comment_68808" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T14:32:04+00:00" title="May 13, 2007  2:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon maintains close ties with the drama department there; I'm thinking that might actually be perfect for story gaming projects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68815/#Comment_68815" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T15:18:58+00:00" title="May 13, 2007  3:18PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coincidentally, the academic MMORG studies blog <i>Terra Nova</i> had a very similar discussion happening there a couple days ago.

Economics. <br/><br/>A big part of Econ is game theory. Who-will-do-what-because-it-is-most-benificial-to-them is a really major principal, and major source of discourse. The film "a beautiful mind" is all about a guy who came up with some of economics most important gamist principles. <br/><br/>Also, from the production end, an understanding of business model, distro, prodution that would be learned from an economics degree would prove invaluable. <br/><br/>Finally the organiziation of ideas, materials and how those things will interact with each other is a big part of economics that directly corolates to game creation and understanding. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is a bit of de-humanized approach to the hobby (moreso than would be an education in Sociology, Anthro, Linguistics, or Psych), but it's one that i don't think enough of us really have, and it would help a lot. Also, it has some real-world use outside of gaming (economics, who would have thought).<br/><br/>NOTE: i went to art school for advertising and graphic design.
