Mad shit.  In space.  Like a gonzo Doctor Who, but who rides a space chopper instead of a police box and carries a massive sword instead of a screwdriver.  He fights space barbarians who ride star dragons. Illustrated by Simon Bisley with a soundtrack by Judas Priest.  Foreword by Michael Moorcock and Lemmy.<br/><br/>The nearest thing I can think of (not counting the mediocre but beautiful Metabarons RPG) is to take Octane and put that in space instead of post appoc America.<br/><br/>Any other game I ought to take a look at before I think any further on this?  Or do I just break out the complete Rob Halford and work from there?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100388/#Comment_100388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T05:10:14+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  5:10AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Parts of Dictionary of Mu capture this (space pyramid powered by blood!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100389/#Comment_100389" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T05:20:46+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  5:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff Diamond's underappreciated <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10058.phtml" rel="nofollow">Orbit</a> qualifies as utterly mad shit in space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100392/#Comment_100392" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T05:46:41+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  5:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Jeff Diamond's underappreciated<a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10058.phtml" rel="nofollow">Orbit</a>qualifies as utterly mad shit in space.</blockquote>I have a copy of Orbit.

This is what the Metabarons (a universe of crazy shit) is like. The true Metabarons RPG would look like this:<br/><br/>1: Sit in a coffee house.<br/>2: Take two hits of acid.<br/>3: Start talking.<br/>4: Roll a 1d20: Whoever gets the highest number gets to narrate for three minutes. Then roll again.<br/>5: End abruptly.<br/><br/>At the very least, it would look like TOON with Character Death.<br/><br/>It's something that I can recognize as a genre, but that I otherwise want to totally stay away from.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steven" title="Steven"><img alt="Steven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://sjhhanlon.wordpress.com/files/2007/10/tinyphoto.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steven">Steven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100398/#Comment_100398" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T06:15:54+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  6:15AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone ever read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.R._and_Quinch" rel="nofollow">DR and Quinch</a>? It was a reasonably early piece of work by Alan Moore and appeared in the British comic 2000AD.

The point is that while there is a load of mad shit going on, there is alway a central conflict which is coherent.

Over the past couple of weeks, I had been putting together a Star Wars Luchadore octaNe playset, and keep looking at it thinking "This is going to be bat-shit weird!" and I find myself seriously considering getting a new luchadore mask from the local Halloween store to wear when we finally play it. Just to ensure that everyone KNOWS we're going for bat-shit weirdness.<br/><br/>That, or playing Pocket Danger Patrol as a drinking game.<br/>...with Jenga blocks and strippers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395094/#Comment_395094" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T22:12:08+00:00" title="October 27, 2012 10:12PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2012 10:32PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have two different answers to this dilemma, one based on form and another on substance.<br/><br/>The easier way is to play Torg, with every cosm as fair game for character creation. In fact, requiring that everyone come from a different cosm is probably key.  There actually is a space opera cosm that was added late in the game's life, which is a good starting point, but letting flying psychic starfish, jut-jawed two-fisted archeologists, cyberCatholics and free-market capitalist ninja clans run amuck in it is what adds the proper fever-dream flavor.<br/><br/>The harder but I think more spiritually faithful way is to play <a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/2009/09/a-small-gift-to-my-readers/" rel="nofollow">WTF</a> (<a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/2009/09/that-languidly-dreamt-raif-a-supplement-for-wtf/" rel="nofollow">TLDR</a> optional) and gently reskin everything as taking place on different planets and in the deeps between the stars, because in that Jodorowsky-influenced school of beautiful space madness there's always a lot of Jungian shit going on so the pilgrim's-progress premise of WTF will honor that beating heart of crazy.  Plus the players arguing out of character about how to define the rules they're playing by and even being able to roll to depose the GM and elect a new one provides a straight-edge alternative to Andy's timeless resolution mechanic above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395298/#Comment_395298" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T13:37:50+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  1:37PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Please tell me more about Star Wars Lucha Libre.

I had to fill in a few gaps (there was no image for Juan Uno, and they didn't have a name for the Mexican version of Obi-Wan...so of course he would be played by Ricardo Montalban).<br/><br/>...and then I had to draw everyone. Of course.<br/><br/>Haven't had a chance to play it yet, because things just keep getting in the way. But <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B5K_Bqfr0dqcSVVObkRoTXRuQkE" rel="nofollow">here is the link</a> to the main parts of the character playsheets. It leaves out everything about the rules tweaks, since I don't want to distribute the main rules for octaNe anywhere. But SHOULD you be interested, and have a copy of octaNe, I could briefly explain what the tweaks are in a whisper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
