We had three players: Noam, Kathy, and myself.  Noam was taking the lead in organizing, and Kathy had played before, while I was a complete newcomer. We used the <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/#playset" rel="nofollow"><b>Flyover playset</b></a>.  We had left unspecified where we were, just somewhere in very small town middle America.  The brief version was that it turned into a family drama gone bad from drugs.  What we knew from the setup was that:<br/><br/>* My char and Noam's char's Relationship was "marijuana supplier and dealer", and our Need was "To Get In...trouble like you used to"<br/>* Kathy's char and my char's Relationship was "Parent and son/daughter-in-law", and had an Object of "Printouts of an Internet conversation."<br/>* Kathy's char and Noam's char's Relationship was "Church friends", and had a Location of "A six-bedroom house with swimming pool."<br/><br/>There may have been something else that I forgot.  From this we developed that I played a 50-ish named Rachel who had walked out on her son, but now comes to visit him regularly from her home in Mexico - she was a rich, fashionable, tough new grandmother.  Noam played Clemson, who was Rachel's local dealer and an old high school friend of hers who just found out that he had a terminal illness.  Kathy was playing Sadie, mother of two young children with Rachel's son Daniel.  Basically, it was only the first two lines that drove play - the church friends and house didn't really come in, and the printouts were relatively minor since the same information came through another channel.  Our later Twist specifiers were "Love rears its ugly head" and "A Showdown."  <br/><br/>In general, my thoughts were: <br/><br/>1) The mechanics take much more of a back seat than I expected.  Instead, the mechanics only come up once a scene, and they are (a) pretty quick, and (b) non-specific in what they require.  It is more like a Jeepform or freeform game, it seemed to me.  Most of the mechanic results were very open (i.e. "Love rears its ugly head"), so they were mostly vague pointers.  By comparison, say, 1001 Nights has a lot of dice being put out on the table, rolled and passed during each story.  <br/><br/>2) Noam said that our game was on the more serious side compared to the other sessions he'd had of Fiasco, which tended to have more humor and/or wackiness - i.e. Ours was more "A Simple Plan" than "Fargo."  I'm not sure what drove this, not having played in the other more wacky sessions.  <br/><br/>3) I had misunderstood how "Resolve a Scene" worked - and it ended up that I think we never used it (or if we did it was only once).  That was just a simple miscommunication, but since maybe others might have the same thing, I'll mention it.  I heard the mechanic as you either Establish a Scene or Resolve a Scene on your turn, which for a time lead me to think that you could leave a scene unresolved and/or resolve a scene established earlier.  I eventually got this, but for whatever reason it took me a while.  <br/><br/>4) With a fixed and limited number of scenes to get through the plot with, I felt like I couldn't have small scenes - like just two guys chatting during a long car drive, or a husband and wife talking over their finances.  Also, those scenes seem even harder to define success and failure for.  At one point I started to establish such a scene, and then I revised it and jumped into a more meaty plot scene.  It worked without them, but they seem like something that could be good to add - perhaps as an optional rule.  <br/><br/>5) One of the interesting points was that we had established Rachel's son and Sadie's husband as Daniel, and he was being set up as a major character.  Noam brought him in as the new partner of Clem.  Kathy didn't want to play him in that scene since she didn't have a picture of how he was there and she was playing his wife.  Since we had trouble with this, I suggested that the thing to do was to kill him - which I did in my scene.  <br/><br/>Highlights of the game for me: <br/><br/>* Kathy perfectly described the steely motherly gaze of disapproval that I was thinking of, as Rachel watched Daniel walk away from their drug meeting.  <br/><br/>* Clem considers killing himself, when we flash back to him and Rachel in high school stealing a cash box at a carnival, more for the fun than for the money. <br/><br/>* Sadie and her husband Daniel decide to rob Daniel's mother Rachel of her drugs and/or drug money.  However, Rachel fires at the two figures in masks and kills her son Daniel. <br/><br/>* Rachel forgives Sadie, and lets her keep the money to take care of the grandkids.  However, she sets out to kill Clem to tie up loose ends so nothing leads back to her grandkids.  <br/><br/>* Rachel and Clem face off with guns on each other outside of Clem's home that Rachel set on fire.  Clem says its not his fault, and Rachel informs him "But Clem, it is all your fault.  ...  Daniel was your son."  Clem is shocked and hesitates, and Rachel shoots him and leaves him for dead.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289628/#Comment_289628" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T14:40:24+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  2:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was great playing with both of you!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what happened in the aftermath.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadie and the kids end up on the run.

I remember, once, being sort of bemused by the Jeep people's use of the phrase "structured freeform", but that's just what Fiasco is, right? You get a structure to hang your (largely) freeform scenes on, one that provides you with a tense initial situation and a good amount of pacing help. Then you go into a scene and it gets all Danish.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>* Rachel and Clem face off with guns on each other outside of Clem's home that Rachel set on fire.  Clem says its not his fault, and Rachel informs him "But Clem, it is all your fault.  ...  Daniel was your son."  Clem is shocked and hesitates, and Rachel shoots him and leaves him for dead.</blockquote> Oh, Fiasco, what won't you do for love?<br/><br/>It sounds like the Table 1 Fiasco was most righteous. I just started writing up the AP of our session at Table 0, using the Lynchian "Manna Hotel" playset, and it's already too long to post but too weird not to try to salvage. We came up with so many note-perfect details that I don't know what to cut. It was the perfect serial-murdering-identical-septuplet, occult-conspiracy-power-company-badger, cokehead-victim-zombie storm, and the  thing is that for the most part, and especially at the end, it was more eerie than wacky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
