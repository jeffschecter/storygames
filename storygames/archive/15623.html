It's pitched as the game of HBO's <i>Rome</i> series, complete with all the sex, violence, and intrigue. As the name suggests, it's set during the reign of the mad Emperor Nero. It'll also be completely mundane, with no superpowers or anything similar. <br/><br/>I've written up details of chargen on <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Nero" rel="nofollow">the Nero page</a>, if anyone wants a look. It's got new Lifepaths and Distinctions, suitable for the game.<br/><br/>If you have suggestions on how to improve things, please dive in! In particular, some of the new Distinctions could do with improvement.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354141/#Comment_354141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T06:19:56+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  6:19AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really awesome!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354264/#Comment_354264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T16:23:32+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  4:23PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!

(We had a bit of a rocky start with PCs that their players didn't like, and a lack of interaction between them, but that seems to have resolved itself now.) Last night featured an epic fight between two large groups of legionaries. It started off as a complication and was quickly resolved as another complication. I'm glad to say that the skirmish didn't detract from the main event, a discussion between Lucidus and Julia, his impetuous 16 year old sister-in-law who fancies the pants off him and who just tried to kill Nero's latest wife. In a later scene, we discovered the need for a new Distinction, "***k like your life depends on it" as Drucilla convinced Nero that Vitus really was a Christian traitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nVitus and Vebis reconciled their differences (Vitus had previously disowned Vebuis) and then staged a coup against Nero. Things didn't quite go to plan, with Nero escaping, Lucidus (a Nero loyalist) captured by Vebius, and Vitus mostly kidnapped by Drucilla.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365643/#Comment_365643" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T05:13:00+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  5:13AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2012 5:18AM by James_Mullen.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the new Distinction needs a broader remit, so perhaps this:<br/>\n<b>Take One for the Team</b><br/>\nSometimes you need to get your hands dirty; sometimes, you just need to get dirty.
