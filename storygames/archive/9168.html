I've used InDesign occasionally, mostly for projects related to boardgames. Most of my income comes from layout and design projects nowadays, so I have to spend more time on this stuff than I'd want to.<br/><br/>My every impression is that QuarkXPress is a largely antiquated piece of software. I'd design a better one myself; the legacy functionality, conservative development and unwillingness to advance makes Quark more useless every day. The background on MacIntosh is a burden every day for a Windows user in small, yet concrete ways. The quirks of the program are irrational and need to be learned, the holes in its feature-set hard to justify in this day and age. The only reason it's still used at all is the relatively high immediate overhead in training and licenses, which is not necessary for those of us who've already invested the time and money into learning Quark. I imagine that the suits out there in Quarkland think more in terms of how long they can string the same codebase along than in terms of real future development. Especially European newspapers and other entrenched design organizations are often very deeply committed to a personalized, Quark-based workflow that has taken the organization quite a while to master; I fully understand the decision to stay with a slightly inferior product in these conditions.<br/><br/>My impression and experience of InDesign is that it beats Quark in nine out of ten feature comparisons. The features that it loses in are useful for certain workflows and purposes that a casual user will never, ever have to worry his head about. The suite is an additional advantage for the casual user: if you have the money to burn, there's no reason on this earth not to buy the whole suite, learn to use it and work with the best professional tools available in the field of layout and design today. My experiences with InDesign are not without frustration, but I'm smart enough to know when my frustration is because of my own expectations and when it's the fault of the program. Even when it's the program that's at fault, I just need to remember how happy I am every time Quark crashes due to an imagined Mac/Windows incompatibility, a corrupted file or just for kicks, and suddenly it doesn't seem so bad if InDesign can be a bit counter-intuitive in how it applies language specs to paragraphs.<br/><br/>(We should note here that if it's not readily apparent from the above, I'm not too happy with the current DTP paradigm in general - InDesign is just miles better in implementing this flawed beast than Quark. In truth it's completely ridiculous that DTP has yet to make a move to total semantic description of content with dynamic content generation and separate styling. What is a world where some random coders making web programming paradigms outdesign the whole field of traditional publishing industry? Heck, when Microsoft Word outperforms your feature set, perhaps it's a time to look in the mirror, don't you think? As far as I'm concerned, I'll drop both InDesign and Quark the second anybody comes out with a complete DTP implementation based on something like the xml/css paradigm that is widely used in web content services.)<br/><br/>If you have experience with other Adobe software, such as Photoshop, then that's a definite plus in casual use - it's almost certain that you'll find InDesign easier to learn and train to a level where you can get things done effectively. If you get heavy in layout, you'll be wanting to get some sort of vector drawing programs, bitmap drawing programs and whatnot; this whole workflow is already designed for the InDesign user in the form of the suite, while a Quark user will have to pick and choose his software and design his own workflow from the ground up. Not necessarily a drawback, of course - I haven't used InDesign in enough depth to really comment on the default workflow and how easy it is to introduce third-party components into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202807/#Comment_202807" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T14:58:00+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  2:58PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quark Schmark.

InDesign excells at this.<br/><br/>You can get the better of two (or three, or four...) worlds. You can manipulate, create or adjust your images, charts, graphics, logos, text editing and stuff in other software (better designed for doing just that), then export it and blend it smoothly at InDesign. So you can get the best quality and adaptability there is, as long as you are comfortable working with several software at the same time. Of course (and quite understandable), Adobe software is the best one for this stuff.<br/><br/>And the style sheets are nice and cool, and (trust me on this one) they save you so much time you'll be spending your time at embelishing your design in no time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202817/#Comment_202817" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T16:01:39+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  4:01PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditto everything everyone else said.

If you're messing with vector-y art, it's Illustrator (Flash can also do vector-y stuff, but that's arguably not what it's designed for).  InDesign can do a lot of cool vector-y stuff that Illustrator does, but annoyingly it cannot edit .AI or other vector-y image files.  <br/><br/>The only bad thing about the packages is that they try to include a lot of shit that you may not really need, which allows them to jack the price up on you.  Honestly, I would start by downloading trial versions of everything you think you might want to use and play with them for 30 days to figure out their limitations.

Ancient software, crappy business transactions and bundles. Like, the US version we're like "OMG it costs a few hundred bucks". Thing is, for things like Asian languages, here's what the world looked like about 5 years ago (let's take Japanese):<br/><br/>Quark: Simply cannot render Asian characters without purchasing the Asian Language Version of the software. The software suite that ran about $1000 in the US per license is about $3,000 per license in Japan. And it is *impossible* to run the English version on Japanese PCs. It wouldn't load, or if you hacked it to load, it would not recognize UTF-8/international characters.<br/><br/>Around the same time, InDesign was beginning to be recognized on its strengths in professional organizations. Plus, the price was only a few hundred for the US version. The Japanese version is around 1K (and this is nothing more than "The US version, but the menus all written in Japanese for the Japanese consumer).<br/>But the magic: The US version has no problems at all with international/asian fonts. And loads fine on non-English OSes. So if someone could deal with the English menus, they could still purchase the cheaper one and use it without problems.<br/><br/>My software radar is always locked to "international language/region compatibility", and in that realm Quark basically gave the middle finger to everyone, with an attitude of "Hah, like you have a choice?"<br/><br/>Now that we actually have a choice, Quark's business practices, not to mention the software itself, looks like a dinosaur.<br/><br/>Of course, the only strike against InDesign is Adobe's "New Version every 1-2 years" (rather than releasing the new features as upgradable content) syndrome. <br/><br/>This has nothing to do with InDesign as a tool, mind. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202860/#Comment_202860" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T19:34:09+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  7:34PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what I'm picking up is this:<br/><br/>Adobe InDesign is a professional and useful piece of layout software.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(cheese)" rel="nofollow">Quark is a kind of cheese</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202862/#Comment_202862" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T20:03:55+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  8:03PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless I misremember, InDesign didn't have Nordic language support a couple of years ago, while Quark has had it since the early '90s.

A real layout software allows you to define your own text boxes and have text flow from box to box the way you want it to. Word can hack things with text frames, but it's clumsy and slow, and can't flow the text from box to box. Word might or might not have appropriate typography-related features - I've never looked at reams of Word text with a critical eye to really find out how it deals with automatic hyphenation, ligatures, whitespace in justified text, em spaces and other such details of fine typography. Word might or might not handle images in technically acceptable ways - I understand that it can't really use image data without internally transforming it into some sort of jpeg format or something, which is a problem; of course it can't take postscript files at all, which is likewise a big issue for most layout workflows. A seemingly minor but actually crucial thing Word is weak with is positioning elements - the tools for that are much slower and less exact than what you'd get in a layout program. Word also misses some detail elements that are taken for granted in layout work, but which might or might not be a problem for a given project - an example of such are the relatively limited tools Word has for defining image embedding envelopes (the area around which text flows when an image is embedded in text). Word has many lacks in things like this which won't really bother you until you need them.<br/><br/>Word as a layout software will also have plenty of feature bloat (just like it does as a text editor) and non-streamlined ways of doing things; a layout program is optimized for the things you mostly do in layout, such as style control, master page control and flowing text vs. images in different ways, all of which can be done in Word, but it's somewhat more clumsy than even Quark makes it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Word is more sophisticated than Quark in the way it handles glyph control, automation, dynamic content, footnotes and image embedding options (when it works; Word is somewhat unreliable here), which is totally ridiculous - how is it possible for a <i>text editor</i> to beat a supposedly professional software in these areas? It's quite a rude awakening when you learn to use something like Quark and find out that yes, you're going to have to create, position and update your footnotes by hand, as the venerable programmers of the said software have never heard of dynamic content control.<br/><br/>I would only recommend Word as the layout program for a completely low-performance project, for a person who has no interest in investing in another program but doesn't mind learning to make Word do tricks. It is no more difficult to learn to use a real layout program, so if you're going to do several projects and can afford a layout program, it will improve your work by encouraging correct methods over the somewhat angular ways Word does things. On the other hand, Word is actually noticeably superior to layout programs when it comes to simple, text-intensive, short layouts which don't require powerful master page features and don't have so many elements as to make you insane trying to position them exactly. I, for example, choose Word over a layout program when I need to write and print an essay of some sort with captions and images, but nothing more complex. Basically, anything primarily text-based and intended for the home printer can probably be done with Word better than in a layout program.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202882/#Comment_202882" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T03:42:02+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  3:42AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian:<br/><br/>Why not just find someone with InDesign who would be happy to help?

They completely rewrote the rendering software in 7, and redesigned the UI in 8.  Also they've gotten much much better about tech support and flexible licensing.  They've also started to release new versions more often (every 1-2 years or so) and have added free major patches with occasioinal new functionality and bugfixes in the interim.  (6.5 was a big example of this. others haven't been as major that I've noticed, but they've always been nice.)<br/><br/>They never would have done any of this without inDesign kicking their asses for a few years, but I'd say they now have similar feature sets.

I am pretty close to getting a friend to get me a student version of CS4.<br/><br/>For most projects at my skill level (middling to none), Word is fine. As I teach myself more about layout, I find Word increasingly frustrating. Here's some reasons why.\n<ol>\n<li>Line spacing. I can set line spacing at 1x, 2x, and 1.5x line height. If I want to do, say, 140%, I can't do that.</li>\n<li>Image placement is tedious. I paste in an image, wrap a text box around it, resize and fiddle with settings. It takes a while and often it doesn't want to go where I want it.</li>\n<li>Any regions I want to define are going to be rectangular because of the nature of text boxes. Like, if I wanted to add a red circle in the middle of the page and overlap text, and have the text change go white over the circle, I just could not do that. I can't have irregular-shaped images and let the text wrap around them.</li>\n<li>There aren't any tools for computing or displaying grids. I have to do all that outside, old-school, and then set margins and columns up manually. It's really difficult to align to a horizontal grid (in rows) without using tables and tables suck ass.</li>\n<li>Spacing between paragraphs is often frustrating. Either I set each one manually or I leave it on Auto and hope it does something intelligent. Often, at the tops of pages, it decides to add space before headers.

I am pretty close to getting a friend to get me a student version of CS4.<br/><br/>For most projects at my skill level (middling to none), Word is fine. As I teach myself more about layout, I find Word increasingly frustrating. Here's some reasons why.<br/><br/><br/>Line spacing. I can set line spacing at 1x, 2x, and 1.5x line height. If I want to do, say, 140%, I can't do that.<br/>Image placement is tedious. I paste in an image, wrap a text box around it, resize and fiddle with settings. It takes a while and often it doesn't want to go where I want it.<br/>Any regions I want to define are going to be rectangular because of the nature of text boxes. Like, if I wanted to add a red circle in the middle of the page and overlap text, and have the text change go white over the circle, I just could not do that. I can't have irregular-shaped images and let the text wrap around them.<br/>There aren't any tools for computing or displaying grids. I have to do all that outside, old-school, and then set margins and columns up manually. It's really difficult to align to a horizontal grid (in rows) without using tables and tables suck ass.<br/>Spacing between paragraphs is often frustrating. Either I set each one manually or I leave it on Auto and hope it does something intelligent. Often, at the tops of pages, it decides to add space before headers. I remove those manually.<br/></blockquote>\nThis 5 problems can be easily solved using <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenOffice</a><br/>I've made the pdf layout for various italian traslation of free rpgs with free software like openoffice, inkscape, gimp and pdftk, and it was more simple obtain the desired layout with openoffice than using word.<br/>It can be a mess with huge or press projects, for example, it was a bit messy with the layout of the Italian translation of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8263&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202969/#Comment_202969" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T10:31:06+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 10:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which component of OpenOffice solves these?

See? <br/><br/>Thanks! I've gotten kinda good at layout tricks in Word, for what it's worth. \n<blockquote>Word might not be the best out there for design (and remember, these days I'm totally digging into learning InDesign), but it can do really slick things without having to learn an entirely new interface, workflow, methodology and terminology.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely. Most things that look awful, look awful because the designer doesn't understand design, not because of the tool. I understand the rudiments of design and can create stuff that doesn't look awful. Is it harder to do this in Word than in InDesign? Yeah, probably a lot harder, but really it wasn't that bad. <br/><br/>Here are my tips for getting the most out of your layout and design in Word.\n<ol>\n<li>Absolutely make the most of styles. Learn them. Live them.</li>\n<li>Word is stingy on outer white space. Increase your margins (especially the top and bottom). Increase line spacing (second tab in Paragraph) to 1.5x for text that breathes better.</li>\n<li>Word is overgenerous with inner white space. Decrease gutters between columns. You don't need much, especially when your text is left-justified (right ragged).</li>\n<li>Absolutely use multiple columns. I like a three-column layout for simplicity.</li>\n<li>Liberally use relevant images to break up the text. Balance them on the page. Change their location from page to page.</li>\n<li>You can find (public domain *cough*) images on the web, right click them and choose Copy, and then Paste them right into Word where you want them to go (in the text). Highlight the image, then Insert a text box to make it an image you can move around. Under the text box settings (double-click the text box frame, not the image frame), turn off the border and set the wrapping to "tight." Probably set the internal margins to 0". Tell it not to move the image with the text. If you have captions, put them under the image, in the text box.</li>\n<li>Keep the fonts simple. If you don't know what you're doing, pick a decent serif font (like Georgia) for the body text. Times Roman will do. Pick a sans-serif font for headers; consider a "strange" font here for visual interest, but don't overdo it.</li>\n</ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202975/#Comment_202975" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T10:45:17+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 10:45AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, if people are interested, I'm happy to post my Word doc for Metrocalypse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fabrizio" title="Fabrizio"><img alt="Fabrizio" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fabrizio">Fabrizio</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203012/#Comment_203012" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T13:46:16+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  1:46PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Which component of OpenOffice solves these?

Sure, CS4 is out, but it only has a few new features (which have extensive demonstrations and free training online), so the CS3 book line has dropped in price a lot. Have not read it yet (only been a few days since I got it), will give a report later.<br/><br/>When I messed around with my "Jason G is a Gaming Hero" document, I simply followed a few free InDesign tutorials I found online. I googled "InDesign (insert question here)" or "Indesign Basic Tutorial" or the like, and found dozens of web videos from eager-to-help pros who broke it down simple enough for me.<br/><br/>Tutorials take all of the "I want to be helpful" and "I want to be an internet rock star", and wraps it into free learning for the rest of us.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203884/#Comment_203884" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T13:29:57+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  1:29PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I came across some of those same videos, but I find it hard to learn from a tutorial video, so text sources (with images, of course) are great for me.

Even with some experience in the programs, I've learned some nice tips and workflow from those books. The argument against them is that 'they give you too much' and don't start every tutorial building from the ground level, but this is to isolate certain necessary skills and train in the different applications of those skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
