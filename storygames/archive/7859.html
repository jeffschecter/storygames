Several things contribute to this - general busyness, my group's style (fairly jokey, pretty casual), etc. And we've had a lot of fun with games like In A Wicked Age, Hero's Banner, Agon and 3:16, which allowed me to just turn up and run things without a bunch of time spent organizing it.<br/><br/>Then, a couple of months ago, I got a request to run Unknown Armies for a change. After discussion this turned into something Lovecrafty, and I began looking at Nemesis and thinking of ways to run it in an InSpectres style, with everyone having a lot of input into how the mysteries turned out. Which is all cool.<br/><br/>But then I bought myself a copy of Trail of Cthulhu, and this has all changed for me. I am suddenly, once again, filled with ideas for a long campaign, plots of this an that sort, and started scrawling mad ravings into a notebook to keep track of it all. What started up as a little Lovecraft-style short story about some archeologists digging up something unfortunate has begun to grow so that it might lead into a world-spanning fight against the Cthulhu cult to prevent them bringing R'Lyeh to the surface again.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly what prompted it... I'm sure that Ken Hite did a fair amount of the work, of course. The way that he deals with the 'big' things of the Mythos is inspired. The cool bit is the list of different interpretations of each being, allowing you to pick and choose, or reinterpret each in different styles. Plus, the system seems to be a great fit. The last few times I've played Call of Cthulhu, I've found that the BRP system just doesn't make any sense to me any more: too many seemingly unrelated scores and roll types. Gumshoe seems to give a nice coverage: on the one side, a nice system for discovering what is going on in a mystery, and on the other what seems to be a functional system to cover the times when things are trying to chase, murder and eat the investigators. <br/><br/>In any case, it seems strange to be back in that 'plotting a campaign' mindset after so long. To be honest, I thought I would probably never go back to it. <br/><br/>Actually, maybe Tony Dowler is somewhat to blame as well - How To Host A Dungeon is a great way to structure creating your dungeon map, as well as being much more fun than just drawing them ever was.<br/> <br/>Are there any other examples of new games that make this stuff more fun out there? Or anyone else going through a similar de-hippie gamization process?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174251/#Comment_174251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T02:52:15+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  2:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about Acts Of Evil?

This is after a 20-year hiatus. It involves the usual old-school prep and plotting, as well as digging out a dungeon map done in the DOS version of Campaign Cartographer, based on an older map I did when I was twelve. The characters are very, very high level, so I have to devise new challenges (such as the <a href="http://simonjrogers.livejournal.com/77229.html" rel="nofollow">Tarrasque Swarm</a>) to keep them on their toes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
