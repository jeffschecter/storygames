Which isn't too important.  It's just got me wondering, how do you actually make things scary?  For all the bad movies I've watched, and 1840s gothic horror I read, I can't quite capture the feel I'm going for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what are everyone else's experience in horror board gaming?  What as a player have you found particularly moving?  What as a GM have you been particularly proud of?<br/>\n<br/>\nTips to my particular dilemma would be cool, but in general I'd just like to know how other people have overcome this problem in their own games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79176/#Comment_79176" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T17:26:50+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  5:26PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One trick I've used to nice effect is reversals of scale.<br/><br/>You're exploring the abandoned cruise ship, and the words used in descriptions feed you impression of scale - it's big, large, the hold is cavernous, and so on.

The most interesting analysis I have read of this is Ken Hite's "Nightmares of Mine", a slim volume entirely devoted to discussing horror gaming. It's OOP, but I managed to find a copy eventually. He divides up horror into dread, terror and gore. Noclue, for example, is talking about dread, which is the hardest one to get, and the one I'm always shooting for. Terror is more like being chasing by something horrible, and you don't know quite what's happening. It's always shortlived. Gore is self-explanatory, and can be effective in small doses, but needs careful rationing.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is vital, IMO. Even if you just want the players to feel a bit creeped-out (any more than that is a bonus, IMO), they have to find events believable, or they will simply take a mental step back and distance themselves. Details are important - both supplying the ones that are needed, and not supplying too many. When you get it "right", you supply a few details, and the players' minds fill in the rest with whatever they find scary. Phrases like "a muffled thumping", to pick one at random, can produce all sorts of effects. Use all five senses for a more visceral experience. Never explain anything in the moment - relay their perceptions as vividly as you can, and as Colin says, be willing to mess them up. Mimic panic by omitting stuff "There's this...thing...biting your leg". Convey paranoia by street signs that flash messages, or malign impressions of ordinary things. If you've ever been feverish, that's another good one to use.<br/><br/>In your particular game, the problem is going to be making the players feel as though they're really there, as the setting is unfamiliar to most of them (I assume). Think about what details you can offer that will make it seem real, without drowning them in information overload. You have to know a setting well and be confident about improvising in it, IMO, to pull off horror, more so than in most other types of play. If you can evoke the setting convincing, you'll be most of the way there. Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79206/#Comment_79206" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T04:20:11+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  4:20AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The easiest way to make things scary is to have players who choose to be scared.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79207/#Comment_79207" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T04:31:06+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  4:31AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas has a good point. Buy-in from your players is essential. If they are determined *not* to be scared, you're unlikely to make much impression on them. So make sure they're up for creepiness, at the least. But somebody still has to deliver creepy content somehow. The advice I gave was phrased from a trad GMing POV, but I think most of it applies equally to shared narration, etc.<br/><br/>Horror gaming is a bit of challenge to game designers, I think, because there's little you can do at the design level to ensure a scary result (though Dread was a clever idea for at least injecting some tension). It's largely in the execution. If anyone knows of other exceptions, I'd love to be proved wrong here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Cerling" title="Adam Cerling"><img alt="Adam Cerling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.grapevinelarp.com/lantern.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Cerling">Adam Cerling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79244/#Comment_79244" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T07:28:22+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  7:28AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Player buy-in is absolutely necessary.

One way to get "terror" is to enforce time pressures when something happens, and be quick to respond to any actions to keep them grasping at straws. And, of course, you need to be sure to get them to engage before making them regret it, and to make sure they are in a situation they care about. I'm familiar with this sensation whenever I feel like I'm under pressure to perform in a situation that has consequences for failure. Panic, in other words. The whole thing about not showing, but only hinting, is another aspect of this sort of feeling. The stress or suspense in not knowing what's going on but feeling endangered by it and letting your imagination run wild is like that panicking feeling repackaged into a different delivery system. It's sort of a slow bleed of panic. The best horror movies typically maintain this feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDread is definitely the hard one. As I understand it, this is something you typically feel when you are standing still but the world is upturned around you. It requires that you create the ambiance of a world that has connections to you (the one being horrified, not the character in the story). The world, in most cases, is embodied in the things that symbolize and represent the world, rather than the world itself. I mean you can change the whole world, but what's scary is knowing what that means in relation to things you are already familiar with and care about. As far as I can tell, the most important thing is to build those connections. You can do that with really good ambient description, and really effective characterization. What you embody and how effectively you embody it determines the scale of the dread you instill. This needs to be controlled. If the players expect something bigger than the reveal, you're more likely to get a dud.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have a world established and embodied, the corruption of it is probably the easier part, though a really powerful sudden reveal with a long cascade of dreadful realization is ideal. The corruption needs to be revealed or witnessed in a burst. The more they pull back at the sheer scope of it, the better. There needs to be some sort of sudden inversion. Going too slowly from uncorrupted to corrupted makes it more nihilistic or tragic than horrifying. I really think the problem with this sort of horror is that it really is dulled by the cynical expectations most people build up, and so you basically need to rebuild that connection to whatever you are going to flip so that they forget they are cynical, and then flip it. Good storytelling can do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, as I think about it, if you're going for "dread," you'll probably want to avoid overly challenging roleplaying. You want your character to be a PoV, a conduit for your mind's eye. A character that's too quirky or detached from your experience will probably allow you to...detach from the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79445/#Comment_79445" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-04T03:04:35+00:00" title="July  4, 2007  3:04AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kintara,<br/><br/>Good post. As it happens, that's not exactly what Hite means by dread. But I agree, that feeling of the ground suddenly vanishing from underneath you, the sudden realization that everything you know is wrong, is also a great thing to shoot for. <br/><br/>Ken's definition of dread is something like "the pure transfer of fear", without the panic or the revulsion. He cites the techniques of keeping things unseen that others have mentioned, because our fear of the unknown, and the fear we create for ourselves, is usually the most effective kind. Dread is when you're afraid to open the door and find out what's behind it.<br/><br/>Terror moves, dread is frozen. So your "slow bleed of panic" is more like dread, in Ken's terms, with terror being panic proper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
