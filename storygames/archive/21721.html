Number the entries for best usability, so you have value <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, value <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, etc. instead of just a string of numbers. Give one copy to the players, but they don't look at it before the game's over - it's just so they'll know you aren't swapping sheets midway through.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Have a running tally of how many random numbers the GM has used, and have it in public - a big fat calendar-type counter thing, perhaps, that everybody can look at. Ideally you'd want something that gives a satisfying ding every time the GM pushes a button or something, to replace the sound of rolling dice; every ding means that the GM just used a number.<br/><br/><i>(If you're worried that the GM can't keep from looking at the random numbers in advance, you'll just need to craft some sort of a device that allows the GM to look at them one at a time. A simple paper blinder could work - a bookmark with a hole in it that the GM moves over the sheet as they go, which covers the up-coming numbers. Depends on how paranoid you want to get. The sheets could come from a trusted third party, too, of course, or the whole thing could be computerized.)</i><br/><br/><b>3)</b> The players log particularly important GM actions in their notes - they essentially keep a log book of events during the session. An entry says which random number the GM expended and what happened. "#34 random encounter occurred" or "#39 the orc hit character A's AC of 12".<br/><br/><b>4)</b> After the game, the players can use the random number sheet against their log to check that the GM is not fudging their secret rolls. They could find that the random number <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2334&amp;Mode=like">#34</a> was a '2', and therefore the GM cheated, because the rules say that only '1' is a random encounter. Or not, as presumably a GM willing to do this doesn't cheat.<br/><br/>For the record, I'll say that it hasn't occurred to me to seriously use something like this - it would be a pretty special circumstance in which we wanted to play together but did <b>not</b> trust the GM not to cheat. Usually you'd either desist from playing because the GM is a cheat, or play because you trust they're not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475115/#Comment_475115" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-30T09:26:30+00:00" title="June 30, 2018  9:26AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using an app with some sorta logging + notes could be the way to go. This is easier for those who DM online and record their side of the screen. Like <a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">@skinnyghost</a> for his Tomb of Annihilation campaign. (I wish he hadn't rolled that fall from the top of Firefinger tower offscreen, that was one extreme roll and that would've been fun to see.)<br/><br/>For me, it's not just about cheating (although you've been lucky, Eero, we have lots of cheaters here. In fact, since I moved to Sth I've become paranoid af about gaming. Some games with too much hidden procedure become downright unplayable, like Roll For The Galaxy), it's also about shared experience. <i>Together</i> seeing that unusual roll come up.<br/><br/>I've added Fire on the Velvet Horizon monsters to Tomb of Annihilation and there's a one in a thousand chance for <div class="Spoiler">the Navarch of Aa<del>X</del>t -- a devil that rolls up the entire continent into a big blunt, starts piloting the whole tube to Stygia while his crew of imps gather bones and fight moon apes.</div><br/><br/>So everytime that roll is made I'm on the edge of my seat. The players know which number means 'something big, from FotVH' but not what, exactly. But it's still a shared experience spinning that wheel and pulling the trigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475116/#Comment_475116" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-30T09:53:26+00:00" title="June 30, 2018  9:53AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy Crawford, my idol and creator of D&amp;D, just wrote his followers and encouraged them to <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/1012430536785080320?p=v" rel="nofollow">modify encounters on the fly</a>.

And it's great that they're happy but we want something else.<br/><br/>This is why I have a hard time finding DMs. The local DMs who claim to be of the same mind are all on LotFP and S&amp;S. So me seeing a cool class/background combo in 5e is useless. I have to roll up some crappy 1hp, zero-bab 'specialist' in order to play with them.<br/><br/>My only option to find a game my style is to try to teach/train DMs. That includes checking. It's easy to pay lip service to complicated philosophies, and hard to grok them.<br/><br/>I'm reading the Knights of the Dinner Table and one of the players (Brian) was a former DM who is sort of mentoring the current DM (BA). Checking up on rules.<br/><br/>In my own group, that's the play culture I'm trying to foster. Tearing down the GM cult and instead have transparency about rules and calls and stats. Making sure everyone is on board with what the situation is. Having engagement in mechanics, not just story.
