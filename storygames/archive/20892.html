Having extra players may have lighten the load to? Also, we played for 3 hours; with a game like this I would keep the sessions to 3 hours or less personally.

Above, it was implicitly implied that if we play with 5 that one person could play the Magus; instead, we all played our own character and shared the Magus character (which, as you say, is typical). So it was just a clarification, given the other posts, as to what we ended up doing with the 5th player <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458642/#Comment_458642" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-09T16:21:27+00:00" title="December  9, 2016  4:21PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, how did you feel about doing it with 5 players?

This...was suboptimal, mostly because I felt she bigfooted a couple of scenes that just needed to breathe. I think sharing the Magus is actually really crucial, since it binds everyone's conceptions together. And like the blackbird, there are often at least 13 ways of looking at the magus :-)<br/><br/>(In my most recent game I was the apprentice, and Fox was an actual fox. He asked, what is the Magus like? I said, have you ever chased a rabbit for a long time and failed to catch it? The Magus is like that.)<br/><br/>In general when I play I try to include the other players in the scene one way or another, since my GMing style is basically, "split the party, but only into groups of two or more because players talking to each other is more interesting." That definitely lowers the creative burden. OTOH there are places for the solo scene.<br/><br/>FoM really is a kind of miracle in how it produces such remarkable stories. When I start my Actual Play thread I'll share the FoM hack I used to generate PC backstory...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458648/#Comment_458648" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-09T16:43:12+00:00" title="December  9, 2016  4:43PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2016 4:50PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, how did you feel about doing it with 5 players?

I can definitely see what Jason was saying about the introspective nature of the game; if you played with 5 people and didn't break up that introspective tendency it would almost certainly be a total slog. It is a creatively demanding and draining game and I think having an extra person gives the people who need it the time to recharge before their next scene. I would definitely share the Magus character though instead of having someone play it solo.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a>\n<blockquote>FoM really is a kind of miracle in how it produces such remarkable stories.
