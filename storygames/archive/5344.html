To be clear "Conch Shell" mechanics are mechanics that simply parse our narration rights with no regard for in-fiction character goals.  In the original thread John Wick was quoted regarding his Houses of Blooded project.  It pointed out that the system does not resolve in-fiction character success or failure but rather simply establish who can say whether the character succeeds or fails.  In that thread I express my distaste for such mechanics and people have asked me questions about this distaste and so I'm starting this thread to answer them.<br/><br/>This answer is a deeply personal one and may spill over into some dangerous metaphors.  For a game to really work for me there needs to be a significant degree of social risk.  This is why in Big Model terms Step On Up and Story Now work best for me.  I gravitate towards Story Now because I prefer the social risk to concern personal value judgments and emotional vulnerability rather than skill or prowess.  Also see Megs discussions about No One Gets Hurt vs. I Will Not Abandon You play.  I used to be a No One Gets Hurt person but as my gaming tastes have refined I find myself striving more for I Will Not Abandon You.<br/><br/>That said, when I play I commit myself personally to the fiction on a deeply vulnerable level.  I like to throw parts of myself out onto the table for evaluation and judgment from my fellow players.  This is not the same as Actor Stance decision making or "immersion" as that word is usually used.  I do this whether I'm a player with a single character or a GM with authority over multiple characters or whatever combination in between.  Whatever "game units" I control I like to commit myself on a personal emotional level.  Me, Jesse Burneko, am personally spread all over my contributions to the fiction, again in an intensely vulnerable way.<br/><br/>Now, I do this with full understanding that I might get hurt.  And I prefer to play with people who are willing to get hurt back.  I am most satisfied with a game when I walk away feeling beaten and broken but like I've grown closer to and have learned something personally about my fellow players.  Josh Roby once accused me of enjoying RPGs as a, "venue for social violence."  To which I replied if by "violence" he meant like two sparing buddies committed to beating the shit out of each other on the weekends, or fraternity hazing rituals, or consensual bedroom rape play between lovers, then yes, I enjoy RPGs as a "venue for social violence."<br/><br/>This is all because I find personal emotional catharsis fun.  I remember a few months back people talking about how films like "Schindler's List" or "Requiem For a Dream" are "rewarding" but not "fun" and I found myself confused.  No being negatively emotionally impacted is just as "fun" for me as being positively impacted.  I enjoy the sensation of walking out of a movie theater furrowing my brow because what I just saw troubled or disturbed me.<br/><br/>So what has all this got to do with "conch shell" mechanics?  I find that such mechanics inhibit emotional commitment to the fiction in the manner I enjoy.  In the games I enjoy most adversity has to come from somewhere, and it has to be REAL unrelenting unforgiving adversity.  If, we find ourselves in a scene where the adversity player is just as committed to my success as I am then I question his commitment to the source of adversity.  What's so weak or lame about his adversity that he isn't fully emotionally committed to it?  I invite you into my dungeon to play and lay out all the instruments and you come at me with a pillow fight.  It's almost rude and insulting.<br/><br/>On the flip side if I'm so detached from play that failure is willfully acceptable to me then frankly the price of failure isn't painful enough and someone needs to jack the adversity up a notch.  I enjoy unexpected devastating failure as a component of my play but just that -- when it's unexpected and devastating which it won't be if I've willfully chosen it.<br/><br/>In short I enjoy play when I'm passionately and personally committed to the success of my in-fiction game units which is not the same to me as "winning."  Winning is a social thing among the players.  In-fiction success of character agendas is something else.  More importantly I want the other players including those responsible for antagonists, villains, or whatever adversity to play with an equal level of commitment and passion.  To do otherwise is to prioritize other concerns above "Story Now."<br/><br/>I find that people who enjoy "conch shell" mechanics are often committed to "story structure" based on pre-play notions.  They're looking forward to their guy getting his come uppence.  Or they really want a tragedy or they can't wait for the villain to take a dive in the third act.  I don't know or care about outcomes until they happen.  I care about the in-the-moment, here and now, personal struggle of the characters and the choices they make and the actions that follow from it.  So I see no reason to be committed to anything OTHER than following through on the relentless pursuit of their fictional passions.<br/><br/>Edited Note: I once used the metaphor of two fencers who agreed on the parameters of every exchange in advance.  I said that the two fencers might produce a beautiful display of choreography that's enjoyable to watch but the two participants won't ever grow or learn anything about one another AS fencers.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120172/#Comment_120172" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T13:41:16+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  1:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, <br/><br/>Makes sense to me. I'm not quite the same, but I see what you're saying. <br/><br/>My problem with conch shell mechanics is... well, I don't know if I have a problem with the conch in general, but I do with overly simple implementations of it. Like, if the real thing at issue is who gets to say what happens, I'd just as soon work that out between me and the other players. Its all us at the table, so I'd rather not have to have the dice say which us is right. When I go to dice I want to go to dice to get something different, to make something emergent, to make something new and exciting, to make something that none of us controls.

When the mechanics have partial say over the fiction NO ONE person, EVER has control over the course of the story.  No one can "make a tragedy" no one can "guarantee the hero gets revenge."  Might happen, might not happen.  Don't know, there's a random component involved we can prod and nudge but never control.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120194/#Comment_120194" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T14:46:36+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  2:46PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jesse, I'm with you as well. I am currently reading octaNe, which I got for my birthday, and immediately noticed the difference between the resolution system in it and InSpectres. In octaNe it's pretty much that "conch shell" system you describe here, although it has some suggestions on why it's more fun to treat a player has control result as positive, and a GM has control result as negative.<br/><br/>In InSpectres this has become hard-coded into the resolution system. Same basic system, but now it's positive narration at the top end, and negative at the lower end.<br/><br/>I will definitely lean towards playing octaNe more like InSpectres, but we're always up for playing a game as written at least for a session or two.<br/><br/>Nice post by the way,<br/><br/>Yoki                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120224/#Comment_120224" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T17:31:40+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  5:31PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, thanks for posting this.

Inevitably, that dramatic loudmouth impresses everyone with their narration, and the meek inherit jack and shit. Which is not to say that the meek have nothing to contribute. They do. Often, they amaze the fuck out of me! Constraint forces the drama goober to shut up once in a while, and it also forces the meek to speak up and blow us away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120227/#Comment_120227" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T17:55:07+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  5:55PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on Matt! Constraints breed creativity.<br/><br/>I also love systems that take it one step further and allows narration to randomly go to anyone involved in the conflict, such as in Dust Devils and Primetime Adventures. In relation to "Conch Shell" mechanics, I find some of the same disconnects with games that don't fully cover how IIEE works in the game. Not knowing where your constraints are leaves everything up to the narrator and can cause problems with players that haven't firmed up their social contract (I had this happen during a game of PtA with a new group).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120232/#Comment_120232" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:06:57+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:06PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me constraint matters, but I think it may be less important than creation or information. <br/><br/>For example: Trollbabe. When you hit the dice in Trollbabe everyone says what their character is trying. The dice then tell you things about what happens. In the end someone ends up with narrative authority, yes, but in the context of what happened in the free and clear, what happened with dice, re-rolls, and relationship usage. That system does something much more than just determine who gets to speak, and even does more than constraining whomever it is that speaks -- it informs, expands, and molds the story and the events. (I can give more detailed examples if they're wanted.) <br/><br/>It also, as it happens, determines IC wins and loses, which is something that plays into Jesse's bit about real conflict, I think. You can say a lot about how the win or loss happens, but the win or loss rides on the dice. <br/><br/>So Trollbabe is one of those games that has a "dice will show who narrates" thing -- but it isn't really about who narrates, the dice actually determine what happens and shape and further the story and drama by their use outside of the simple function of narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120254/#Comment_120254" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:40:53+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:40PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand - Yes, absolutely.  It reminds of what I describe as Hard Core Primetime Adventures in which certain rules about the High Card narration are taken to their logical extreme.<br/><br/>1) Stakes are the character's in-fiction goal.  The red card count determines if that goal is met or not.  So in-fiction character success/failure is nailed down.  Then the High Card narration rule kicks in.<br/><br/>2) It is important to note that the consequences of failure are NOT negotiated up front.  So when failure occurs High Card guy has carte blanche to hose the character in question.<br/><br/>3) It is also important to note that HOW the character's goal is achieved in the case of success is ALSO not known upfront, which means that High Card guy has carte blanche to attach a price or complication to the character's success.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is what makes getting the High Card in PtA so valuable.  You can not take away or change the character's success or failure but you can spin doctor it all you want.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120255/#Comment_120255" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:42:29+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:42PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I co-designed a game with a friend of mine which started out as a purely "conch shell" system. There was no built-in adversity or real structure and no constraints.<br/><br/>And you know what? There were definite, intense moments of cool conflicting story, where everyone was engaged, and heavily so. But it didn't happen consistently, and it was kind of unsatisfying when it was over. 90% of play was exactly as you describe here--pointless, wandering, and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>So, I agree with you, _almost_ completely. But I will also say that, for people approaching the game from a different perspective than you describe, a "conch shell"-type game could be a lot of fun if it had a lot of constraints built into it. If narrating in the game is like walking a tightrope, showing your skill at creating narrative within narrow boundaries at a level that is truly difficult, that could be fun.

I have no buts or rebuttals.<br/><br/>I do have an "and," though. My other problem with narration-trading systems is that they are ridiculous if you have a functioning game group. In any group that works, given no advice on who says what, an order comfortable to that group will emerge. In some groups, the GM's in charge of all that; more often, everyone contributes, maybe with the winner of a conflict taking lead. In all these cases, if something really rubs someone the wrong way, that's dealt with. A system to specify who talks in this case is useless.<br/><br/>I do enjoy some games that appear to have these mechanics, but the games I enjoy are the precursors to them and actually work differently. Trollbabe specifies who wins, and who's in charge of the outcome of that win, but not that one person gets the talkin' stick. PTA is much the same, although I think PTA's text does its game a great injustice (sorry, Matt!

And, that's all a conch shell mechanic does. So, I don't like that. <br/><br/>Brand, when I say "constraint" I'm talking not about <i>who</i> is constrained from talking. I think you're misreading me significantly. I'm actually talking about how the authority (whoever that is) is constrained from <i>what</i> they must and must not say. That's really important not to confuse here.<br/><br/>We're saying the same thing. Mechanics that are just narration trading don't resolve fictional events. And, resolving fictional events <i>is constraint</i>. That's what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>ALSO! Please note that I want to toss every damn reference to "stakes" right out the window. It ranks right up there with me with conch trading! Somehow among our community, this idea evolved: <br/><br/>"If I win, I get X, but if you win you get Y."<br/><br/>It think this is poisonous to the spontanaeity of ideas in games. It ruins the point of introducing fortune by making it a binary choice at the <i>end</i> of declarations. It's silly. <br/><br/>There's a reason INTENT is part of the IIEE concept. It's because intentions can be altered <i>after</i> the fortune is introduced.

When you hit the dice in Trollbabe everyone says what their character is trying. The dice then tell you things about what happens. In the end someone ends up with narrative authority, yes, but in the context of what happened in the free and clear, what happened with dice, re-rolls, and relationship usage. That system does something much more than just determine who gets to speak, and even does more than constraining whomever it is that speaks -- it informs, expands, and molds the story and the events. (I can give more detailed examples if they're wanted.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, please. I have a friend who's vacillating over playing trollbabe, but is put off by the idea that - since the loser narrates what happens on defeat - you can't actually lose (you always get what you want).

I think Ron used "conch shell" talking about what I believe we're talking about. It was not in the context of what you describe -- that is, a kind of round robin general narration, like "I talk. Ok, now you talk. Ok now Fred." <br/><br/>Rather, what Ron described (I think this was after a bunch of Ronnies entries had somehow created a bunch of narration trading, "conch shell" style hogwash, MINE INCLUDED with Red Rain) was in relation to "resolution" mechanics, which didn't really resolve much in the fiction. Rather, they just got all PTA and Dust Devils inspired and thought "Hell yes! I want to trade around narration mechanically in my games, too!" So, they built resolution, and failed to see key distinctions in those ancestors (again, PTA, Dust Devils, Trollbabe, probably a few others like the Pool) that the mechanics traded narration <i>and resolved conflicts in the fiction</i>. They set limits by doing that latter part, and the narrator had to obey those limits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120346/#Comment_120346" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T07:05:31+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  7:05AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, fair enough.

I'm there. Narrate a failure that involves three lesbians and a taiko drum? OK, I'm on it.  Other nights, though, I'm not in the zone. And for those times, I would much rather have someone with a cool idea narrate the action, than to have the game fall apart because the spotlight is immovably on me, and I'm tired and out of ideas. Likewise, if I have The Best Idea for what that roll meant for your character, I might jump in and say "Hey, I was thinking that when you fail, this happend: XYZ. What do you think?"<br/><br/>* And yet, this too reminds me of the <b>Social Mechanics: Good or Bad</b> discussion we had on S-G in one way: Different games do different things.  While I can say, "I tend not to like games with a talkin' stick", I'm not going to say, "I will NEVER play a game with a talkin' stick, and here's a lengthy discussion of why talkin' sticks are bad for everyone in general..." In other words, I'm up for trying everything, at least once. And maybe even coming back to something I traditionally haven't liked, if it's done in a new way. It's the same way that I tend to be wary of games that give no strength or weight to social stuff (read: lack social mechanics), that is the actual <i>playing of roles</i> in a roleplaying game, I'd still leave myself open to try one again sometime.<br/><br/>So while I got to say that I myself don't like The Talkin' Stick, and tend to be wary of games that include them, I wouldn't go as far as to say that they are inherently unfun/do things bad, or that I would never try one (or try one again).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120360/#Comment_120360" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T08:30:45+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  8:30AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Likewise, if I have The Best Idea for what that roll meant for your character, I might jump in and say "Hey, I was thinking that when you fail, this happend: XYZ.

I'm sure it <i>could</i> be a passing-of-the-conch game, were the players uncooperative; but in each of us framing our actions within a scene, we've had a deeply immersive, powerfully emotional narrative play experience that's engrossing and enthralling. Part of that, I believe, is the distinct lack of mechanical merits and flaws within the character, merely a set of questions which each player must answer about themselves.<br/><br/>We've hacked the ashcan somewhat, to where, instead of earning the right to narrate an answer to your own question, you earn the right to answer, either individually or as a whole, a plot question, such as "why are the Cabals of Maddra following us wherever we go?" or "Who is the man in the green sweater?" Sometimes, if the GM has a specific answer, he'll say "Hey, I've got that one right here;" or, sometimes it's more like "Hey, I have a <i>possible answer</i> to that one, but first I'd like to hear what you guys think is happening."<br/><br/>It's not as caustic to the narrative as the reverse engineering mechanics found in a lot of detective games ("I think we're going to have the murderer be that guy *rolls* Yay!"), but still allows a modicum of back-loaded ominousness to play, where we as our characters can suddenly feel that ominous sense of doom as we learn of our fates; or it could just as easily get pulled back a notch, where that horror vibe of "Don't open the door! Ahhh!" takes place in our minds, because we know what our character will do, and have an inkling of what might happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120386/#Comment_120386" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T10:19:49+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 10:19AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite><br/>Yes, please.

If you fail you do not get that thing. You can narrate hell and high water keeping you from getting it, but saying that you get it anyway or in any way, is against the rules. <br/><br/>One of the examples from a recent Trollbabe game that I played went something like this: <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Brand GM: So the horde of barbarians is coming down on top of you, and they are going to kill the girl. <br/><br/>Player: No way, I am going to save her. I will wade into the middle of them with sword and axe, and inflict such slaughter that they will flee. <br/><br/>Brand: Awesome, they're going to try to just roll around you as they care about you much less. They'll use the hills to their advantage, trying to force you away from the girl. <br/><br/>Player: Good, lets roll.  (Rolls, fails)<br/><br/>Player: Damnit! Okay, they sweep in and by weight of numbers push me away from the top of the hill, pushing me back and down the slope with the weight of numbers. (This is the player being discommoded, as he's about to go for a reroll. He has to show himself being put at disadvantage, but doesn't have to lose yet.) <br/><br/>Brand: Yea, and the loose heather and scrub is slippery under your boots, crushing and sliding with every twist of your feet to meet the dozens of blows raining down on you from above. (This is me just adding color, I've got no "narrative right" but I can say stuff. Its just it doesn't stick if the player doesn't like it.) <br/><br/>Player: Hmm... However, there is a large, flat shelf of granite sticking out of the side of the hill...<br/><br/>Brand: What about if its an old tomb, or a fallen standing stone, carved with spiraling glyphs of a lost civilization? <br/><br/>Player: Yea, and it narrows at one end and sticks up at a point, and I beat the barbarians back for a moment and yell at the girl to go up it, and then go up myself, backwards, facing the enemy. Now they can't surround me and have to come up the stone at me<br/><br/>Brand: With your blood and their's mixing in the ancient grooved spirals? <br/><br/>Player: Yea, so that's a check on my "geographical feature" for a reroll. (That whole thing with the fallen standing stone was because we both knew this is what he was doing, it changed the course of the narration. He rolls again, and fails again.)<br/><br/>Player: Lots of cursing<br/><br/>Brand: So you stopping? <br/><br/>Player: Hell no. So this one barbarian, a big nasty guy with the face of a brutal animal, draped in heavy grey furs with lots of claws, comes in with a maul and starts driving me back and back. <br/><br/>Brand: His breath is fetid, his eyes wild, obviously in a berserker state as froth foams up around the corners of his lips...<br/><br/>Player: And with one massive swipe he misses me as I twist back and fall down, my arm breaking where it hits the hard edge of the stone, and when his maul strikes it cracks the stone itself. <br/><br/>Brand: And the stone starts to shift its weight, getting ready to roll and crush you all under its methuselahian bulk. (This is all part of him narrating his failure, and includes him becoming injured, as he's about to go for another reroll.) <br/><br/>Player: I would die then, but the girl reaches down, desperate, and starts dragging me backwards, hurling lose stones at the berserker long enough to keep him off of me so I can get to my feet. (He now uses his relationship to the girl for a reroll, he fails again. He's now going to be incapacitated, and the girl is going to die, the only question is if he gets to describe it or I do. He lets me have it, not going for the final reroll.) <br/><br/>Brand: You get to your feet, but one of the barbarians at the bottom hurls his body into the cracking stone, deliberately furthering the crack so that it snaps with a sudden resounding thunder and sends you, the berserker, and the girl flying down the hill in an avalanche of heather and stone, furs and weapons and tangled limbs. <br/><br/>Player: And just before everything goes black I see her as the huge stone falls upon her, crushing the life from her young body.<br/><br/>Brand: Yea, blood pouring from her lips. Then the stone falls on you with the weight of all its ages, and you know no more for a long time. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Now, if at any of the points where he lost if he didn't describe getting injured, discomoded, or whatever, he'd be breaking the rules. If he'd described the girl getting away, he'd be breaking the rules. If he loses he could have described the whole barbarian nation coming for him, overwhelming him 1000000000 to 1 or something -- but the girl is still going to die. That cannot be changed, because he lost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120393/#Comment_120393" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T10:47:59+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 10:47AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so lots of posts about passing the Conch is bad.

I didn't take the hubris/arete choice nor the ... um... thing you call the four suits... seriously enough, and didn't really get the long term potential of points. So a lot of the game ended up being "I do this" "no this will happen" "lets have a conflict and find out who gets to say" stuff. And as a result it flopped. It was only when I started really using points and the full implications of the suits and really grinding those home, without any kind of pre-narration, and having multiple chained conflicts linking into each other, that I was able to get past it. To this day I often have trouble expressing to folks why Nine Worlds does more the conch pass, despite the fact I'm sure it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120413/#Comment_120413" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T11:45:31+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 11:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2008 11:57AM by Jesse.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To quickly address Graham earlier point: I see the distinction you're making but to me Houses of the Blooded determining who gets to decide success or failure and not success or failure itself is a subset of the larger Conch Shell issue.  I've seen a few games that go that extra mile where there is literally narration rights of ANYTHING "zombies attack!", "no, I say they're ninjas!"  "Roll for it!".  But I admit that most of these are Game Chef games and the like and I don't think I know of any that have made it to publication.<br/><br/>To get to Valamir's point.  octaNe works this way with high die roll simply having control over what happens with the mechanic actually providing no information.  I don't know how this worked out in play because the one time I played octaNe I replaced the chart in that book with the one from Inspectres which DOES include success and failure as part of its resolution.  Over all I didn't like my experience with octaNe because it really does contain minimal feedback between fiction and mechanics unless Hazards are involved.  Otherwise, it's just a roll and talk, roll and talk, roll and talk game with no momentum in the mechanics.<br/><br/>I think The Pool as written in the text simply trades narration rights between player and GM but again I've always played it that success and failure are also determined by the roll outcome.<br/><br/>Capes works this way in that whoever wins a Goal or Event gets to decide how it works out.  This lead to some weird cases in actual play.  I enjoyed Capes most when people were fighting on opposite sides of a Goal.  The conflict in the fiction clearly WAS whether the Goal succeeded or failed.  However, because of the way Capes works there were several times when two people were fighting over the Goal but both clearly wanted the same general OUTCOME for the Goal but wanted the details of how that outcome came to be to different.  And so their was this disconnect I did not like between the Goal written down on the index card and the ACTUAL fictional conflict at hand.  The Goal was clearly going to succeed or fail one way or the other because the people fighting over the Goal were in agreement about the general OUTCOME but were fighting over details such as who actually achieves the Goal or something like that.  So the actual conflict in the fiction was really say, two character competing for media coverage or two characters fighting over shared lover, or fighting over something that wasn't actually represented by any of the index cards on the table.  So you had all these "hidden" conflicts being resolved basically by fiat over narration rights for a conflict that basically wasn't really a conflict because everyone was in agreement about the outcome.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich" title="Will Grzanich"><img alt="Will Grzanich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich">Will Grzanich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120428/#Comment_120428" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T12:24:24+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 12:24PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I think The Pool as written in the text simply trades narration rights between player and GM but again I've always played it that success and failure are also determined by the roll outcome.</blockquote>\nNaw.\n<blockquote><cite>The Pool</cite>If you chose to add a die to your Pool then the GM will narrate a positive outcome to the conflict, but he will do so any way he chooses. This means things might not go exactly the way you wanted.<br/>...<br/>If you fail a die roll two things will happen. First, you will lose any dice you gambled. Second, the GM will narrate an outcome that is not what you intended. The details of the outcome are entirely up to him. He may introduce new complications for your character or simply narrate a scene that is opposite of what you wanted.</blockquote>\nI'm thinking that by-the-book Pool requires that success at the dice = positive outcome, and failure = negative outcome.  I guess that leaves a little wiggle room as far as whether "positive outcome" equates to "you got exactly what you wanted," and similarly for "an outcome that is not what you intended," but otherwise, I think it's played as you describe "hardcore Pool" as being played.

Nixon</cite>Jesse,<br/><br/>I agree with what you said. I have no buts or rebuttals.<br/><br/>I do have an "and," though. My other problem with narration-trading systems is that they are ridiculous if you have a functioning game group. In any group that works, given no advice on who says what, an order comfortable to that group will emerge. In some groups, the GM's in charge of all that; more often, everyone contributes, maybe with the winner of a conflict taking lead. In all these cases, if something really rubs someone the wrong way, that's dealt with. A system to specify who talks in this case is useless.</blockquote>\nI find that this is true within a relatively narrow band of play.  As long as you're adventurers seeking a MacGuffin or (in the Durham 3's case) characters trapped in terrible circumstances making their circumstances worse, or some other familiar ground, the group will make it work by relying on "how we usually do this sort of thing."  However, if you change the formula enough, those assumptions fall away.  This problem was, far and away, the most frequent item of feedback I got on the Sons of Liberty playtest.  Nobody knew who talked when, and because the play experience is unlike their prior experience, they had no assumptions to fall back on.  I needed to add "who talks when" procedures applicable to crazy turnless card game plays.  Otherwise the game kinda crashed.<br/><br/>Also, Jesse, in your Capes example, isn't the "appropriate" systemic solution to open a new conflict stating what's really at stake?  I should think that would clear things up considerably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120454/#Comment_120454" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T14:34:49+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  2:34PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2008 2:51PM by Jesse.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/><br/>I think Sons of Liberty is SO far out of the scope of this conversation.

I don't think Sons of Liberty makes any claims on the things I'm talking about in this thread.<br/><br/>I was very excited about Houses of the Blooded's premise.  Passion, revenge, love!  Oh, except that its central resolution mechanic happens to be one that I know from experience guts the kind of passion driven play I want out Houses's core selling point.<br/><br/>As for Capes I'd have to re-read the rules but your solution while possible isn't practically applicable.  It would require someone a) noticing a shift in conflict stakes and b) spending a turn to put that out there on the table.  Which *might* be an effective way to shift the attention of a couple of players away from one Goal and onto another but certainly the participants involved in the conflict wouldn't waste a turn doing that after they've clearly committed so many resources and actions to the other now side-goal.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120456/#Comment_120456" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T14:36:55+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  2:36PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I havent seen enough of HotB to know if it has purely conch shell mechanic or if it merely sounded that way from that bit of discussion on the podcast.

Sure, in many cases, a group can sort that out -- but it's hardly a universal, and the inclusion of such "traffic cop" procedures aren't a sign of needless or baroque design.<br/><br/>I don't consider SoL a conch-shell game, nor is it a venue for social violence as you prefer.  We can elaborate if you like, but I don't want to derail your thread.<br/><br/>Regarding Capes, creating a distraction goal does take a turn, sure, but when you have multiple characters and actions per turn, this is less of an issue.  This is, still, something of a weakness in the game design.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I find the shifting of goals within a conflict as you describe to be annoying if not maddening.  To me, this often feels like a breach of social contract -- I feel like the players agree to consider one theme or conflict and then, without actually addressing the first thing, players shift to another.  This shift is usually, in my experience, performed through player-to-player social manuevering and pressure outside of game procedures.  I get all jazzed about one thing and then players decide to shift focus away such that I can't respond.  Mechanics like Capes' explicit recognition of specific goals is an attempt (and perhaps here a flawed attempt) to prevent that by formalizing shifts in focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120468/#Comment_120468" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T15:33:51+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  3:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, <br/><br/>Yes, and they're great for that.

Because, honestly, when something has been addressed to satisfaction isn't universally constant, and sometimes things get introduced that turn out lame and I'd rather move on.

If I'm the only one at the table engaged in a given thing, there should be procedures to either shift immediately or quickly resolve it and move on.  In the absence of those procedures, resorting to social pressure is not an acceptable option to me.  You need a different game.<br/><br/>This is not to say that I categorically dislike shifts in focus; rather, I dislike that focus shifting and me not being able to do anything about it.<br/><br/>Jesse, I am assuming your ideal game allows for these shifts in some way -- be it procedural, mechanical, or even a matter of expectation.

Social negotiation, social understanding, whatever. Pressure I rarely find acceptable. <br/><br/>However, I think the default paradigm divide between us remains. In the times where issues of play becomes problematic between players, sharply differently than being between characters, I'd rather work it out between players than work it out mechanically. I find rolling a dice or spending resources to tell me how to deal with another person at the table to be unacceptable and at odds with why I play RPGs. (Its fine with boardgames, though rarely comes up in boardgame rules.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120479/#Comment_120479" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T16:10:41+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  4:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure.  And lots of games allow for those shifts to happen without any need to flag them in any special way.  Sorcerer does this well.  Spione does it well (from what I've read).  Hell, Dogs in the Vineyard does it fairly well to the point that Stakes are almost not needed in some cases.  Sure, "I want him to see the error of his ways" is a nice broad starting point to get things going but the microcosm of Dogs conflicts can shift around rapidly and whether he breaks down begging for forgiveness or the "error of his ways" is just the last twinkle in his dying eyes is a rather VAST landscape of outcomes. <br/><br/>Capes doesn't suffer from this problem when people stay strictly on opposing sides of Goals. It mostly happens with Events and when people are fighting over HOW a Goal pans out ran than IF it pans out. It quickly becomes clear that the actual fictional conflict of interest has nothing to do with the Goal or Event and that often who wins not only resolves the Goal/Event but also resolves the unarticulated conflict as well.  My issues isn't so much that that happens but that the game is supposed to TRACK outcomes (inspiration points, story tokens, etc) but when people don't strictly stay on opposing sides of the index cards then all these UNTRACKED conflicts get introduced and resolved often without any particular notice (which may ultimately be a feature).<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If exactly zero people have an interest in narrating something, we should either skip ahead, flip a coin, or end the scene and take a break.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. If exactly one person wants to narrate something, then they should be able to narrate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. If multiple people want to narrate something, there should be some mechanism/protocol for combining their inputs (maybe roll to decide the decider, or some bargaining mechanism, or bidding, or one decides outcome other narrates details, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the system should automatically and seamlessly implement these three states, without the need to go to social-level. So I'm not sure if I disagree with the OP. For example, if the question is "does Hagar the barbarian succeed?" and Fred, the player most commonly associated with Hagar, wants the answer to be "yes" and noone else cares and noone else wants to narrate, should someone be forced to take the opposing position? If two players want to narrate, Fred and Carl, and both want Hagar to succeed, but succeed for different reasons, should one of them be forced to narrate failure if they "Win" narration rights?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, if at any instant in time noone is in the mood to bring adversity (or thinks at that instant the story would not be well served by adversity) should someone nevertheless be forced to try to bring in adversity toward the character?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121274/#Comment_121274" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T11:58:54+00:00" title="January 22, 2008 11:58AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello.<br/><br/>Given the last few posts I feel I need to clarify a few things.<br/><br/>1) I have no problem with mechanics that specify narration rights.  I have a problem with games that ONLY specify narration rights.  I like Trollbabe and Primetime Adventures.  I don't like octaNe, certain cases of Capes play and the raw description of Houses of the Blooded's "resolution" mechanic (obviously I haven't played it so maybe there's some surrounding support structure that makes it work more to my liking).<br/><br/>2) cydmab asked "What if no one particularly wants to bring adversity?"  Then it seems to me that one of two things is going on.  There is no actual adversity within the fiction itself in which case I'm fine, you succeed at whatever you're doing.  The second is that adversity DOES exist in the fiction but no one is invested it.  To which I have to ask the question why not?  Which is obviously unanswerable in a general sense.  <br/><br/>However, different games have different procedures for dealing with that second situation.  Dogs in the Vineyard has "say yes or roll the dice" which effectively translates into "just Give on any conflicts that aren't worth it to you."  Ron is pretty adamant that Sorcerer has no such rule and if a conflict of interest arises among the fictional characters your roll the dice and abide by the outcome, period.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121739/#Comment_121739" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T13:12:31+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  1:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think my 555-word microgame, <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/205190.html" rel="nofollow">Facts</a>, is a conch shell game.
