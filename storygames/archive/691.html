                    Chris and I have been knocking Push and Pull out very fruitfully over on <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/05/push-and-pull-lets-nail-this-down.html" rel="nofollow">Deep in the Game</a>. Thanks Chris!<br/><br/>Here are your no-nonsense definitions:<br/><br/><b><i>Push is an assertion of individual authority.<br/><br/>Pull is a directed solicitation for collaborative buy-in and input.</i></b><br/><br/>Both Push and Pull are a part of fundamental human communication patterns. They are tools used in social interactions that provide movement to the interaction and provoke response and action within it.<br/><br/>In a RPG context, Push and Pull happen both as they do in a non game context (socially and incidentally because we are still people engaging in interaction), and as techniques used to affect the game, the social environment and the drama. Both Push and Pull can be mechanically or non-mechanically supported, functional or dysfunctional, effective or non-effective. Neither is inherently better or worse than the other, though people can have preferences for one or the other.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Push</span></b><br/><br/>A player, using a Push technique, uses his own authority to put something out there. This something could be an assertion of an element or action into the fiction, it could be something in the social contract that causes or prevents something from happening (E.g. identifying that an NGH or TTP line has reached a hard stop) or in other ways (IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not going to categorically list them here, that could be a discussion for a future time, suffice to say that although a push can be used as a technique to address the fiction, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not tied to it).<br/> <br/><b>Push Example #1: </b><br/><br/>Game: Truth &amp; Justice<br/><br/>Situation: The heroine has just found out that she has a long lost brother, and that her brother idolizes her secret identity for her work in the same science area that he is studying in. She, a mutant with precognative abilities, has a vision in which her estranged father and long lost brother are in a mall when a group of assassins break in and try to kill them. She could go save them, but if she does a whole busload of schoolgirls who have been captured by an evil cult will die terrible horrible sacrificial deaths. She chooses to go save the schoolgirls, because the ritual that they are being killed in may prove very, very bad for the world. In the vision where her brother and father are, the guns ring out, the bullets fly, and the father and brother are gunned down, their blood splattering.<br/><br/>The player (me) takes 4 hero points and hands them to the GM (Brand), declaring Ã¢â‚¬Å“Major Detect &amp; Discover. Josh [the brother] is a mutant too. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t die.Ã¢â‚¬Â Brand cackles and gives time powers to Josh, so that when the reality of the precog vision comes true, he rewinds time in the second before he dies and uses his power to take out the villain, saving himself and their father.<br/><br/>I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want the brother to die without having my character have a chance to interact with him, so I used a mechanic available to me to make it not happen.<br/><br/><b>Push Example #2:</b><br/><br/>Game: Unbreakable (A home-styled nar game) thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loosely styled on the themes of  M NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s movie Unbreakable.<br/><br/>Situation: Our hero has been putting his ass on the line to make his Alphabet City neighborhood a safer place. In doing so, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pissed off a number of gangs in the area. In a previous bang, he had seen a member of the gang that has been hunting him down being shaken down by three guys of a rival gang over mule-ing drugs through their territory. Arjuna had interceded, scared the rival gangs off and saved the kidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. He even gave him back the drugs, as a show of good faith/bribe to leave his block alone.<br/><br/>The kid, afraid of what would happen if the leader found out about getting his ass saved by an enemy hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t passed the message on, so in another scene, when ArjunaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d come face to face with the sociopathic leader of the main gang, and had pointed out his show of good faith, the fit hit the shan. The gang leader thanked him for the interaction, and declared the feud between them over. He told Arjuna he would take care of the discrepancies.<br/><br/>Coming home that night, the GM (me) declares that in the vacant lot behind his house, the kid is dead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ gutted Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and has been left on display for him. The area has been police taped, and cops are on the scene. Alongside the body: the knapsack, likely still carrying his prints.<br/><br/>I put something down in front of him that said: Here, deal with that shit.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pull</span></b><br/><br/>A player, using a Pull technique, solicits another playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buy-in or input. This can happen by catering input to the other playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tastes, by enticement, by reward, by negotiation, by collaborative mutual decision (and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure there are other ways) Again, the Pull can be used to influence the fiction, but Pull techniques are not limited to the fiction.<br/><br/><b>Pull Example #1: </b><br/><br/>Game: Truth &amp; Justice (the same game as Push #1)<br/>Situation: Heroine encounters a villain for the first time. The game has a very graphic novel feel, and the social contract of the game has it established that there is (like many comic books) usually a pattern wherein at the first meeting, the villain will gets away, eluding the heroine.<br/><br/>The scene is set in a bank with a robbery underway, the mooks present are human goons for hire with lots of bad ass weaponry, the main villainess is a sexy succubus-y she-devil that is enrapturing the Bank Manager. The character comes in with great pith and daring do, and faithfully begins to kick the asses of the mooks en route to the main villainess. The mooks prove to be too numerous and too underhanded and threaten the innocents in the bank, but if she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something about it, the villainess will get away with the booty!<br/>The heroine takes the only action she has to spare to do a single attack on the villain, knocking her away from the bank manager, and into the vault and as part of her description says:<br/><br/>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paper bank notes and bills flutter away from the hefty vault door as it slams shut with a satisfying THUD and a long series of clicks that lock the Hell Queen in its deep heart, keeping the bankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patrons safely clear of her terrible, evil tactics!Ã¢â‚¬Â The player (me), turns to the GM (Brand), raises an eyebrow and says in overly accentuated, sarcastic way:<br/><br/>Ã¢â‚¬Å“And DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu turns back and focuses her FULL attention on the members of Terror Inc, FULLY CONFIDENT that her Ã¢â‚¬Å“safe depositÃ¢â‚¬Â will be waiting for her once she has taken care of the gunboys!Ã¢â‚¬Â Wink wink, nudge, nudge.<br/><br/>Brand, grins and says Ã¢â‚¬Å“Revolting Development?Ã¢â‚¬Â and I cheer, roll my dice and cash in on hero points which I then use to lay a righteous smackdown on the Terror Inc boys. When I get back to the vault to collect the villain, there is a hole melted in the floor, and the villainess and the booty are, of course, long, long gone.<br/><br/>If the villain had to get away, this time I wanted her to get away because something completely unexpected (to the character) had happened while my character continued to do the righteous smackdown. I was also low on Hero Points and knew that the Revolting Development would pay off. So, because I wanted these things, I created a situation where both requirements could be fulfilled, and one that I knew would be appealing enough for Brand to pick up on.<br/><br/>I wanted to go in a direction and so I made it a direction that Brand would like so that we could go that way together.                </div>

<b>Pull Example #2:</b><br/><br/>Game: Breaking the Ice<br/><br/>Situation: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting on to the end of the third date, and the fates of the lovers are being decided. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve racked up a pretty high attraction score, but their compatibility rating is low. This is reflected in the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiction. The characters have never been ambivalent about each other; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never fully managed to make it to a place where they click romantically, but they end up in bed despite that. Afterwards, one of the characters (mine) shows a bit of the desperation of the act by drawing a parallel between watching the woman he just lay with as she slept and the love of his life that died in a car accident (in which he was driving in heavy rain) a year ago. The other player (Brand) finding the earlier silly-ish game ending on too dour a note, wanting a chance at a bonus die, and knowing that I have a penchant for elegiac romance, wakes his character up and has her comfort him, saying in character:<br/><br/>Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can't promise that I'll be here forever, or even that I'll love you forever, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m here now, and I love you now, and that's enough. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mistake to think you were driving then, or that you are driving now. Life is hydroplaning, and there isn't any control to be had.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/><br/>And he earned the bonus die, and in their mutual comfort earned the one last compatibility (#3) that gave them at least a slim shot of making it as a couple.<br/><br/>Brand wanted something with more hope, and he wanted the characters to have a chance, so he found a way to appeal to my tastes in game to use a mechanically supported tool that allowed me to reward his pull.<br/><br/><br/><b>Why is any of this important?</b><br/><br/>Well, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re designing, analysis of these kinds of social transactions and how they differ from each other helps you understand what kind of game you are creating, and who will be happy with it.<br/><br/>Now, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never used the Power 19, because my brain naturally does this sort of thing without needing the tool, but it seems to me that if it represents a list of the things that are important to consider in game design and theory (which it seems to be, considering how many talk about it/use it), that discussion of social transactions such as Push and Pull are intrinsically connected to the following questions:<br/><br/><code>6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?<br/>7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?<br/>9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)<br/>10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?<br/>11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?<br/>14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?<br/>19.) Who is your target audience?</code><br/><br/>If the idea is to intentionally build games that cater to the target audience to maximize the potential fun that could be had by them, then it would be extremely helpful to consider whether the game coexists peacefully with the skills of your target audience and provide extra, explicit support to the skills that are not inherent to the group.<br/><br/>Conversely, if your target audience is Ã¢â‚¬Å“As many people as goddamn possible.Ã¢â‚¬Â? Well, then, understanding the kinds of different play out there helps you to identify where support will be needed to get different players to peacefully co-exist in the same game while achieving the maximum potential for fun.<br/><br/><b>Example in Action:</b><br/><br/>I put my observations of Push and Pull into direct application in Crime and Punishment. In life, I like Pull. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energizing, it builds. I am less comfortable with Push, it feels confrontational and space invading. Now this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find Push usefulÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ obviously I do, because I employ Push techniques in my games and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Crime and Punishment is designed to build collaborative environments that build investment between members of the player group to provide a basis and support for applying hardcore Push.<br/><br/>Huh?<br/><br/>Read the game. The entire first half is all built on Pull techniques: the players contribute ideas, solicit investment, and earn the approval and buy in of the other players to create a communal endeavor. The second half of the game  is all Push. In this environment of investment and reinforced by the framework we have built together, players can now Push hard against each other to maximize the potential of the storyboard,  and to make the drama come to life. The mechanics support  this part, too. You use the investment of other players that you have earned, to bid and buy and win how you want things to happen in the game.<br/><br/>Please go read C+P with all of this in mind.<br/><br/>While youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at it, if all of this has finally made some semblance of coherent sense, you might want to go read a bunch of stuff again:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/2006/01/push-vs-pull.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/2006/01/push-vs-pull.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/2006/01/pull-clarification-and-promises.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/2006/01/pull-clarification-and-promises.html</a><br/><a href="http://yudhishthirasdice.blogspot.com/2006/01/brand-pushes-and-pulls-and-blows.html" rel="nofollow">http://yudhishthirasdice.blogspot.com/2006/01/brand-pushes-and-pulls-and-blows.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/05/push_and_pull_e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.20by20room.com/2006/05/push_and_pull_e.html</a><br/><br/>I think thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all I have for now.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>~Mo<br/><br/>(Edited to add this very excellent link that I was too busy putting writing this to notice at the time: <a href="http://www.thesmerf.com/blog/23-push-and-pull-appeals-to-authority" rel="nofollow">Thomas Robertson's <i>Push and Pull: Appeals to authority</i></a>)                        </div>

                            I think the definition of Push is missing something.  But I'll hold off on that for the 24 hours because it might be interpreted as a bullet.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, let me go over to the Pull side and ask this followup question:<br/>
<br/>
Is a flag a kind of a pull?  Or is it something else?<br/>
<br/>
Example: I put down on my Heroquest character sheet the trait "Distrusts red-haired women."  Is that a pull, of a sort, inviting situations where his trust or distrust of a red-haired woman matters?  It seems to me that it might be.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a flag could also be a kind of a push.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe pushes and pulls both can come under the category of flags.                        </div>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>I'd think that a flag is either a push or a pull, at least inherently. A push or a pull is something someone does. A flag is a tool that helps people focus the game. So flags will often act as focuses for push or pull, but are not themselves either. <br/><br/>For example, Keys in TSOY give you a good reason to push your characters story into the fiction -- you get XP when you do so. But until you start using the flag, it does nothing. If you make a TSOY character that is not part of a game and then show him to someone who isn't going to be playing with you nothing on the sheet can possibly be push or pull -- it's just things on a sheet waiting to be brought to life when you actually play. But until people start discussing and using, collaberating, and challenging the Belief it isn't either a push or a pull, it is a flag waiting for the wind to blow it one direction or the other. <br/><br/>Now, this can seem confusing because it often seems like flags are doing those things on their own. You put a flag down, and magically the GM starts running an interesting plot for you. But the truth is that is a matter of social engagement, social systems, and people actually reacting to each other at the table. If it is in your social contract that when you change a belief the GM must immediatly set up a scene challanging it, for example, and you change a belief it is not the new flag that magically makes the scene, it is the GM as a person reacting to the thing you just did as a person, and not the flag as magical motivator. The flag just lets you communicate, it is not the actual communication. <br/><br/>Flags are excellent, they say "Push/Pull me here" or "I will Push/Pull here" but they aren't themselves actions. In fact, they aren't anything but words until they hit the social situation and play at the table where they act as a spur and a frame for the actual actions of play.                        </div>

                            Very nice.<br/><br/>possible question:<br/>'Assertions' often imply 'directed' or 'target'.  I could see 'Pull' dropping the 'directed' as well, since I think 'solicitation' is just as good a stand alone verb.                        </div>

                            Arref, <br/><br/>I dunno, I find the "directed" to be kind of important. <br/><br/>Check out the 12th comment on the Deep in the Game thread to see why. It's about the difference between a general social pull and pull as a method of directing game.<br/><br/>P.S.

                            It might also be very important for people to recognize that Pushes and Pulls are discrete actions that happen moment to moment- all the time.  Throughout play, you could go, "That's a Push", "That's a Pull" and see them firing back and forth amongst the group the whole time.<br/><br/>Formal mechanics help us coordinate and organize them so we don't end up tripping all over each other or arguing who can do what and when.                        </div>

                            Hey,<br/><br/>I wanted to run this by anyone who missed it in my blog post yesterday, because I think it's a good observation.  However, since no one's really mentioned it, I wonder, and I wanted some feedback...
<blockquote>Also, and this is, I think, important: people tend to prefer what they are good at. I would suggest that at least one reason Mo (and others) prefer pull is because they are better at pulling than pushing. That is, they more often achieve their desired ends via pulling than pushing. When a game is designed to facilitate push-focused play, then the people who are good at pulling are at a disadvantages. The techniques that they are best at are hard to use, while the techniques that they are not so good at are made easy. This makes it harder for them to achieve desired goals than it is for push-oriented people to achieve desired goals. And that is why this distinction matters.</blockquote>
I think this is a big deal, and one we've not talked much about with the topic.  Of course it's possible that it's off-topic here...  Mo, what do you think?  Does this strike you as accurate?<br/><br/>EDIT:  Oh yeah...  For those who want to see the entire article: <a href="http://www.thesmerf.com/blog/23-push-and-pull-appeals-to-authority" rel="nofollow">Push and Pull, Appeals to authority</a>.

Can we identify games that are oriented more towards pushes or pulls?<br/>

I'd like to offer one to start with, that Capes is very, very push-oriented.                        </div>

                            Thomas,<br/><br/>Yes, absolutely, that is one of the reasons why the distinction matters. I would say everyone is likely better at one (however greatly or slightly) than the other, and that everyone has a preference (however big or little) for one over the other. Playing in the one you're not as good at, or don't like as much will take more energy and focus while playing in the one you like and do better will be more intuitive and fun.<br/><br/>Even if you're not designing, understanding that is useful to understanding why two players can't agree on what game to play, or why one person has difficulty in a game while another doesn't - or why it is that we can't sell harcore-pushy Forgey Nar games to dirty hippie freefromers or concvince them to even try playing them.<br/><br/>To someone with a strong preference for pull a pitch like:  "It's so cool! You get to decide what the conflict is about and then you can totally win narration rights! If I win, I can make anything I want to happen, happen!" Can sound like: "It's totally cool! As long as the dice/cards/blah are right I can completely disregard your input!". Or, if they're not skilled: "It's so cool! I can run right over you!"<br/><br/>Conversely, to a strong preference push player hearing a pitch like: "It's so cool! You have to cater to the desires of the other people to earn their investment to be able to make things in the game happen!" can sound like "It's so cool! You have to bog down your play in negotiation and sucking up in order to get anything accomplished!"  Or if they're not skilled: "It's so cool! I can completely make you feel like a dork!"<br/><br/>If you understand what people like in games you can explain your game to them in ways that will turn them on, not off.<br/><br/>This is a good topic, and one that I'd like to discuss in more detail. Thomas, maybe after the weekend you could start a thread?<br/><br/>~Mo                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Depends on social contract. I think that Alex F got towards this on the <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/05/push_and_pull_e.html#comments" rel="nofollow">20x20 Room thread.</a> (which is really worth reading, I think). <br/><br/>He said, speaking about Nar games specifically: <code>*Push is when you make another player address something<br/>*Pull is when you show another player there is something you want to address that they may want to address as well.</code><br/><br/>So, in the games you're thinking about it sounds pretty push based. You have used your authority to assert something in the fiction in order to make the other person respond. If you instead solicited their response before inserting it into the fiction, it would be a pull. <br/><br/>However, all of that depends on where your social contract puts the way you have to respond. Seriously, you can't get at it without the social backgrounding of what is going on. Jess (below) is right about that, and check out my reply to Alex in the 20x20 thread above. <br/><br/>This, I know, is where I was getting hung up before and totally screwing up everyone who tried to talk to me about the subject.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I'd say it depends on what the perceived consequence of the challenge is.  If its, "If you don't do something about this, I get to have things my way," that's a Push.  If it's, "If you don't do something about this, then, well, you missed an opportunity for us to make something cool together," that's a Pull.  But again, this is just my own understanding - which may be different from Mo and Brand's, but which is turning out to be useful to me nonetheless.<br/><br/>Thomas, your analysis in terms of authority is spot-on.

                            If this counts as a bullet, I'll happily retract it, but are "push" and "pull" the best terms for this?  I've had a lot of trouble following this debate here and elsewhere because of the vagueness of the terms.  If the core of "push" is an assertion, wouldn't _assert_ be a clearer, better resolved term?  If the core of "pull" is solicitation, wouldn't _solicit_ be clearer?[1]<br/>
<br/>
Would it be fair to say that both concepts relate strongly to the "my guy" notion?  That, in essence, you push from the authority you have over your character (or as gamemaster), and you pull into the shared space?  I can see exceptions, so it's not a perfect coupling, but it seems pretty strong.  Unless I completely misunderstand.<br/>

I'd say that if there is a link it is only because games have historically only given authority to people in the context of their characters. As you need authority to push, you needed to do it from your character. However, in any game in which you have authority in other ways (many of the Forge games, for example) you can push or pull from many different places.                        </div>

                            bq. As for terms, they are what they are. We can talk about that after we know for sure what everyone is talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I kind of obsess about taxonomy.  And for me, being able to talk about what the name of a thing means helps a lot in understanding it.  If assert and solicit would be as-good names for push and pull, then I feel like I've got some kind of handle on the idea.  I can even install little lexical filters that will convert back and forth for me.<br/>

In reference to Push-Pull v. My Guy<br/>
bq. As for "my guy" -- I'd say only as a historical accident.<br/>
<br/>
bq. Judson, no, because GM's can push and pull too.<br/>
<br/>
I did mention the GM using his authority as GM to push and pull.  More obviously I think I didn't express my thought very well.  Sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm wondering is this.  In some games, there's a strong player authority over their character that I've come to refer to as "my guy"[1].  In that kind of game, "the world" is the GM's "guy."  There's a varying amount of neutral fiction that everyone can play around in.  In that kind of game, I would assume that:<br/>
<br/>
* players (GM included) push from their characters either into the neutral fiction or into other characters.<br/>
* players (GM included) pull into the shared space or their characters.<br/>
* pushes from the neutral fiction are possible if shaky.<br/>
* pushes from or pulls to other player's characters are usually forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
Am I completely off base here, or is that kind of accurate?<br/>
<br/>
fn1. I don't think I'm alone in this.  I certainly don't claim an authorship on the idea.                        </div>

(or, as I see it, Pull attempts to leverage authority - it turns one kind of authority into another kind. But that's premised on a different conception of authority than I think is in play here.)                        </div>

                            Alright, ban lifted, talk away.  Here's some thoughts, though:<br/><br/>First off:<br/><br/>Jonathan opened up discussion way more to the public (in an arena with more viewers, and without registration hassles) over here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/05/mo_brings_the_e.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.20by20room.com/2006/05/mo_brings_the_e.html</a><br/><br/>If you're going to Bring Down the Pain on the discussion of Push/Pull, might we take it over there? Personally, I'd be much more comfortable with that. Use 20by20 as the Re-engineering Zone and then come back here for tea, crumptes and Putting Push/Pull into the game.<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>1) I'm not comfortable with S-G as "The new place to discuss theory".  If it's not Craft, if it's not applicable to the table, if arguments go off in areas where they are no longer attached to the gaming experience, this isn't the place.  I skim a lot, and leave a lot of room open, but I will drop the hammer if we get too far out of line.  So far, this whole Push/Pull thing seems tied enough to the gaming table, and possibly design implementation (worth discussing, anyway) to warrant more talkies.<br/><br/>2) Keep it civil. <br/><br/>3) <b>Address the people that you are talking to by name or handle when you discuss their points. </b> This appears to be a big point of upset for some people, so please follow through with it for the duration of theory/craft discussion on this issue.<br/><br/>4) If things get too out of hand, here is the zippo I will use to burn this thread to ashes:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://shop.fujitv.co.jp/daiba/event/wannai_zippo/image/zippo5_1.jpg"/><br/><br/>Moderate Yourselves. Do not make me moderate with Fire, please.<br/><br/>5) This isn't an arena, it's a community. Remember, I've got all that crazy Japan culture shit up in here, so I err on the side of "the good of the people" over "the will of the one". So again, say and discuss how you will, but if the community begins to suffer for it, there'll be repurcussions whichever side of the fence you sit on.<br/><br/>Uh.... that's it for now?<br/><br/>Thanks all!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hey, Mo.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote to you about this in e-mail.  What about situations where I am asserting my authority to solicit input?  For instance, as a GM in Bliss Stage, I might very well go "Okay, this interlude isn't getting anywhere... Mo, can you move things forward faster?"<br/>
<br/>
That seems to be a assertion of my authority at the social level and a solicitation for input on the creative level, simultaneously.<br/>

                            Ben,<br/><br/>Although it is probably easier to work with the reasonably clearly definable cases, I think that there are definitely hybrid and borderline cases as well, so it is certainly possible to use an assertion of authority to solicit a contribution (indeed, you pretty much have to have the authority to solicit an input in order to pull).<br/><br/>As well as your example, look again at Mo's pull example <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. Mo starts her pull by asserting that her heroine locks up the villainess and is <i>certain</i> that she won't escape (wink wink). If Mo hadn't had the authority to assert that her character took that action, then she could not have pulled off that particular pull.<br/><br/>Likewise, TonyLB's examples (in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=657&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this </a>thread a while back) of pull that consist of using push to solicit a push back are (in my opinion) also discussable as pulls. While I think that this has the potential to make the terminology confusing, I also think that it is an important characteristic of certain interactions to recognize (a game in which someone is using strong assertions primarily to create a solicitation for input from another player will be different from a game in which all the players are making strong assertions primarily to enforce their will on the game, in that the first game has a complex mixture of push-pull, while the second is straight up push-push).<br/><br/>Mo,<br/><br/>I think this is a very good boiling down of push/pull, both in definition and in getting into why it matters. Thanks!<br/><br/>Charles S (alephnul in lj-land)                        </div>

<p>Mo, thanks very much for the definitions, and for having brought this subject to light in the first place.  Rock on!</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear your take on whether your definitions of Push and Pull allow for a single action to do both.  I totally get that Chris has given an answer ("No") but I was hoping that this thread would help us minimize the whole "multiplicity of voices and definitions" thing, so if you'd even just rubber-stamp Chris's opinion with Mo's official seal of approval (or, conversely, say "Push and Pull can happen at the same time" or "I have no opinion on whether Push and Pull can happen at the same time") that'd be ever so helpful in further discussions of how the terms are actually defined.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

                            Mo -- ah...<br/>
<br/>
Bliss Stage, actually, the GM can't make you go faster.  But in other games you can.  For instance, in Nine Worlds, I commonly do things like say "Okay, I won that conflict, so Mo, you just keep playing Herakles and we'll see where things go.  What do you do?"  And you can't (within the game rules) say no to that.<br/>
<br/>
And that would be a push, right?  The key is whether or not you can blow me off.  Even if it is totally wide open for your input, if you can't ignore it it's a push.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  *And* in games where narrative control is constantly and explicitly defined (The Pool, Dust Devils, Under the Bed, Nine Worlds), you are never allowed to blow me off.                        </div>
