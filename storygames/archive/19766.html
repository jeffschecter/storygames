Indie+ would like to invite you to play some games over Google+ Hangouts. We have two show-up-and-play events happening this Saturday the 27th, where we'll be playing <b>Remember Tomorrow</b>, <b>Lady Blackbird</b>, <b>Kagematsu</b> (modern setting), and <b>Apocalypse World</b>. These are teaching games, you don't have to know anything about them to play. We'll teach you the system and give you everything you need. Here's how you get in:<br/><br/>1) Check out the event pages. You can see which games are being played at what times.<br/>First session: <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c6vdp2kcvndm4nme9l2ns1ppanc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/events/c6vdp2kcvndm4nme9l2ns1ppanc</a><br/>Second session: <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/caerihqp9sfb4f7o1bf9iol07n4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/events/caerihqp9sfb4f7o1bf9iol07n4</a><br/>2) Click "Yes" under "Are you going?"<br/>3) Sign in to Google (your Gmail or Youtube account should work for Google+ as well), or create a free Google account<br/>4) This is optional: leave a comment on the event saying which game you want to play!<br/>5) When the time comes, you'll receive a notification (the top right bell icon). Click "Join Hangout" on the notification or on the event page. You're in!<br/><br/>If you can't make it this time, there's a second game day on October 18th. We're always looking for people to run indie games for these events: message me (+Aaron Feild) or +Indie+ if you're interested.
