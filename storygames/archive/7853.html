I've not played it since I've picked up tips here at S-G about basically "hippying up" a traditional RPG in a way by doing things like:<br/><br/>Creating a Situation, making sure everyone is on board before making characters.<br/>Build a relationship map, stick to it<br/>And so on.<br/><br/>So now, it's all about finding the appropriate/cool situation, and keeping with it. Even then, Blue Planet is so diverse as to be horrifyingly spread out all over, so it might be hard to decide a thing to stick with (colonization, the frontier, frontier vs new arrivals/corporations, pirates vs cops, mafia vs new arrivals, mafia vs frontier, frontier vs the aboriginals, scientists vs the aboriginals, and so on). <br/><br/>But once you can narrow it down to a cool setup (you might want to create a thread to get suggestions, or just do it here), then build an R-Map and you're ready to play with the trappings of the setting.<br/><br/>Frex: Mafia sets up a strongport on an island. Early settlers (the PCs) and some new scientists (one of the PCs) already live there. They grudgingly accept their presence at first, but then the relationship turns sour. Just "shooting the bad guys in the makeshift port" isn't going to be good enough to get the mafia presence, they're going to have to do something deeper to get them off and stay off.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174062/#Comment_174062" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T07:54:02+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  7:54AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the setting of Blue Planet but I've never been too fussed about it's system<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we have a setting with lots of different factions, all working together and against each other (GEO, Corps, Gangs, Settlers, Mutant Animals, Dolphins etc - can't remember the exact names, its been a while) and that sort of setting screams 'COLD CITY' to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did play in one very cool single session game (you know, a great campaign start that never gets past the first session because of RL crap) where the players were all criminals from the Luna Colony on the run from the GEO.

The one BP campaign I ran was based around a love triangle set against the backdrop of large-scale poaching and feuding ecoterrorist organisations.  The situation is written up as <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Longshore_crew_Keepsake" rel="nofollow">What's happening in Keepsake</a>.  I keep mulling doing something with a bunch of prospectors that find a large LongJohn node, and all the vultures that flock around them to take control of it.  <br><br>I think you need to pick the system based on what you want to stress in the particular game you want to run.  But the default system is pretty good at keeping out of the way while preserving a 'feet of mud' gritty type feel.  <br><br>I also strongly recommend <a href="http://www.gameeire.com/Scenarios/ghanrahan.html" rel="nofollow">Gareth Hanrahan's scenarios on GameEire</a> as being excellent blood operas.

So if you are into that kind of thing it is great. The setting feels really grown up and inspired me to obsess about GM:ing it for a long time (and even actually run it a little).<br/><br/>Now, it's very hard for me to see that a full setting really is what anyone really needs for actually running a good game. But it surely helps the books being fun to read. I still read them when I happen to be in the same country as my books. And somehow I got a lot of plot inspirations every times I flipped the book, so I guess that's something.<br/><br/>As I remember the system it makes battle quite dangerous, which I think is the point. And I guess we talk about BP v2? I guess no one remembers v1 these days (it featured a quite different system, I believe).<br/><br/>But as some people have suggested above, it is a bit hard to run BP without starring yourself blind on the setting. It is very likely that either the GM or even one of the players just wants to explain the intricacies of the setting instead of telling a tight story. And I really hate when that happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You are not <em>reproducing</em> science fiction. You are making original science fiction. Because it's you and three friends at the table, you don't have to worry about copyright, but even so, the details in the sourcebooks will turn out to be contradictory to the much more appropriate setting you're creating on the fly, as setting creation is an ongoing process.</p>\n<p>It will be <em>yours</em>. And I guarantee it will be better for you that way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175563/#Comment_175563" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T10:40:44+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 10:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shock: once brought my pet turtle back to life, and can cure any hangover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
