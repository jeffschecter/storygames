                    Hey all.<br/><br/>I'm running a Vietnam-ish LARP this Sunday.<br/>The issue is, I don't have a system picked or developed yet.<br/><br/>What we're trying to have:<br/>-the scenario is that an important commander has been taken as a prisoner of war.<br/>-a small squad of 3-4 men is charged with finding the outpost he's held at, and retrieving him.<br/><br/>There is a GM (myself), 3-4 player characters, and 3-4 NPC characters.<br/><br/>The idea was to get "mission objectives". Simple cards which say "there is a prisoner being held at Location H".<br/>A Cool Thing would be to have 2-3 mission objectives you can go with at one time:<br/>"There is a prisoner held at Location H."<br/><br/>And Location H is my chickencoop, which doubles as a wired-in PoW building:<br/><a href="http://photobucket.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting" src="http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n72/joepub/Picture001.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>"Three guards are camped at Location B."<br/><br/>And maybe Location B is the creekbed.<br/><a href="http://photobucket.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting" src="http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n72/joepub/Picture010.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>When the party headed in the direction of a new location, the NPCs would set up for the next encounter. That sort of thing. It wouldn't be rigourously <br/><br/>Me and a friend were discussing using something simple like rock-paper-scissors as the core mechanic.<br/><br/>We also had this cool idea that people have HP, and that HP is measured in marbles.<br/>When you get shot (for say, seven marbles or something), you might fall to the ground wounded. You (or someone else) buries the marbles in the mud...<br/>The medic comes along. How healing works is he rummages around in the mud, and the marbles he retrieves you get to add back to your health. Maybe not all seven can be retrieved.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how the marble burying thing could work, but I know it'd be hella cool if it did.<br/><br/>So, anyways... with all that in mind... can some people:<br/>1.) Suggest a system to me.<br/><br/>2.) Suggest a way to adapt a system so that it's cool.<br/><br/>3.) Suggest a way to run it freeform (never done this, don't know how it'd work in a confrontational setting)<br/><br/>4.) Help throw out ideas for mechanics and stuff, and we homebrew a system for me to use.<br/><br/>This is my first foray into LARPing (excluding drama and improv), and any help is much appreciated.                </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Hey all.<br/><br/>Me and a friend were discussing using something simple like rock-paper-scissors as the core mechanic.</blockquote>
LARP's with firearms are very, very hard to run, systemwise - LARP's with stealth and firearms mixed (as I suppose this one would be) are even more so. Systems like RPS tend to very bad at it, since they cancel out the stealth element and block the firefight with long resolution. Long-range firearms fire pretty much cancels the use of RPS as well - and a lot of other systems as well. Negotiation/bidding -systems are clunky to use when you're shooting from cover, a vast distance away from someone.
<blockquote>We also had this cool idea that people have HP, and that HP is measured in marbles.<br/>When you get shot (for say, seven marbles or something), you might fall to the ground wounded. You (or someone else) buries the marbles in the mud...<br/>The medic comes along. How healing works is he rummages around in the mud, and the marbles he retrieves you get to add back to your health. Maybe not all seven can be retrieved.</blockquote>
This sounds very cool; another possibility might be that the marbles are hidden in players clothing; to cure a X point wound, you'd have to find so many marbles. That would ensure that the medic is actually working with the players body, not digging earth.
<blockquote>3.) Suggest a way to run it freeform (never done this, don't know how it'd work in a confrontational setting)</blockquote>
I'll try to tackle this one. <br/><br/>I'd use pre-determined results for fighting. Maybe dealing several playing cards for the players - when in firefight, player checks his "fate-cards" - if it's red, shot misses, if it's black, it's a hit. The number on the card could be used for calculating the severity of the hit, or that could be left for player decision. Players can pretty much handle these things by themselves, judging the severity of the hit by factors like ranger, if it's stray fire, etc. The cards could also be used as a kind of meta-level resource to add suspense to the characters; a player getting a black card could have a bad feeling about this particular mission, sense of doom, and act according to it.<br/><br/>As for the scenario, I'd focus on the physical enviroment. LARP is a very physical medium and in action-oriented wargame that should be the focus. You won't probably have much discussion and little social aspect; being in jungle, doing special forces -kind of stuff is the central point. So, if possible, I'd use a lot of time for transition between the "hotspots" and guide the players to do the stuff they've seen in war movies and tv-series. One man to the point, slow going, watching out for mines (excellent opportunity for propping, here), etc.<br/><br/>For the hot spots, I'd drop the use of resolution mechanics, in mentioned way. Again, concentrating on the physical aspects; getting close to enemy unseen (and noting the NPC players that they really shouldn't be too alert), killing silently, and so on. One way of using this could be that if the encounter at the first guard post ends up in firefight, the guards at the actual base are more alert because they hear the shots. If the characters manage to do everything silently, the guards in base are more relaxed.<br/><br/>Something like that.                        </div>

That sounds that it could work very well. You might want to think out a way of putting the playing cards in some place they can be drawn quickly when the player is, say, lying behind a bush. Alternatively, they could have drawn some cards in advance, to know what happens with next few shots - but this is something that the players might not feel comfortable with as it's kind of fateplaying. If you want to go freeformish way, the resolution should happen quickly and the focus should be in the intensity of the firefight.
<blockquote>If they are in need of a medic, they take the marbles out of their bag and hide them on their person.<br/>This requires having lots of pockets, a satchel, etc, etc.<br/>The medic finds the marbles, and hands them back to the character.</blockquote>
This could work well, if the marbles can be hidden fast enough, like when the player is rolling around in pain and yelling the medic. In this sense, dropping them to ground might actually be easier and faster. I suggest trying this one out beforehand.
<blockquote>Stealth kills (sneaking up with a knife) require no mechanics. It's just "I stab you, mo fo."</blockquote>
Absolutely. Same could be used for shooting in point-blank range; if the shot is sure to hit and it's aimed, it could be handled as a clear kill for NPC's and maybe a fixed amount of marbles for a PC (like all of them).
<blockquote>At each hot spot you complete, you get an event card.</blockquote>
It might be cool to use a mixture of props and event cards; if the cards dictate where the players should go next, you might want to put a map into NPC's pocket and attach an event card. The map would point to the base, the event card could dictate that "the base seems to be three kilometers away; advance in jungle for an hour before arriving to place X." Or: "If you search for footprints, you'll eventually find an used path leading somewhere; advance in jungle for an hour before arriving to place X".<br/><br/>Edit: With the event card hid somewhere in ground near the guards, so the players have to search around for it. Or two event cards, one if the guard suggesting find footprints, and a second one hid somewhere near.                        </div>

Yeah, that could be difficult. And it would require every outfit having lots of pockets.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a better solution:<br/>The player counts out the marbles, and tosses them on the ground.<br/>Now, they have a decision: lay down and yell "medic!" or keep moving.<br/><br/>If they keep moving those marbles are lost.<br/>If they wait for the medic, they might miss out on action. Or worse, another NPC might advance and shoot at them while they are wounded.<br/><br/>The medic comes, and grabs as many marbles as he/she is willing to waste time collecting. The thing is, the player isn't allowed to say how many marbles were lost.<br/><br/>If the medic heard the NPC/PC yell out "I drew a seven" and thus knows that 7 marbles lay scattered then that's fine, I suppose...<br/>But if the medic didn't hear, then he/she has to guess at how many are still left behind.<br/><br/><br/>Props will be big, don't worry.                        </div>

I think this sounds like a working solution. Does the NPC/PC have to yell out what he drew? If the card dictates if the character is or is not hit, and if hit, how much damage he takes, there's no reason to yell out the result. The fact that a character is hit could be noted to other characters nearby with a cry of pain and medic, if wanted. Characters far away don't have to notice this; not knowing if you hit or not adds suspense. <br/><br/>Some additions that might or might not be too clunky:<br/><br/>- If there's enough damage, the character passes out, being only able to utter the some kind of grunt or yell of pain. Other characters will have to keep an eye for their buddies, this way. (And the other characters get to yell "Medic!" which is always cool)<br/>- Bleeding; if there's enough damage, the wounded character's player tosses a marble to ground every half a minute until the medic has arrived and has found a pre-determined amount of marbles - in other words, has stopped the bleeding.<br/>- The medic could be required to patch the wound with real bandage. This would probably need some kind of pointer with which the wounded player could dictate where he has been hit. Simply saying it works, of course.                        </div>

Yes. That would take out the cumbersome resolution and negotiation phase; with cards (you wiggle with cards, put in more or less red ones, and larger or smaller cards depending on how lethal you want the combat to be) the resolution can be set on the receiving end only, and you don't have to break the illusion of firefight with out of game comments and messages.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about the fate-card system for a while, because it would streamline things even more and would empower the players to make decisions. If the players would only receive a card that would tell them if their characters are having bad or good luck, they could decide when and how they get hit based on the situtation where the firefight occurs. Thus, if they get a bad luck card and later stumble into the enemy standing up, in the open, they could decide that they get hit really badly. With good luck card, they could decide that they only get a flesh wound. If, on the other hand, they have a bad luck card and are well covered, they could decide that they get a flesh wound from stray fire; with good luck card, no hit. This would remove the element of needing to dictate whom you are shooting; if the groups are further away from each other, camouflaged, taking cover, et cetera, it could hard to tell whom you are shooting. Also, the shouting could be replaced with firecrackers or some safe devices that go bang.<br/><br/>I haven't tested this out, just played with the idea, though. Obviously, this kind of system does not take into account character skill when it comes to shooting. In messy jungle firefight this could probably be taken into account by giving the NPC's worse cards and maybe some kind of rule for aimed shots. Here one could use shouts like "Bob, aimed shot to head" or maybe beamers or some other marking things to notify that someone has been targeted and hit.
<blockquote>How about this:<br/>If you draw an Ace or a Face Card, you are unconscious.<br/>Ace still deals one marble damage, face cards still deal 11, 12 and 13 respectively.</blockquote>
That would work out well, I think.
<blockquote>A tube of fake blood, some gauze and bandages?</blockquote>
I was thinking the same. Fake blood is usually a damned thing to clear after the game, but if the whole game is played outside, it could work very well. Add a drop of pig blood, or something similar, for smell. Also, for adding extra feeling, propping (previously wounded NPC soldiers) with minced meat and other assorted foodstuff is a very icky way of doing real-looking wounds.                        </div>

Yep; that's why using long time to move from hotspot to hotspot for characters would be very handy; you could prop the new hotspot area (or re-prop one used already) and NPC's. That would, of course, depend on how large the playing area is and how long walks the players could make without needing to move in very small circles. I don't know if it would be a good idea to use pre-made routes for characters; mark the path with something nearly invicible and tell them to follow tracks. And slowly walk though these routes beforehand to see how long time it takes to move from hotspot to other.<br/><br/>And, as an added bonus, the player characters can make snide commnets about every vietkong soldier looking the same. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Yeah, we have about 6 acres to work with, but only 2 which have REALLY defined terrain pieces (the trench, the bog, the chickencoop, etc).                        </div>
