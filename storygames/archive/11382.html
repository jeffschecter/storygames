You know the constellation of gigawatt deuterium-fluoride laser satellites we all put in orbit as doomsday weapons? They appear to have networked and reached some consensus on revised operational orders. Now we are so screwed!<br/><br/>In short, they are pruning technology by firing on and vaporizing any EM spectrum emitter between certain frequencies. We think 1cm to 1km but nobody is rigorously testing the upper and lower bounds, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Our dumb robot masters are wiping out all advanced technology, all power production, all radio sources, everything cool and fun. What's left?  I'm wondering what the practical implications of this are for we humans on the ground. <br/><br/>And, more importantly, how do we knock them out of the sky?<br/><br/>Typed on a manual typewriter,<br/><br/>Jason                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Pull out the spare gigawatt deuterium-fluoride laser you kept around as a spare in case something broke on a satellite (you had a spare, right? Parts at least?).  Strap a totally-non-electrical  telescope to the side of the laser, as parallel to the barrel as you can get (this is important).  Aim the laser at the visible glints off of the satellite, then as quick as humanly possible turn on the laser and shoot the satellite down before it tracks you.

Thus, you may not need to shoot them down if you can get them to shoot each other down. You can likely accomplish that by disrupting their communications. <br/><br/>Submarine-launched nuclear missiles are an excellent attack vector. Purely ballistic missiles such as the submarine-launched Trident-series ICBM have minimal onboard electronics, no active EM emitters such as tracking or communications systems, and existing electronics are well-shielded - these things need to survive sub-orbital re-entry, after all. Furthermore, even if detected, shooting down an ICBM in-flight is a very low-probability maneuver. <br/><br/>The nuclear payload poses a triple-threat to the satellites: the explosion could destroy satellites directly (least likely scenario), indirectly destroy or cripple via EM pulse (very plausible), or promote satellite friendly-fire through communication disruption via EM pulse (unknown probability). <br/><br/>Submarines themselves are essentially immune to orbital laser attack, provided that they do not foolishly surface. Seawater strongly interferes with any signal that might betray the submarine's precise location to an orbital sensor. Moreover, submarines are already designed for stealth, and thus already seek to minimize EM signatures. Finally, seawater forms a virtually impenetrable barrier to orbital laser attack. Since the missiles can be launched underwater and since modern submarines have a number of ways of communicating without surfacing, both coordination with remaining command and the attack itself can occur without risk to the sub.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253408/#Comment_253408" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T08:22:35+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  8:22AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think the elaborate underground lair type plans may be more wishful thinking than practical - you'd need to fab every component on site.

The EM emission is low power (though I wish I knew more specifics).<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark-gap_transmitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark-gap_transmitter</a><br/><br/>Likewise, leakage from a Faraday cage would have very limited range. Our robot masters could utilize ground-based drones to seek out sources undetectable from space and relay firing coordinates. Bear in mind that you can't call out of a Faraday cage either (well, not using EM waves).<br/><br/>Running power from a shielded power source requires shielded wires. That's okay, people do that in the lab all the time, but well-shielded cabling can be expensive. Coaxial cable should do the trick to shield from orbital distances, though. Then you just have to worry about leakage at contact points. We could communicate between Faraday cages using shielded wire connections.<br/><br/>First, though, we'd need to shield the very construction plants used to make the wire mesh, metal foil, metal plates and what-not that we want to use to make the Faraday cages.

We already shut down satellites when a solar flare is predicted, and the radiation and particles nevertheless knock out properly-deactivated satellites. At best, shutting down gives you slightly better odds. Finally, this only protects more distant satellites for which there is room and time to act between first detection and the full measure of the destructive front.

With that question covered, let's discuss other satellite vulnerabilities and other ways to overcome our own.<br/><br/>Our Communcations:<br/><br/>Our communications issues can be solved with shielded cable, as Quentin detailed. However, as noted above, this requires demanding infrastructure investments if it is to be used over long range. <br/><br/>Buried electric lines already have some shielding by virtue of being buried, and could be used to supplement such a network. <br/><br/>Fiber optic lines are completely safe from the satellite targeting parameters. Intercontinental communications already occur via undersea fiber optic lines, and so that's a solved problem, and the communications backbones of industrialized nations are also mostly fiber optic.<br/><br/>Laser-based communications provide another avenue: directional, secure, relatively high-bandwidth, simple (MAKE magazine had a build project on the topic), and capable of long range with adequate power. A diesel generator in an enclosed metal shed later and you're set. <br/><br/>The LF band and lower bands provide another option, and this solution is easily implemented by modifying existing equipment.<br/><br/>Their Weaknesses: <br/><br/>Remaining in a stable orbit is a challenge for these satellites. A 1 terawatt beam fired for 1 second emits 1 terajoule of energy. This imparts a photon momentum of p = E/c to the satellite, or about 3,300 kg*m/s of momentum. This is equivalent to firing 5 kilogram mass (11 pounds) at twice the speed of sound. In other words, <i>this thing kicks like an artillery piece.</i> <br/><br/>To compensate, the satellite must take action to correct its orbit. Shots straight down (or up) are of no consequence, but any shot in any other direction will perturb the satellite out of orbit. Most problematic are shots at a target in the forward 180 degrees of arc along the satellite's direction of motion. Such shots will serve to slow the satellite down, thus degrading its orbit. A shot at a horizon target along the direction of motion is the worst realistic case.<br/><br/>This becomes a potential attack strategy when combined with the fact that these are satellites, arrayed in a particular fashion and in particular, known (or knowable) orbits. Deliberately providing targets in such a fashion as to bias the satellites to slow themselves down and knock themselves out of orbit is not difficult. Of course, the satellites presumably have maneuvering jets to correct themselves, but these have a finite fuel supply - a fuel supply that, given the large recoil of each shot, will be exhausted quickly. As we shall see shortly, correcting one shot with another opposing shot would not be a good strategy, nor would emitting half the beam in the opposing direction to make the shot recoil-free. <br/><br/>Another weakness is recharge time. I assume these satellites are not solar-powered, as gathering a terajoule of power from solar cells is impractical for such a weapon: incoming solar flux on the sunlit side of the earth averages 680 W m-2. A satellite would thus require a mind-blowing square kilometer of perfectly efficient solar panels to recharge in a mere half hour. Clearly, an on-board reactor is required. However, the biggest nuclear sub ever launched had "only" 380 megawatt power output. A satellite launched with such an absurdly huge reactor system would manage a 1 second shot every 45 minutes or so. <br/><br/>Thus, the satellite network can be swamped easily, and cannot viably use laser shots for navigation nor "recoil-free shots" due to the strategic cost. Before an attack such as a nuclear missile launch, simply switch on a series of decoys or actual real-value sacrifice targets around the globe. Either something gets shot at, creating a chink in the robot overlord armor, or nothing gets shot at - which means you are safe to operate, as the robot holds itself in reserve for defense against attack. Congratulations, you now have a Cold War scenario. <br/><br/>Finally, going further afield: \n<ul>\n<li>the satellites exist in an orbit that is susceptible to plasma injection. Any plasma that gets injected into the magnetosphere tends to remain in fixed bands due to the "bottling" effect. A carefully calculated, large injection of plasma at, say, the north pole could flood the satellite orbital region with enough free ions to destroy both detection mechanisms and actual electronics.</li>\n<li>Various anti-satellite weapons have been researched around the world, and some could probably be pressed into service.</li>\n<li>Thunderstorms provide a large zone of safety, through which the robot cannot see with its antenna eyes.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253470/#Comment_253470" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T11:14:24+00:00" title="January 28, 2010 11:14AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, that is fantastic. <br/><br/>Thing is, this was all spelled out in the white paper delivered to the High Laserbot Council, and they are demanding an effective countermeasure to the inevitable human attack as outlined.

It takes 2.6 kilojoules of energy to boil 1 gram of room-temperature water. Thus, 1 terajoule of energy can boil about 380 million grams of water, or 380 thousand liters. That sounds like a lot, but it's only 1/6 of an Olympic-sized swimming pool - trivially done. So, you can boil a lot of water by tricking the satellites into shooting at the right places. Virtually every power plant of every kind in the world boils water to spin their generators. Salvage a generator, find a water supply, and you have the makings of both ablative shielding and electricity.<br/><br/>edit: mind you, I'd rather nuke the suckers immediately and be done with it, as that strategy is essentially impossible to counter.

I think you mean that a detonation outside of a certain range would have a high survival probability - maybe detonations outside X hundred kilometers have a 65% survival rate or somesuch, while Y hundred kilometers has a 95% survival rate.<br/><br/> If they're immune to a multi-megaton warhead going off in their face, then they're immune to all forms of attack entirely, including kinetic kill vehicles such as railguns. Under this scenario, our only options are communications warfare such as hacking or "denial of service" type flooding, becoming immune to their attacks entirely, or an attrition-based strategy such as running them out of fuel.<br/><br/>edit: which is not to say that "arbitrary immunity to direct physical attack" is uninteresting. It is certainly a bigger challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253537/#Comment_253537" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T13:55:01+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  1:55PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2010 1:56PM by Eric.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>These could be clever enough to shut down ones in danger before the missiles were even near (rather than detecting radiation).

That said, for the sake of the thought experiment, sure, lets say that they can go into safe mode well before detonation. <br/><br/>That creates its own opening, though, right?

The U.S. Air Force actually has had competitions between missile crews to see who can hit at an arbitrary target most accurately. Missiles must be able to hit anywhere on the face of the globe, and also potentially airburst at a launch-specified height. Between the two, you can detonate pretty much anywhere in the flight path. I'm not sure if you can detonate during ascent, but that's about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253545/#Comment_253545" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T14:23:31+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  2:23PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2010 2:24PM by akooser.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...they're immune to a direct hit with a nuclear weapon? <br/><br/>Not immune it's just unlikely to damage a hardened orbital platform.

The Trident II missile system has a listed accuracy of 120 meters without the aid of GPS, so it's really a question of how high up the targets are and what the effective kill radius is for each warhead (the Trident II packs warheads of either 100kT or about 500kT each, with up to 12 warheads per missile but more likely 4-5 warheads due to treaty limits). Naturally, you also have underground silos and the like, which boast substantially larger payloads. The Russians have some ungodly huge warheads that they might be able to get airborne. <br/><br/>So, at this point, I think the nuclear option has reached the point that real numbers would be needed to calculate the breaks. That seems beyond the parameters of an SG thread, so maybe call it good and think about a no-nuke scenario?<br/><br/>edit: about the altitude issue: those "in-orbit spares waiting at 600km" are completely toast, no problem. A typical launch trajectory for a Trident II hits an altitude of about 1000 km, so to missile actually goes above these guys, separates, and ideally each MIRV goes after a satellite, each with 120 meter accuracy. What about the non-spares? If they're up with the GPS system at 20,000 km, we're hosed, but it's an immense pain to get such a big thing that high up. If they're around the spares, they're also toast. In between, then it depends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253564/#Comment_253564" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T15:47:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  3:47PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>A strike within 10km of an orbital station would produce about 4000 Roentgen (from a 20kT nuke) radiation intensity. 500 Roentgen kills meat bags.</blockquote>\nAren't we poor sods on the ground already suffering fallout from blown up nuclear power stations the satellites hit on their first pass?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253631/#Comment_253631" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T02:11:11+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:11AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm pretty sure team laser did mean they were hardened against intense radiation, making a near miss not good enough.

UK submarine missiles are not targetted in advance. I assume the same applies to the US. They are accurate to 10m, and they can be programmed to detonate at any point in their trajectory, for air bursts and EMP pulses. However, the designers of the orbital lasers knew all this stuff. Also, although they can blow stuff up, they are a network. I suspect they'd be good at designing viruses and hacking bank computers, perhaps disabling defence computers, or getting bad components into submarines years in advance, before they launched their attack?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253653/#Comment_253653" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T06:36:57+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  6:36AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elenius</cite>Sounds a lot like the plot of Sean McMullen's Greatwinter trilogy <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>\nI was thinking the exact same thing.

This means that they'll be knocking out only hundreds of targets per day. Assuming that high EM emitters are top of the list, this means that the satellites will be taking months in simply destroying radio antennae and large power plants (how much external leakage do those have, anyway?), and assuming that people make efforts to keep up some sort of electricity-generation, it'll be years before they might go for something as small as a car. We're talking hundreds of thousands of significant targets, and every target is smaller (and more replaceable) than the last. Anybody have any good numbers on whether those satellites can actually dent anything but the largest concentrated infrastructure installations, or are they doomed to being swamped by the largest 1% of EM emitters while we use the remaining 99% to keep the civilization intact and work on a solution?<br/><br/>Of course losing that most important 1% still means utter chaos in major metropolises and other high-strung logistical centers around the world, but there are many things that won't be impacted by the satellites directly: military installations (not known for their EM output, really), laboratories (often have their own back-up electricity orders of magnitude smaller than anything the satellites would fire at, assuming they go solely by signal strength), my house (doesn't use electrical heating), and anything smaller than a major power plant or electricity network hub, really. It is likely that we'll lose the Internet and many other services highly dependent on EM output (radio stations, I imagine, would go up first) or reliable electricity, but what remains would still constitute the majority of the world continuing to work normally. For instance, any estimations for how long the satellites will take to get through blowing up all the major EM emitters in Central Europe? Could be that they'd take months or years to get to Finnish targets in their kill list, if they'd ever do.<br/><br/>Even if the scale issue is only just about considerable instead of overwhelming like I paint up above, it still seems to me that unless the satellites can choose their targets intelligently or they have absolutely overpowering advantage, it should be possible to swamp their firepower with false signal operations. Powerful EM emitters are absolutely trivial to build when you get down to it, and if the satellites really can fire only a few hundred shots a day all together, it doesn't seem that impossible to simply manufacture more emitters than they have shots available. A single well-organized workshop (not talking of a factory, even) can already put out hundreds of these things a day, so we just need electricity, somebody to drive them to distant locations and some replaceable wiring - then it's just a matter of taking the hit and installing a replacement until the satellites lack the power to continue firing.<br/><br/>I'd say that the conclusion here must be that the satellites have a higher-order intelligence controlling them, something with complex strategic goals and a more complex heuristic than simple EM signal strength. Considering that, I'd have to conclude that it must be possible to negotiate with whoever is controlling the satellites - if they have the intelligence for strategic priorization, they'll have strategic goals, and if they have that, then they have needs of some sort. Thus they should have something they need, and maybe we could provide that without such a destructive war. Even better, the odds are that the somebody controlling the satellites is here on Earth - so I'd say that the priority number dos (right after setting up the various Faraday cages, false signal interference, portable power generators and other logistics) is to find the brain of this operation and blow him out of the water. My money, for the record, is on the Morningstar - he knows suspiciously much about what's going on, and I don't find his cover story about a networked AI that believable, considering the facts on the ground.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253804/#Comment_253804" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T12:26:19+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 12:26PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, I swear to God I am not in league with these ... <i>death robots.</i> Come on.

I'm not sure why I'm still writing in this. It's been 3 weeks since the grid was taken down. Once the hysteria passed and word got around that the satellites were only killing "advanced" technology, even the crazy seemed to take care of it's own. We're all going to be OK. I even thought that the satellites, for what ever reason were like an Old Testament Almighty, up close and personal after such a long time away, and now He's back to smiting the wicked with lasers. I'm just writing this... I don't know.<br/><br/>This is the bad part. I've been thinking all night. Thinking <i>hard</i>. Today we're going into the cellar and there's only a dozen cans of Grindley's left. It's not like in that show with the nuclear bombs and people dying in the streets. Yes, we've had some accidents and the hospital on Cherry Street couldn't run the surgery stuff or heart monitors. But we're all mostly here (I don't know about New York or other big cities- we hear different things). The point is, there's still a lot of people still alive and they are hungry.<br/><br/>Last week one of the SHP troopers walked into town. He said he had been walking for maybe 10 days. He was in pretty bad shape, of course. I found out because he died yesterday and Jeff asked me to keep track of his name. Officer Brad Utz, from Morganton. UTZ, Like the potato chip. Jeff said that Utz remembered that most of the gas pumps were dry, even the working ones, as far as the interstate. He was about 30 miles from the air force base when it was fried. He'd walked south, trying to get home - but Morganton is east - maybe he had a girlfriend? Anyways, Utz also mentioned that he hadn't seen any trucks on the roads since the 24th. That's about 2 weeks ago.<br/><br/>You know, a lot of people laughed at us when we moved out here and you started that homesteading thing. Why didn't we learn more? Because that's the thing that scares me. No more trucks. That video of that guy who was trying to tell people to be ready. What'd he say? 3 days of food in every store. We have so many farms here, I know. It's like a food wonderland. A lot of people still jar food. They did anyways. <br/><br/>I know Jeff said it too. How are we going to plow the winter barley? Who's going to plow the spring crops? They are not going to enough horses. Do they still use horses... oxen? I'm not a farmer, Jenny. Your garden is a mystery. What's going to happen to all those people? I found this pamphlet at the Flyway, next to the MiracleGro stand, and there's this chart where they show corn yields from 1930 and 1990. There's 5 times as much on the right side than the left. But we had working tractors and trucks. There are no more working tractors or trucks. No more trains. If we can grow it, who will buy it and move it. It's impossible.<br/><br/>Sorry I smudged this. Like I said, I'm scared now. Some of the guys want to start a "patrol" like some western, and keep an eye on the roads. It's really a good idea - some day all those people who can are going to leave the city and start moving to the where the food is. And that's right here in flyover country.<br/><br/>It's a family day into town. Luke and Daniella are excited about seeing the library. Me too. I have some reading to do. Maybe see Jeff, jump on his bike, get some news. There's a chance that the clinic will need me again, even for whatever they can trade. We'll be home by dark. Please come home. Please.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253917/#Comment_253917" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T07:10:06+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  7:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2010 7:24AM by Eric.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>The Satellites have written a message in the desert in hundred-foot high letters that if so much as a SINGLE one of them falls as a result of action from the ground, they will collectively direct their fire at the Yellowstone Supervolcano and crack it open and it'll be your own fault.
