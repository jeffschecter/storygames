Some of them have lots of great info!<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/search.php?PostBackAction=Search&amp;Keywords=e6&amp;Type=Topics&amp;btnSubmit=Search" rel="nofollow"><b>A link to the search here!</b></a><br/><br/>So, the E6 hack for D&amp;D 3e fixed (by Ryan S aka <b>Ry</b> here at S-G, written long before he joined this site!) like 95% of the pressure and frustration that was keeping me from really enjoying D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I hear a lot of others loved E6 because they played D&amp;D from very low to very high levels, and the ability bloat/keeping track of everything was just too damn unwieldy and tiring. E6 fixes this! But it wasn't specifically my problem.<br/><br/>Others love E6 because it makes badass monsters badass. Instead of having a quest to kill the dragon, where all the characters level up to 20 then take out the dragon in a long, drawn-out combat, it required DMs to make creative adventures like, "adventure set 1: find the secret of the dragon by raiding temple; adventure set 2: recover the magical sword and arrows that were used in ancient times to take down this specific red dragon; adventure set 3: get in a position to take down the dragon through careful use of gathering/using limited story-centric magical items and weapons" etc. Not a problem I had with the ruleset (I stuck to mostly lower levels, highest character level in d20 was 13 IIRC), but I totally agree with the philosophy!<br/><br/>My particular problem was all the tactical character choices and career-pathing. I came back to the US in 2000 and had to reboot my career over from scratch, and every day was facing stressful choices about career decisions. Then when I played d20 to kick back and relax, I found metaphorically similar choices there, and it drove me nuts! <br/>Stuff like: I really want to play - conceptually - a Spirit Shaman/Thief. But because of the ability progression, it's just so much more sensical to just take one class instead of two. And if I want to use this powerful ability as fast as possible at level 12, I need to take these 2 feats at level 9, this feat at level 6 which lets me take that level 9 feat, etc, and thus I must take feats X, Y and Z at first level.<br/><br/>Since in E6 the level cap is 6 (but not feats, you can gain more later), that pretty much took away 90% of all that frustration with future planning, and helped me enjoy just playing what I wanted to play.<br/><br/>For a long while, Clinton N was running an E6 campaign in a sandbox environment: We took on both the roleplay aspects and also got big into the grid combat system. We played for several levels, and I had a blast! <br/><br/>4E has this built in to some degree with it's "Level 1-10 Tier"; you can just stay at that tier forever if you want. But I really like the limitations of E6: That hard imposing barrier (like any creative tourniquet) really makes for other creative decisions in both character direction and scenario/campaign creation. <br/><br/>I've had it on my mind recently, which is why I finally broke down and picked up Pathfinder, with the full intention of using it to run another E6 campaign at some point. Which as I mention in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15145" rel="nofollow">that recent 3.5e thread</a> is in general not exactly the best deal pricewise for gaming (prices be damned, it's just fucking fun and thus worth it in the end!) because you will only end up using about 20% of the corebook, if that. Which is why I would recommend finding Pathfinder used (ha! I tried for a long time before giving up; no one's reselling their books! At least, not for cheap anyway) or 3.5e books used.<br/><br/>Anyone else play E6?

Basically, levels 1-6 are pretty much exactly like regular D&amp;D, with the 6 level cap and gaining feats afterwards being the tricky rules bits.<br/>So if you have a pregen module for anywhere of a range of levels between 1 and 6, it should work with no problem! But if the path carries you beyond that, or starts at a level higher than 6, then yeah you likely need to hack it so much you might as well not even use it (or read it for ideas, then reconstruct the module in an E6-y kind of way; but totally not running it as-is).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344418/#Comment_344418" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T11:49:10+00:00" title="September 29, 2011 11:49AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, sorry, I meant "beyond level 6."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344422/#Comment_344422" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T12:11:05+00:00" title="September 29, 2011 12:11PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <i>really like</i> E6 in theory but in practice what prevents me from loving it is precisely the "20%" issue. It's irrational I guess but it really discourages me from playing E6 because it feels like saying "Ok, let's play this game but <i>ignore the vast majority of it</i>." Ironically enough, that is precisely what I find fun about D&amp;D and I really like the tone and aesthetics implied by E6. <br/><br/>I would love an E6 game that was rewritten from the bottom up with those assumptions, instead of cutting away part of a different game to make it conform to those assumptions.<br/><br/>I've had lots of ideas of how to keep dragons (for example) both really scary and not impossible to fight even by characters at (what by D&amp;D standards counts as) lower levels by tweaking just a few of the core mechanics a bit.
