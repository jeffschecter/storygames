Usually, people write the games they plan to run up on a whiteboard. We then all organize into games more or less on an as needed basis.  Every once in a while there's some downtime where people are sitting around twiddling their thumbs, but it generally works ok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322535/#Comment_322535" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T13:14:12+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  1:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...<br/><br/>How did it go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322539/#Comment_322539" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T13:50:04+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  1:50PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I drove up Saturday from Chicago with a friend as a day trip to see what it was like, and we both wished we could have stayed longer.  Hopefully next year I can make the whole weekend.  <br/><br/>Played three games, all for the first time: Hell 4 Leather, 3:16 and InSpectres.  <br/><br/>Hell 4 Leather was good, sick fun.  None of the six of us had played before, but we all seemed to pick it up pretty quickly.  The player with the Rider seemed to really be enjoying herself, which I think went a long way towards getting everyone into it.  <br/><br/>3:16: I still wonder if Cpl. JoJo shouldn't have just put Sgt. Dave down like a dog, just like he done for Jones.  <br/><br/>I ran InSpectres, despite having never played and having read the book just once over six months ago.  It was reeeeally easy to GM: just throw out a few NPCs and starting plot points, and let the players do the heavy lifting with their narrations.  It helped that one of the players was familar with the game, and everyone was kind enough to remind me to inflict Stress roles on them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322559/#Comment_322559" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T15:38:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  3:38PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell 4 Leather was halla fun, although the imagery on the tarot deck we had was not very "bad ass biker" inspiring, so our bad ass biker story....drifted in many strange ways.  Also the physical production of the game was gorgeous...I hope to see more really short games use that card stock quad fold brochure layout.  Its a perfect format for these sorts of games.<br/><br/>Also Remember Tomorrow is really really good.  I now want to play a campaign of it soon.  I'd seen it as part of the charity bundle but had only given it a first pass read so far, but man, some brilliant stuff to work with came out of a no prep "what are you going to run for us, Tim" session.  I'm sold.<br/><br/>Also it was fun to play Hero Scape again.  Despite a less than optimal army build that effectively wasted 150 points of my 500 point army (on a hero who never attacked or used his bonus even once) the charge of the Templars through the heart of the Merro army and out again ranks up there with the Riders of Rohan at the walls of Minas Tirith.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
