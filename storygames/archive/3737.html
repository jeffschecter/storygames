When someone needs to fill in the details of a school janitor, or an alien overlord, or anyone else who is <i>not</i> the focus character of any of the other players, this guy has the responsibility and authority to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey get (usually) broad ability to make up new characters at the drop of a hat, limited only by plausibility (and sometimes not even that).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is often folded in with the package of roles called "GM."  To me, though, this looks separable from many of the other roles.  This role of populating the world (which I'm going to call the "Chorus" role for the purposes of this thread) doesn't require (for instance) the ability to frame scenes.  It doesn't require the ability to be the arbiter of the rules.  It doesn't require most of the rest of the GM package.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow else can we play with this role?

Both in a spontaneous manner, when some PCs were not present ("Make some guys up who might be there.") and as a standard rule.<br/><br/><br/>As for the latter, one player was chosen to play the chorus and another was chosen to play nature (i.e. weather, light effects, scenery). The basic idea was to hand these jobs to someone else, because as a GM I tend to forget about them, when I have other GMing things to do. It worked reasonably well, although the same thing happened: The players forgot about nature and chorus, when they were engaged in their PCs.<br/><br/>But with the right players, I'd do it again. I know a few people who are just awesome in one of these aspects. <br/>\n<blockquote>What if nobody is filling the role?</blockquote>\nPlayers might start using monlogues. I've seen that in InSpectres, when we played it without a GM. Instead of meeting an NPC, players just phoned someone speaking for their character and making pauses, when the other person would speak. Then we explained to the other PCs, what we found out.<br/><br/>A friend of mine also made up an RPG that drew heavily from theatre. So there were a few places (i.e. stage make-ups) chosen in advance and a few characters. Others could not be introduced, so players would do all the classical tricks like looking out of a window describing what they saw, receiving letters etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83763/#Comment_83763" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T06:23:36+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  6:23AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><br/>What if<em>nobody</em>is filling the role?</blockquote>\nI think you could look at some LARPs and how they handle this.  Of necessity, NPCs tend to be downplayed or left out entirely in LARPs, because a GM can only play one at a time and such.  So a lot more of the game becomes about the PCs interacting and providing antagonism for one another.  This can work in tabletop settings, too.<br/><br/>Levi Kornelson's <a href="http://dustbowl-prophets.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Dustbowl Prophets</a>, for example, explicitly calls for minimizing the importance of NPCs and making PC interactions more important.  And reinforces this by rewarding escalating a PC relationship (all of which tend to lead toward conflict if sufficiently escalated).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83764/#Comment_83764" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T06:25:30+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  6:25AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I<i>haven't</i>seen (at least not anywhere near as often) the idea of giving someone other than the GM the authority to<i>invent</i>NPCs in order to play them. </blockquote>\nWe do this.  It's tricky, because when you get tagged to create a new NPC you don't want to come on so strong that it disrupts any of the elements of a scene.  Here's a good example:<br/><br/>In Contenders, Remi's guy goes to the evil crime boss, who is dying of consumption.  I say "The crime boss is hacking his lungs out, but you can talk to his lieutenant.  Clinton, Go!"  And Clinton comes up with a skeevy dude on the fly, connects him to the crime boss and Remi's guy, gives Remi a work scene, and it is all awesome.  That skeevy dude is established and returns over the course of the game.  I just sit back and cough a lot.<br/><br/>Here's a bad example:<br/><br/>We're playing Heroes Banner, and Clinton tags me to play one of the billow maidens, these nine underwater evil godling ladies.  So I get all evil (again on Remi, hmm) and billowy, and start describing things that we're going to do to Remi's guy if he doesn't get us this thing we want, that I then make up.  Basically adding a major plot point to the game and stealing focus from the giant evil dude that Clinton was playing.  And it turns out I went to far and it wasn't cool.<br/><br/>So in both cases the person with authority tagged another player to jump in and create an NPC out of whole cloth, but there's a fine line related to the now-shared authority when this happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83769/#Comment_83769" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T07:00:58+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  7:00AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>In Contenders, Remi's guy goes to the evil crime boss, who is dying of consumption.

For some time now I've been allowing pretty much any players in my games to introduce NPCs at just about any time.  When I ran Savage Worlds, I introduced a set of "meta-Bennies" which players could use to "change the scene" in some minor way.  Quite often, the players used them to introduce henchmen, bad guys, unexpected rescuers, and more.  Occasionally one would be used to create something more mundane, like a shopkeeper who had just the right item the player-character was seeking at that moment.<br/><br/>In the game I'm currently playtesting (Verses), the ability for players to introduce minor new characters is built into the resource-allocation mechanics, as are rules for using that same system to elevate these new characters (and old ones, too) to higher status (read: more useful attributes) within the current scene.  This can pretty much be done at any time by anyone before or after the dice are being rolled.<br/><br/>Then again, I must add that in Verses, I'm also running into a bit of gray when trying to decide what the GM-specific roles are, if any.

I like the use of chorus as roles. <br/>It helps the old problem of being bored when your PC's not present too.<br/>I've tried to work it into a few of my games.<br/><br/>Like Jason said, in <i>Contenders </i>all the players are expected to take up roles on the fly, the scene mechanics are fixed once the scene has been called or, so chorus can't alter the actual outcome of the scene. Strictly speaking the spotlight player (Remi in the example) has narrative authority at that moment. So it's a rolling authority, scene to scene (and controlled by the cards).<br/><br/>For <i>Piledrivers and Powerbombs</i> the chorus are more for crowd members who can alter the match by chanting. This works really well when the players get into it, I had an awesome con game where they all started making signs to hold up! Again it's a rotating veto power confined by structured scenes and obeying the cards. <br/><br/>But for my latest project <i>The Dragon vs The Gun</i>, I'm trying to get a full set of mechanics in place for Audience members to jump in with NPCs. Basically you can stake a point to bring in an NPC (you gain a point for a re-introduction) the NPC can help or hinder the PC(s) but not directly trigger Conflict Resolution. <br/><br/>Like Joshua pointed to, resource allocation supplanting the veto. <i>Universalis </i> and <i>Burning Empires</i> do it too I think and <i>Agon's</i> grizzly Grandpa <i>Rune</i>.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>JoE                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I can think of Capes - how there's no need for a GM.  Or Agon, where the GM has to work on a budget of Strife for a scene.  Those are the only examples that come to mind with specific mechanical rules (e.g. rules that have currency/dice/effectiveness behind them).</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I mean it's already there in Phasmaphobic's spec. If resources do what you want them to do, no arbitration will be necessary, which is good.</p>\n<p>Hackeysack in a collaborative game. The rules are simple: you can't use any body part lower than the elbow to touch the sack and everyone has to touch it at least before going back to the server. The more you do that, the awesomer.</p>\n<p>There are some ancillaries: being able to keep the thing going around your own body for a long time is cool. Keeping it for too long is being a jerk and showing off without other people being able to play. Rotate so one player doesn't always have the sun in their eyes. Don't take someone else's shot. Don't apologize when you miss and the bag hits the ground.</p>\n<p>With the exception of the "don't hold onto the sack for too long" rule, there's no judgment required. You collaborate. Sometimes players will give the benefit of the doubt when a suspicious part of the elbow gets used, but mostly, everyone follows the rules (with local variants, like the teenaged boy "if you drop it someone throws it at you hard" dickneckery). Sometimes, there's a dispute over whether someone's taken someone else's hit, but it's usually pretty obviousl What you're doing is clear.</p>\n<p>I want my games to be like hackeysack or soccer, and in neither game do your fellow refs or players get to say when something you did is valid. It either is, or it isn't. The ball is in bounds, or it isn't. You either kicked that guy or you didn't. The refs are there to observe that the rules are being followed (because the game is competitive and the interest of both teams is in lying in their own favor), or the fellow players keep you in check because you're fucking up the game for everyone by breaking them.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine that the refs in a game of soccer could judge on how good a goal was at awarded points accordingly. Suddenly, it becomes more like figure skating, where national rivalry interferes with judgment, where there are scandals about what the judges mean. This has become a game where you play the <em>ref</em>, not the rules.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
