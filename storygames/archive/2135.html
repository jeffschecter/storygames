                    This is a new topic for this older thread: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/1998/chatgame-shadow-of-2006-er-yesterday/#Item_22" rel="nofollow">Chat-gMe: Shadow of Yesterday</a>.  I apologize to everyone who showed interest: my holiday season got a little too crazy with family things for me to pull this off.  But I'm still up for it.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the deal:<br/>
Let's get together on Gabbly--the "Start Chat!" function here--on Friday, January 5, at 8 PM Eastern (=5 PM Pacific, =Sorry, Europeans), and talk about who wants to play whom.  This will give me some time to work out technical problems I might have with Skype, Teamspeak, or whatever.  (For me, the ideal platform is a mixture of voice-chat, typing, and dice rolling software.)<br/>
<br/>
The scenario I have in mind:<br/>
The World of Near, to begin with.  Specifically, Maldor -- the default assumption is that all characters are from Maldor unless there's a good reason why not.<br/>
<br/>
Maldor is the Forgotten Realms meets <i>Road Warrior</i> -- it's a post-apocalyptic nightmare of fantasy tropes.    When Good King Absolon left the world during the Sky-Fire, the royal line of succession was broken, and one hundred years later, every member of the aristocracy lays claim to the throne.  These aristocrats spy, feud, and wage war against one another--each asserting that he is the Second Coming of Absolon the Sun King.<br/>
<br/>
This divine heritage creates a cult of personality around each satrap or promising warlord: every peasant must labor for the ascendancy of their local messiah-count; the viziers and court of the messiah must sample and understand all the sins of this world before they can cleanse Maldor of iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
From the sidelines, revolutionary cells and the sinister Cult of the Shadow Moon threaten the power structure; these people are rooted out and exterminated mercilessly.<br/>
<br/>
The power structure is more ambivalent to the wizards of the Three Cornered School: some of these men are harmless charlatans who may be ignored; others are terrifying men of power.  The peasantry is superstitious, believing all such wizards in league with the Shadow Moon (sometimes justifiably).  Other wizards have joined the priesthood of the Warrior Messiah, using their spells against rival baronies, granted indulgences from their masters.<br/>
<br/>
The Situation:<br/>
So, what I have in mind is --<br/>
<br/>
<b>Count Roderigo</b> is a man of middle years, dark of hair, gentle of speech, and (in the eyes of his courtiers) of a divine and kingly mien.  He is married to <b>Countess Beatriz</b>, who is beautiful but hated by the peasantry, and served by <b>Archbishop Gediminas</b>, who urges everyone to do their all that Roderigo may ascend to the Ivory Throne of Absolon in time to vanquish the Hellbound Usurper and save Maldor from damnation.  Roderigo's court is filled with . . . well, with courtiers, who are no better than they should be, but jealously guard their privelges.<br/>
<br/>
Yet days ago, a change came over Roderigo.  The Count now denies that he is the messiah.  The news has dismayed his wife, his priest, and his courtiers.  It has demoralized his soldiers, and outraged the long-mistreated peasants who had sacrificed so much to man they had mistaken for the Chosen One.  The exact cause of Roderigo's crisis of self-belief is unknown; some say the Count is experiencing romantic complications with a courtesan; others believe he has been cursed by the Shadow Cult; others whisper that a wandering philosopher opened the Count's eyes (or demoralized him so that the county would be lost).<br/>
<br/>
In battle against the ambitious Baron Karza, Roderigo's soldiers were worsted.  Karza's troops now march on Roderigo's lands, burning and pillaging all who defy them.  From royalists to rebels, powerful and peasants, there is little time left to secure one's own agenda before the county goes up in flames.                </div>
