How do you know what people will like about it?</blockquote>\nSeems like a good topic for discussion, though I think we should start from the assumption that you've designed a game (at least the initial draft) that you, the designer, like very much.  Trying to design a game based on other people's supposed preferences is the road to disaster. BUT! Now that you have a game, you're going into the revision, publication, and marketing process trying to figure out how to present your game so that it really finds its audience.<br/><br/>So, that said, how should we approach answering Simon's questions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306921/#Comment_306921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T10:03:21+00:00" title="January  5, 2011 10:03AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Experts like Paul Beakley haunt the moors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306925/#Comment_306925" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T10:12:58+00:00" title="January  5, 2011 10:12AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, I'm surprised, and indeed, dismayed, that you identify this topic as primarily being one of designers trying to sell/edit what they've designed instead of players trying to play well and enjoyably.  "What do people want?" and "How do they know what they want?" and "How do they tell when they're getting what they want?" are crucial questions for all players at all tables in all games, no matter who designed the game or by what soul-chilling marketing they were sold. So I will address those questions first.<br/><br/>I think one thing that's definitely of importance is that many preferences are <i>decided on</i> rather than <i>discovered.</i>  I can be convinced to want new things, things I didn't previously want, or might not want in another context.  This is something that marketing does, but not exclusively. Art itself can do this. When I listen to a new band, I might say, "wow, these people are fucking great, I must buy their back catalog down to the last crappy movie soundtrack single", without reference to what was put on an album cover or how many radio stations were bribed to play their song.<br/><br/>But other preferences are not decided upon, they aren't chosen in any particular way. Some of these are best considered in terms of prejudices, since they are formed in the same way as prejudices.<br/><br/>I think even beyond those questions is another question that is more germane to the play experience:<br/><br/>What are the best practices for players regarding their preferences?<br/><br/>The goal obviously should be openness and toleration to the extent they can be practiced, but recognition of the limits beyond which they should not go.  How do we do this?  Here are some tips:<br/><br/>* Conscious selection of a new approach. Have you ever played hack-and-slash D&amp;D? Try it. No, go find a game and try it, for reals, see how far you can get into it, what is good about it? (Shopping lists.) What is bad about it? (Arithmetic that accomplishes nothing.)  When you get done you can go back to doing what you did before, write down your thoughts and experiences.<br/><br/>* Try to express as specific a preference as possible for something extremely super-narrow, and why you have the preference.  "I like red-headed female NPCs in my pulp adventure stories because I can vividly imagine them on a fictional pulp magazine cover, even if we're deconstructing a bit and they don't fit directly into a pulp stereotype."<br/><br/>More to come?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306927/#Comment_306927" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T10:14:35+00:00" title="January  5, 2011 10:14AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Experts like Paul Beakley haunt the moors.</blockquote>\nBut I'm mean.

It's really fucking hard, and even "those games get in the hands of people who want what they offer and deliver on what they promise" isn't that simple, because both, say, Medal of Honor and Call of Duty deliver what they promise, but CoD delivers more and/or better.  And then there's the brand lock-in you see with D&amp;D - which is still the most succesful ttrpg, right?  Are people playing it because they're promised something and getting it?  Or are they playing it because everyone else is, because of social proof?<br/><br/>But just on the "What do people want? Do people know what they want?" front:<br/><br/>1) You can approach this by looking at successful titles and making them "like that, but better" - this is how Blizzard made Warcraft and World of Warcraft.  They looked at the successful Dune 2 and the successful Everquest and one-upped.  Usually you're going to fail with this approach, though:  the title you're imitating is going to come out with a sequel about the same time as your title, and you aren't going to have the resources to compete, plus they've got brand lock-in.<br/><br/>2) You can approach this with polls, surveys, focus groups.  Another troubled path.  People don't know what they want.  They will tell you they want whatever their latest, favorite game has....and see <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  <br/><br/>3) You can introspect.  "I love this kind of thing, so I bet other people would love this kind of thing."  That's how I came up with the swinging game mechanic in Spider-Man 2.  It's problematic because you might be weird - what you like might not be what the masses like.  In fact, because you are so deeply into games, you may find the trite surface amusements the masses enjoy unpalatable, and your deeper pleasures may be inaccessible to them!  (For me, Spider-Man 2 was successful beyond expectations, but I don't know how much of that came from the game mechanics and how much came from a powerful brand.  Otoh, Schizoid, another introspective title, did not sell as well as we expected.)<br/><br/>4) You can try a "funnel" approach - this is what TV does.  They film a crapload of pilots, and test them, and keep the one(s) that people like the best.  To extend to games, make a crapload of prototypes.  Follow up on, refine, and sell the one(s) that get traction.  This is probably the most effective method, but it can have problems too.  Some of your unfinished games may not be ready when you test them, and you might kill something that could have been really good because people don't like it - yet.  <br/><br/>So a mixture of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> &amp; <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is probably your best bet.  Make a bunch of games you love.  Keep working on the ones that other people love, too.  <br/><br/>Of course, that's probably what you were doing anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306939/#Comment_306939" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T11:09:03+00:00" title="January  5, 2011 11:09AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>JD#1:</b> Approaching it from the players' perspective is also awesome.

Most people don't like to be caught liking something that is agreed by everyone else to be crap. When a well-known designer makes a game, people have permission to like it. When a less well known designer makes a game, they don't, so they're more cautious about it.<br/><br/>People choose their preferences based on what those things say about them. This is more true of music and other things with strong cultural markers, but there's still meaning in being a D&amp;D kind of a person over a Polaris kind of a person.<br/><br/>Possibly people don't know what they want. They say they want a game with lots of violence, simple rules, and a strong GM. Then they sit down to an introspective and complex GMless game, and have a blast.<br/><br/>Context is probably important. If your friend tells you a game is great, you look at it charitably, and decide you like it. You see some asshole playing it, you decide it's a game for assholes, so you hate it.<br/><br/>Sometimes you sit down to eat your soup, and they've changed the recipe. Any you're like "Shit!" and "I liked the old soup!". But if you trust your soup merchant, maybe you keep eating anyway, and maybe you find out that you like the new soup just as much. Maybe better!<br/><br/>What if the people who need your game are not the people who want your game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306991/#Comment_306991" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T14:33:35+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  2:33PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Simon:</b> Those are some super-interesting thoughts.

I think that if you don't buy into the characters as macho warriors, if that's not something that holds any appeal to you, then there's really not much drama in that being subverted by them sprouting suppurating pussies or birthing cockeels. But how many people who are into games about macho fighting dudes are also into gonzo body-horror? I hope a few of them at least.<br/><br/>Dungeonfuckers is what I've got to say about macho fighting games, but who wants to hear that? Not many of the people who love those games, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

There's also an argument that much of marketing is convincing people they have problems that need solving. I'm not a huge proponent of the latter but the former has some merit, at least when it comes to marketing games. I think it's easy/lazy to couch RPGs in aesthetic/artistic terms, but it's kind of a marketing rabbit hole to try and chase taste that way. If you've got crazy money and a distribution foothold, you can go the Fantasy Flight route and market the shit out of visual aesthetics. I don't think anyone in this little pocket universe is playing at that scale, so that leaves us with gameplay aesthetics -- good luck trying to describe that!<br/><br/>I think a really good place for many/most game designer-slash-publishers to start is to really think about what gaming problems their designs solve. I think at some level, the indie gaming community has already done the work of convincing people they have gaming problems that need solving, or that there are (passive voice here) <i>problems that needed to be solved.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_307062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307062/#Comment_307062" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T04:27:54+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  4:27AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2011 4:30AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Sometimes people need permission to like a thing.</blockquote>Yes, and a lot of people are not permitted to like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">games</span>.
