We ended up getting so carried away that we played for three hours. There were a few issues with the design, but overall it was tremendously easy and effective.<br/><br/>We were driving late at night, so the game had to work in the dark - nothing written down, no dice, etc.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Rules<br/>--------<br/></b><br/>1. As a group, decide on a general genre for your story. <br/><br/>We chose "something like Harry Potter, but creepy, and without using any actual Harry Potter characters or things". <br/><br/>(Choosing a movie or book everyone is familiar with is a great shortcut for this kind of thing.)<br/><br/>2. Start playing! Each player takes a turn in order, as described below. <br/><br/>3. You can keep playing as long as you like. When you all agree that a good ending is reached, the game ends.<br/><br/><br/><b>Taking Your Turn<br/>---------------<br/></b><br/>On the very first turn, give us the opening line of the story, and then turn to the person next to you and ask them a question.<br/><br/>We played two games, and I started each one with something I hoped would spark some interesting material. This worked very well.<br/><br/>For the Harry Potter-esque game, I said something like:<br/><br/>"When Officer Little of the London Police Force returned to his home and opened the door, he was surprised to see someone he knew very well engaged in a <i>most</i> unusual activity."<br/><br/>Then I asked:<br/><br/>"What was this person wearing?"<br/><br/>For the second and subsequent turns, your narration must answer the question asked of you, and then you ask the person next to you another question.<br/><br/>The game continues quite naturally at this point.<br/><br/>"She was wearing bright purple robes and streaking around the room on a broomstick! [to the next player] How did the little girl react when saw her dad open the door, catching her red-handed?"<br/><br/>(You can add information and imply things in your narration, like my sister did in this example, or you can just simply answer the question.)<br/><br/><br/><b>Advanced Rules: The Oracle<br/>-----------------------<br/></b><br/>The basic rules, above, worked quite well, but I decided to try adding another little tool to the game. I called it the Oracle, and it worked quite well. <br/><br/>It's designed for three people, since there were three of us. <br/><br/>If you have more than three people, I'd say that the current player and the two players beside them should participate.<br/><br/><br/><b> Using the Oracle</b><br/><br/>Any player make call on the Oracle at any time, either simply to give the current narrator a little creative constraint, or because a character in the story is in a difficult situation and we want to see how it turns out.<br/><br/>- "She runs down the stairs to the treasure chest, and, with a single magic word, its lid flies off! What does she find inside?"<br/><br/>- "Um, she..." [player hesitates]<br/><br/>- "Let's consult the Oracle!" <br/><br/>- "Sure!"<br/><br/>When the Oracle is called for, narration stops.<br/><br/>We count to three and then each player holds up one hand. You may display any number of fingers, from none (a closed fist) to five (an open hand).<br/><br/>If you want things to go well, choose a larger number of fingers (3, 4, or 5). If you want things to turn for the worse, stick up a smaller number (none, 1, or 2).<br/><br/>Add together all the fingers showing for a number from 0 to 15.<br/><br/><b>Oracle Outcomes</b><br/><br/>0-1: A miracle! The very best of all possible things.<br/>2-5: Things are bad, very bad indeed.<br/>6-9: Looks good! However, in reality, this is bad news indeed...<br/>10-13: An excellent turn; a pleasant surprise.<br/>14-15: Utter catastrophe! Your darkest fear come to life.<br/><br/>To be memorized, or saved on someone's phone screen for reference if memorizing is difficult.<br/><br/>The feel in play is very "Apocalypse World"-like, with the 6-9 outcome being most common, <br/>occasional 2-5 or 10-13 outcomes, and a rare surprise of 0-1 or 14-15 (which occur when you least expect them, as you can probably see from the chart). <br/><br/><br/><b>What Should You Do When You Don't Have a Good Idea Immediately?</b><br/><br/>* Add a little Colour, a little detail, and ask a question about whatever has you stumped.<br/><br/>It's totally acceptable not to answer the question you've been asked fully.<br/><br/>Remember, our last example was: <br/><br/>- "She runs down the stairs to the treasure chest, and, with a single magic word, its lid flies off! What does she find inside?"<br/><br/>You could answer:<br/><br/>- "The chest flies open and a stream of bright light radiates into the room! Does she look directly into the light or does she cover her eyes?"<br/><br/>* Ask for an outcome from the Oracle<br/><br/>This is usually sufficient to give you an idea.<br/><br/>* Keep your answer as short as possible, and ask another question.<br/><br/><br/><b>Helping the Story Wrap Up</b><br/><br/>This is the most difficult part, since the game doesn't help you tie up plot lines or anything like that. (If you would like to comment on improving this part of the design, I would love to hear your thoughts.)<br/><br/>We came up with two basic principles, and then added a slightly more involved technique.<br/><br/>1. Be Obvious. <br/><br/>As per the improv rule: don't try to be complex and clever; say what comes to mind immediately, and let the other players build on that.<br/><br/>2. Reincorporate, reincorporate, reincorporate.<br/><br/>Keep track of things left behind and keep bringing them back into the story!<br/><br/>Bringing back something which happened near the very beginning helps create a good ending.<br/><br/>3. As the story unfolds, anyone may suggest that a Character is sufficiently Important to have a Goal. In our story, the young girl wanted to enter the magical world, while a frightening creature called Legion wanted someone of her bloodline to fulfill her mother's curse.<br/><br/>The story ends when each Important Character achieves or fails at their Goal.<br/><br/>It's good practice to use the Oracle when such an opportunity exists for a Character, although it is not strictly necessary.<br/><br/>We had three main characters, and I wouldn't go too far beyond that. One would be sufficient; two is nice; three is a party.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Feedback welcome!

A sort of "critical hit" effect.<br/><br/>Once we had a really dramatic situation where the young girl was trying to escape from the monster. We were all rooting for her, and we all hoped she would escape. When we all revealed our Oracle choices, we all had five fingers showing. Oh no! Disaster strikes!<br/><br/>I found this effect very exciting and dramatic.<br/><br/>It also makes the choice of lots-of-fingers vs. few-fingers less obvious. If I want a good outcome for a certain situation, I need to choose a higher number of fingers. Without the funky reverse-result, I might as well just choose 5 all the time.<br/><br/>This way, however, I have an interesting choice: do I want to maximize my chances of a good outcome, and stick up 5 fingers, or do I want to minimize the odds of a disaster, and hold up only 3 or 4? 5 fingers gives better odds of a good outcome overall, but also higher chances of disaster.<br/><br/>That makes the whole Oracle thing work, and a little tense at times.<br/><br/>It also means more 6-9 results, which are the most interesting ones... (very much like the 7-9 "yes, but" result in Apocalypse World).<br/><br/>(I entirely agree with your suggestion of a buzzword. I've seen this a lot in all kinds of game designs as well.

Sometimes it's sheer plot control issues - this might be called GMless railroading.  Sometimes people just aren't clear on how big a "chunk" should be, and/or the mechanics don't limit the size of a chunk clearly.  There's also something to it that smacks of the tension between "author stance" (prescient) and "audience stance" (reactive).  Some players seem to feel that being in "author stance" means you have to know the outcome or underlying connection *now*, so you can write the scene that's going to <i>lead</i> there (as opposed to letting the group handle it and being surprised later), so they tie up all the loose ends *now* but that means everyone else is forced to simply re-enact the story that person plotted.  Sometimes it's an urge that <i>feels</i> like a stroke of genius, sprung from the natural desire to de-complicate things, but on the meta-level it ends up creating more complication for everyone else because now they have to continue on with fewer loose ends available, and with the only pieces you've left them.  <br/><br/>That's what led to my first tongue-in-cheek buzzword suggestion, because taken to its extreme, over-explaining or over-narrating is like "ending now".  It's especially problematic when it happens in the first half (rising action) of the story.  It can be a good thing as you get to the end.  For a "final explanation" type of scene near the end of Act 3, this can be an invaluable instinct.  But not before.<br/><br/>[If you feel this is off topic, Paul, we can start another thread.]<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441177/#Comment_441177" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-05T04:54:21+00:00" title="January  5, 2015  4:54AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2015 4:54AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tod,<br/><br/>An excellent point, and I agree in full.

I wouldn't be surprised if something like this has been used in a board game, but I've never seen it in an RPG.</blockquote>\nYeah, I must confess I haven't come across an Oracle Table before. It's a damn good idea, which I will now steal for my next <del>tric</del> game.<br/><br/>As to buzzwords, yep, buzzwords are always good. I like <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf%27s">@AsIf's</a> <i>Authoritis</i>, but that sounds a bit too Forgeite for my taste. <i>Railroading</i> is good too, but is reminiscent of trad games. How about <i>Roadhogging</i>, which IMO accurately reflects what's going on, i.e. one player dominating the content. In the book you could perhaps have an amusingly-drawn 'hog' talking and gesticulating, with the other players shrinking away from it. And I know whereof I speak here, because content-hogging is my biggest failing as a roleplayer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441186/#Comment_441186" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-05T19:07:08+00:00" title="January  5, 2015  7:07PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cat-Hogging!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441187/#Comment_441187" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-05T19:10:25+00:00" title="January  5, 2015  7:10PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Cat-Hogging!</blockquote>\nHehe yes.

For instance, "What happens next?"<br/><br/>That's quite possibly the worst possible question: it doesn't give the next player anything to go on.<br/><br/>My favourite questions are indirect and concern seemingly unimportant details.<br/><br/>Let's say the last sentence was:<br/><br/>"He jumps forward and pulls the trigger!"<br/><br/>I like questions like:<br/><br/>"What does the gun feel like in his hand?"<br/><br/>"What is Fang's last thought before he snuffs it?"<br/><br/>"How do the spectators react to this?"<br/><br/>"When was the last time Fang has ever been in a situation like this?"<br/><br/><br/><b>Breaking Up the Action</b><br/><br/>If there is action happening in the story, use questions to break it up. The game is not very exciting if your narration looks like this:<br/><br/>"Officer Little jumps forward, pulls out his gun, and fires it into the mob boss's face, who falls backwards, dead, into the hands of his bodyguards. Then Officer Little does a somersault over the remaining bodyguards, runs out the door, and drives back home."<br/><br/>Instead, give us a touch, and then let the next player determine how it turns out:<br/><br/>""Officer Little jumps forward, pulls out his gun, and levels it at the boss. The gun bucks in his hand! What does his adversary's face look like as he stares down the barrel of the gun?"<br/><br/>It is best (and most fun/interesting) if your narration doesn't ever complete an entire scene or bit of the story; instead, start the action rolling, and then prompt another player with a question to complete your idea. This keeps everyone in suspense and the story exciting - maybe your friend will decide that the mob boss survives this scene after all, and the story heads in a direction you didn't anticipate.

I think you need to firm up the rules regarding when the oracle is required. More on this in a moment.<br/><br/>2. The issue with "runaway narration" is more complex IMO than just the number of sentences.<br/><br/>There's a difference between narration that causes actions to happen and the state of the world to change (transformative narration), and narration that describes the current state of the world (descriptive narration). Descriptive narration is (almost) always helpful and interesting if it doesn't go on for too long. Transformative narration is dangerous if over-used, leading to "hogging" (wrapping up too many plot threads) or "demiurging" (creating too many plot threads).<br/><br/>Hogging: Every time a narrator wraps up a loose end, it leaves something less for the next narrator to work with. If one person does it too much, then they are exercising an unfair level of control over the story and also making it go by too fast<br/><br/>Demiurging: the flip side of the coin is a runaway narration where too many loose ends (or plot threads) are created at once, and everyone loses track of the story. I've seen this happen too!<br/><br/>3. Back to the oracle, probably the players MUST consult the oracle whenever a plot thread is being tied up. This is good for suspense, diffuses story responsibility across the players, and also stops the narration and prevents a player from tying up more than one thread at a time (i.e. prevents hogging).<br/><br/>4. You need a simple mechanism for stopping demiurging. I think you already recognize this, and your one sentence rule is an attempt at this. More on this in a bit.<br/><br/>5. You need a mechanism for closing up the game. Since you're in a car, and all cars have clocks, I'd suggest that at a pre-agreed set point, or when everyone agrees, you call the End Game. At this point, plot threads can only be tied up until there are none left, then it's the end.<br/><br/>6. From what you're saying, it sounds to me like each narration has 3 parts:<br/><br/>   A. Descriptive narration<br/>   B. Transformative narration (ONE action only, preferably in one sentence)<br/>   C. Ask a question that leads to descriptive narration<br/><br/>This creates a natural progression from one player to the next, as the question naturally leads to the next player describing the new state of the world in response to the previous player's change.<br/><br/>e.g.<br/><br/>Me: "The gunman's face is pale in the glare of the naked light bulb. He lifts the gun toward Max, and fires a shot. What is Max thinking?"<br/><br/>You: "Max has an image of his lost daughter fixed firmly in his mind. She's all he can think about. The world around him becomes dreamy, unfixed, unfocused. He doesn't even hear the shot fire--because he's not there anymore.

That's a very interesting way to look at it! ("Demiurge" is a good friend and fellow storytelling game designer - we used to work on this kind of thing together a lot.)<br/><br/>However, I'll add that the way you're describing the turns (as a three-part process) is not the only or best way. Sometimes I think that simply answering the question and asking a new one is better. (i.e. Leaving out the second step in your breakdown - for an example, see the answer from my sister in the first example given under "Taking Your Turn" in my original post: this sort of thing worked great.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure that one is better than the other, and for now I'm leaving the rules open for either possibility. If you get a chance to play (it's easy enough to play by forum - we could easily start a thread where we play the game - who's in?), we can try it both ways and see if one has a strong advantage over the other or not.<br/><br/>I like the idea of leaving description wide-open, however.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of enforcing Oracle use, although I'm not sure how easy it is to codify it for "a plot thread gets tied up". It might be easier simply to include that as advice: "When it seems like an important plot thread is wrapping up, call for the Oracle."<br/><br/>To me, the main issue with this game is getting stories to wrap up and end. I am still looking for a clean and effective tool for doing this, in line with the brief elegance of the other rules so far.<br/><br/>A time limit doesn't strike me as elegant or helpful (what if we hit the time limit at the most interesting part of the story? what if we hit the time limit precisely after we demiurged so many plot threads that we don't know where to go next?).<br/><br/>I like "Quick Turn", it strikes me as a pretty good title for this.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" title="Demiurge"><img alt="Demiurge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/684/n5EMN506IRUMS.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">Demiurge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441266/#Comment_441266" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-08T22:00:18+00:00" title="January  8, 2015 10:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, let's give it a playtest <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>   Seems easy enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441269/#Comment_441269" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-08T22:52:20+00:00" title="January  8, 2015 10:52PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2015 10:57PM by AsIf.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To me, the main issue with this game is getting stories to wrap up and end.

But doing it simpler, more streamlined, for a purpose such as "Quick Turn" (are we decided, that's the title?) - that's a trickier task.<br/><br/>Submitted from my doodlings on the subject...<br/><br/>There's a hidden dynamic regarding "N" (the introduction of new elements) versus "R" (the reuse of existing elements) going on in ScenePlay, and this is because I noticed the same dynamic in fiction in general.  Here is a chart to explain it:\n<pre>ACTION                      ACT1  ACT2  ACT3<br/>---------------------       ----  ----  ----<br/>N = introduce new element   lots  less  none  <br/>R = reuse existing element  none  more  lots<br/></pre>\nThere's a sliding ratio in which N starts high and ends low, while R starts low and ends high.  It makes an "X" if you draw it on a graph.  What might be required is a mechanic that forces or rewards moves/scenes that follow (or manifest) this sliding ratio as play proceeds.<br/><br/>This doesn't guarantee that your story will wrap up neatly, but it would ensure that there's an "economy" in play which guides players to build in a fruitful direction for such closure to occur.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441274/#Comment_441274" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-08T23:22:07+00:00" title="January  8, 2015 11:22PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I realise I haven't quite answered the OP in the way you were expecting, but what do think of my idea of having vignettes?

Six-sided dice work with the rules as written (just increase the values in the Oracle table by 3).<br/><br/>Using playing cards (e.g. Ace through Six) would probably work even better.<br/><br/>I don't think the threat of "all players showing 0" is really something to worry about. It's pretty unlikely, and all it takes is one sadistic player to spoil the process... we never saw a single "miracle" result in our whole game.<br/><br/>As for tuning the Chart for the number of players, I'm torn between making a bunch of charts for every possible number of players, or simply saying something like "the current player and the last two players in order hold up one hand". Both solutions are simple enough, anyway, so it doesn't matter too much.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">@Demiurge</a>:<br/><br/>I understand what you're saying. I'm just thinking that perhaps leaving Step B out altogether works just as well or better. (Playtesting will tell! But when we tried it briefly, it felt really good to just do "answer question in one sentence", "ask new question".)<br/><br/>A two-step process is simpler than a three-step one, after all...<br/><br/>In either case, I'm not certain - it's something that deserves playtesting, in any case.<br/><br/>However, I like the quick and easy nature of the current version of the rule/guideline. Easier to explain and understand than the 3-step version you're proposing (although yours may work better with experienced story gamers, perhaps).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">@Steve_Hickey</a>:<br/><br/>That's an excellent idea, and precisely the kind of thing I'm looking for! <br/><br/>Something that's simple and uncontroversial but still flexible, as the Motifs you suggested, is perfect for this game.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's exactly right, but it may very well be. I have one of the players from the car ride here with me, and had her read your comment. She said, "That sounds like what we did with character Goals. Pretty much the same, right?"<br/><br/>Well, yes and no. Very similar, true.<br/><br/>I guess that's another thing to try!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine">@Abstract_Machine</a>:<br/><br/>The idea of the epiphany is exactly right for this game, as well. Great post! <br/><br/>I'm not entirely certain how to implement it, but I'll think on it (and welcome any suggestions).<br/><br/>The Motifs are one idea; identifying character Goals and having a little epilogue for each character is also possible.<br/><br/>I like how Fiasco forces an ending to the story by leading us to the Aftermath, no matter where we ended the story.<br/><br/>Using the Oracle for each character's ending could work, perhaps. We've reached the end, so we consult it for each character's Fate, and then ask questions as usual to flesh it out. That forms the epilogue of the story.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>:<br/><br/>Yes! The rate of reincorporation is obviously key (and something Demiurge and I have discussed a lot, more-or-less along the same lines you're describing here), and actually was what we used to signal the end of the story. In both games, a player came up with a clever way to bring back an element from the beginning, and when they did so, we all felt that a natural ending had taken place.<br/><br/>I don't know if I agree with there being no new ideas at the end of the story, however. Sometimes it can be fun to have a twist or revelation which suggests a whole other plotline (as in a film which ends in such a way as to suggest a sequel is on the way, for example) at the end of the story. I wouldn't want to rule that out.<br/><br/>Generally, however, that is certainly how stories go. How do you accomplish this in your game design?<br/><br/>I've always found it interesting to consider which parts need to be enforced/mechanized, and which can be simply guided and left up to players' natural story-telling instincts.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/catty_big">@catty_big</a>:<br/><br/>I did see your post, but forgot to reply, sorry.

So as you approach the end and your budget begins dwindling, there is increasing motivation (eventually downright necessity) to reuse elements that were already on the table.<br/><br/>Sparing the use of tokens you could do scoring like "GHOST" (remember that word game from childhood, in which every time you fail you "get a letter" - first you have "G", then you have "GH", then you have "GHO" then "GHOS" and when you do it the fifth time you are a "GHOST" and lose the game?)  Except instead of measuring "failure" our letters might represent "new elements added".

The very best of all possible things.<br/><b>3 to 6</b>: Things are bad, very bad indeed.<br/><b>7 to 9</b>: The Worm Turns: An apparently good outcome which, in reality, presents a dark twist.<br/><b>10 to 12</b>: An excellent turn; a very pleasant surprise.<br/><b>13 to 15</b>: Utter catastrophe! Your darkest fear come to life.<br/></blockquote>\nAny comments and thoughts welcome.<br/><br/>Working the game's title into the chart seems like it might help memorization.<br/><br/>I like the more common extreme results (which otherwise are incredibly rare). It still requires all three players to be on the same page (i.e. ALL THREE must submit a choice on the same end of the scale in order for this outcome to occur - for instance, even a 3, 4, and 5 is still not sufficient for a catastrophe - we need two players to choose 5, or two 4s and a 5, in order for that to happen; if even one player picks a number below the middle of the scale, a catastrophe is not possible).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it makes it impossible to divide the scale evenly unless I make the Worm Turns a 6 to 9 result. However, I worry that at this point it would make it far TOO common - it's the most common result as it is.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this being a diceless game, the players can theoretically adjust their votes to get whatever distribution they want regardless of how the scale is broken, so in theory any distribution at all is functional.<br/><br/>As a fun side-effect (and totally unintentional), this matches the Apocalypse World scale of outcomes, which is fun (and could maybe even be used in a diceless AW game, so long as only *natural* 13 or higher results are considered catastrophes). It's a total coincidence, but it might also help people memorize the scale (granted, that only works for AW fans).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441524/#Comment_441524" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-15T03:24:05+00:00" title="January 15, 2015  3:24AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true, Tod!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442310/#Comment_442310" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T19:04:34+00:00" title="January 30, 2015  7:04PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those playing (or even those reading/watching), now that the game's been going on for a while, how do you feel about the length-of-narration rules?<br/><br/>The rule we're using:<br/><br/>* Answer with a single sentence.<br/>* If your answer includes dialogue, you may break this rule, so long as your actual prose - the narration part of your answer - is no longer than a single line/sentence.<br/><br/>For instance, it's totally acceptable to say something like this:<br/><br/>"Noooo!"

Maybe it\u2019s best to be patient &amp; let the Themes take care of themselves.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine" title="Abstract_Machine"><img alt="Abstract_Machine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/129/nO5PORA7XV4QA.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine">Abstract_Machine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442615/#Comment_442615" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-07T07:30:52+00:00" title="February  7, 2015  7:30AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Paul_T</b> <i>I'm a little confused by this turn of events, but let's go with it.
