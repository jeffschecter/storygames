What have you learned to say that draws customers in? What have you learned does not work?<br/><br/>For example. At the Pelgrane booth, we stand behind trestle tables, on which our gamebooks are displayed. When a customer starts looking through a book, I give them about 15 seconds, then say:<br/><br/><i>Can I show you the best thing in that book?</i><br/>or <i>Can I tell you a bit about that?</i><br/><br/>It varies, depending on the book. For the Book of Unremitting Horror, I'll say: "Can I show you my favourite monster in that book?". For Mutant City Blues, I'll say "Can I show you the best thing...?", then show them the Quade Diagram.<br/><br/>After explaining a bit, I'll back off for a while and let them look through the book on their own.<br/><br/>Vincent, from a brief conversation, has a different strategy. He'll start with "Hi, I'm Vincent" (I wonder whether "Hi, I'm Graham" would work for me).<br/><br/>He'll then say "Come inside", while beckoning. That's because his booth is much more open: people hang about on the periphery, wondering whether to come closer. (We don't get that so much. People don't mind approaching a trestle table.)<br/><br/>Conversely, I've learned never to say "That's my book" when people look at Play Unsafe. I used to say that, but it killed conversations dead.<br/><br/>What do you say? I'm looking for specific phrases and gestures. Tell me, also, whether it works and what your booth is like (because that makes a difference).<br/><br/>(It would be quite nice to get through this thread without a big essay on Someone's Theory Of Sales At Conventions appearing. I'm really interested in those specific, small interactions and how you phrase things.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287218/#Comment_287218" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T10:30:14+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Oh man, I played that last month and we had this craaazy giant hawk-man come down and kick everyone's ass.

Don't try this unless you can be absolutely sincere, because people are not stupid. Also don't try this if your one-sentence stories are weird or boring. But in general - and I think this is contrary to conventional wisdom - people like to hear about your play.<br/><br/>I've found that establishing yourself as a player who genuinely likes games causes people to open up a bit and start asking questions. You become human instead of a booth monster trying to harass them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287221/#Comment_287221" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T10:37:49+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At Design Matters, generally the only thing I have to say is, "Here's your change."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287222/#Comment_287222" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T10:38:17+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have found that the hard-sell doesn't work for me- perhaps I don't have the right demeanor, but saying "can I help you find something?" or "what kinds of games do you like?" tends to put people on the defensive and chase them away.  <br/><br/>What did work for me was a more gentle approach, saying something like "if I can answer any questions for you, just let me know" and then leaving them alone but staying nearby.  If they were just idly looking at the booth, that was often enough to draw them in, even if just to ask where another booth was located.  If they were already in the booth, most of the time it seemed to make them comfortable and give them an opening to ask for more information.<br/><br/>I also found myself affirming their choices when they came to the register.  "Oh, that's my favorite game! Good choice!" I didn't always do that (it was a genuine response) but it felt right to reinforce their decision as they hand over their precious dollars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287228/#Comment_287228" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T10:49:45+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2010 10:51AM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Have you ever read or seen X, Y, or Z?"<br/><br/>X, Y, or Z being books or movies similar to your game. <br/><br/>If the answer is no, it's still a conversation and you can pull back or engage more based on the person's interest.<br/><br/>If the answer is yes but they don't like X, Y, or Z, then you can ask why and see if the game addresses that. Sometimes liking a certain movie except for the crappy ending is a great thing because now you have more control over how it ends when you play.<br/><br/>I like using questions (especially yes or no questions to start) because my main goal is to get a game into someone's hands who will really like it. I'd rather sell 1 game to a person I think will play than 10 who won't. <br/><br/>If it doesn't look like the game is a good match for the person, I will kindly point them to someone else if I think they have something they would be more interested in. I try to imagine I'm the person I'm speaking to and do what I can to give them what they want while keeping it as brief as possible so I don't waste anyone's time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287234/#Comment_287234" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T10:56:24+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:56AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never tell people it's my game. What worked well at Design Matters would be if someone came up and started looking at my game, someone <i>else</i> would go chat with them about it, and if the person asked a specific question or something, then my boothmate would say, "Well, why don't you ask the designer? She's right over there!" and I'd wave and start talking to the person. I think people feel uncomfortable when they're picking up a book casually, without any real thought whether it's for them, and then all of a sudden the author is RIGHT THERE. I went to this Mexican restaurant once where our server talked us into way more food and drink than we wanted, because he was the owner. "Limonada? I made it myself this morning." "My wife's flan is fantastic, are you sure you're full?" It's really awkward as a consumer to have to break away from something someone's personally invested in. I remember Daniel and I trading off on approaching people who were looking at Blowback and Happy Birthday Robot!, but it just sort of organically happened\u2014 it wasn't a big plan at the time.<br/><br/>I never really did the hard sell, either. I'm bad at talking to people about games right-off, without them leading the conversation. I would, however, usher people into the booth if they spent more than a few long moments staring outside, and urge them to sit down and flip through the binder. I remember telling one guy "Look, seriously, if you're going to stare at our books you might as well take a load off while you do it. Come on, sit down, I'll show you a menu and you can stop squinting."  He ended up buying a couple different things.<br/><br/>So I guess I'm comfortable with the hard sell when it comes to getting people to sit down. But, I mean, chairs! Especially in cosplay footwear, people need to take a break and relax.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287236/#Comment_287236" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T10:57:41+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:57AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2010 11:02AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Rob's Guide to Boothing</b><br/><br/>I flatter myself that I'm pretty good at this. This is what I do:<br/><br/>* Stand just outside the booth (or at the edge if my feet can't handle the raw floor)<br/>* Try to make eye contact with everyone who passes by.<br/>* If you return it, I smile at you, nod, and see what you do.<br/>* If you have no interest in the booth, you'll usually break eye contact by that point.<br/>* If not, I talk to you.<br/><br/>What I say varies highly depending on a lot of things. Crucially, as I talk to you, I look for what you want, serve your needs, find what you're interested in, make <i>you</i> the most important thing. I don't worry about what I have on sale or a promotion or a game I think you should play. That's bullshit. (I realize I might be in the minority on some of those points, but I believe in customer-focused service.)<br/><br/>Also, be enthusiastic. If you can't, go get some rest off the booth or something.<br/><br/><b>"What can I help you with?"</b><br/><br/>I like this, but my fellow boothmates seemed to be uncomfortable with that, so I didn't use it. Open questions (ones you can't answer yes or no to) are good because they start conversations.<br/><br/><b>"Are you looking for anything in particular?"</b><br/><br/>This was more or less what I wound up with as the default at Gen Con because 50%-80% of the people who came by were interested in <i><a href="http://www.dresdenfilesrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">The Dresden Files RPG</a></i><br/><br/>If I get a "no," I usually say, "Well, let me know if you have any questions. I know a lot about most of these games. I'll be right over here."<br/><br/>If I get a "yes," I lead you to what you want.<br/><br/>If I get a mixed response, I work with it on the fly. These are usually pretty productive. "I'm not sure, I'm just looking for new stuff," or something like that. That's gold. It gives a way to serve your needs, which is 100% of the reason I'm there (or should be).<br/><br/>At this point, I ask what kinds of games you like. <br/><br/>If you tell me, "I don't know, I just want to see something cool," or something like that, I'll show you my game. I'll also cop to the fact that it's my game, and make a joke about transparency or something lightly self-depricating.<br/><br/><b>"What kinds of games do you like?"</b><br/><br/>You'll usually tell me "just about everything," so I have to ask you for a specific game you like. If you don't have one, I skip down to "moments of play."<br/><br/>Then I ask what you like about that game, and if the answer is nonsense or confused, I'll ask for a particular exciting moment in play.<br/><br/>I'll echo back to you what I think I heard, as I'm thinking about games that fit that niche. "My group goes in for the tactical map aspects of D&amp;D, but I want more story-focused mechanics." I'm thinking of indie games with minis, or maps, or physical representations, or where positioning matters (<a href="http://www.faterpg.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>Fate</i></a>, <a href="http://www.burningempires.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>Burning Empires</i></a>, <a href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>Agon</i></a>, <a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/index.html" rel="nofollow"><i>3:16</i></a> etc.).<br/><br/>Then I tell you about the game, and the ways in which I think it fits your needs.<br/><br/><b>"Have you been helped?"</b><br/><br/>If I feel like I've been seeing you at the booth for a few minutes now, and I don't remember talking to you, I'll ask if you've been taken care of. I prefer to make it jokey if I feel, by looking at the person, that they won't take offense to something like: "Have you been mobbed yet?" I do this because this line of questioning is pretty much exactly what you ask if you think someone's stealing something, and I don't want you to think I think you're stealing.<br/><br/><b>If you're browsing</b><br/><br/>I usually go after the people who don't have books in their hands first, but if I've processed all of them, I'll go after people who are looking at books, but who I haven't spoken to yet. (Unless the booth is overfull, then I'll focus on helping people who are in the booth already.)<br/><br/>If I know the book you've got in your hands, I'll start the conversation by talking about something I love about that game. If I don't know the game, I usually at least know a selling point or an elevator pitch, and I'll open with that. But if I'm truly stumped or just don't feel like beginning the conversation that way, I'll walk up, say hi, and introduce myself. I'll make an effort to talk about that book, and then engage you further as above.<br/><br/><b>Post-selection lingering</b><br/><br/>If you've decided to buy something and are not making a bee-line for the register, I'll ask if there's anything else you're looking for, and use the techniques above.<br/><br/><b>Booth too full</b><br/><br/>If I notice that things are really cramped in the booth, I'll ask the person I'm speaking with to move to a better spot, or off the booth floor and into the alleyway. I try to make sure that the path along the books to the register is open without being an asshole about it.<br/><br/><b>My group won't play this</b><br/><br/>There are various objections that you will sometimes give me. "My group won't play this," is the big one but there are others, too. Whenever there are objections to play, I try to find out if it's truly possible for you to get to play the game or not. I try to help with strategies, game choice, and even hooking you up with people I know in the area who might want to play. I also advocate making new gamers over getting your game to play differently.<br/><br/>In terms of selling the game to your group, specifically, I'll again ask what kinds of games you play, and crucially, I'll ask what the most-resisitant members of the group enjoy playing. Then I try to see if there are any games in our stable that can serve that player.<br/><br/><b>Book in hand</b><br/><br/>I try to get a book in your hands as quickly as possible. I'll grab a second copy so I can flip to the pages I need to show you without taking it from your hands.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>That's what I can think of so far. Hope it's helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287239/#Comment_287239" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T11:00:40+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 11:00AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks pretty solid, Rob.

"My group won't play this" touches off what I said above only if it's wistful. "Gee whiz I love these games, but my group would never ever play them."<br/><br/>When I talk about addressing objections, above, I'm only talking about doing so if I get the clear sense that you want to play the game but think it might be hard.<br/><br/>Example, this one guy was ready to buy my book despite not expecting to be able to play it. He seemed super-excited about it, but sure he wouldn't be able to get his group interested. After I spent a few minutes trying to figure out what his group's objections might be, he seemed ready to buy it.<br/><br/>I thought to myself for a moment, then asked him if he thought he'd get a chance to play it.

I'd generally leave them alone until they stopped for more than a few seconds in front of a shelf. If they picked up a specific game, then I would throw out the "Have you ever read/seen [Similar Media Property X, Y, or Z]?" If the answer was yes, awesome. Expound on how the game emulates the [Similar Media Property]. (Or find someone I know who can.)<br/><br/>If the answer is no, then I would ask what they thought about that genre (sci-fi, fantasy, pulp, gritty war movie etc) of media properties. If they respond enthusiastically that they like that genre of media properties, then I give a more generalized pitch about what makes the game they picked up cool. If, however, they don't care for that genre, I'd ask them what is something they do like and try to recommend a game that will better suit them.<br/><br/>At Pirate Jenny, I was able to be a little more specific in tailoring my approach to the game that a potential customer was interested in - since there were only 12 games on our shelf. For instance, people who picked up Thou Art But A Warrior tend to do this waffling thing where they're interested but afraid of being interested. I'd learned from experience that TABAW sells on the strength of the demo or not at all, so I'd skip the pitch and offer to run a demo. I wound up doing something similar for Serial Homicide Unit, since for some reason our attempts to pitch the game weren't successful but the demos almost always were.<br/><br/>One thing I also was able to do at Pirate Jenny that I couldn't do at IPR was give elevator pitches for everything on the shelf and hone in on what they seemed most interested in. I generally did this if someone wandered in and stared at several titles without picking anything up for a minute or so. I'd step in and ask if I could help them by briefly describing the games we offered. The couple of times I tried that trick the customers were really impressed that we could be knowledgeable about the whole catalog, and most of them went on to purchase a specific game that they then expressed interest in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287247/#Comment_287247" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T11:17:11+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 11:17AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never worked in a booth or been a booth babe (and probably for good reason), but one thing I like doing when I have my indie games evangelist hat on is to make sure that the people in the vendor's room know what games I'm running enough ahead of time to get a few in stock, and that at the con they know where and when I'm running them. <br/><br/>I mean, this tends to be win-win -- the vendors drive players to my games, and I drive customers to the vendors.

Each player chooses his character's Beliefs and the whole system centers on challenge them and fighting for them."<br/><br/>And the long pitch: "So you're a young prince and your brother is the duke. And he's a real bastard, you decide to write a Belief, 'I will stop at nothing to topple the duke\u2026'" In the long pitch, I give them the set up and let them ask questions.

In the past I always followed that up by explaining the game in a mini demo but I found that didn't really make sales. Talking too much steps on their energy and kills sales. In the past that didn't bother me because I didn't really think that people would buy and my goal was to explain the system to as many people as possible. Now I'd like to make more money.<br/><br/>This year I let the games do the talking. I have nice cover art and descriptive back blurbs so I waited for people to pick up a game and read it before begining to pitch. Then I'd give them the short line "It's a half hour dungeon game where you beat up the monsters and take their stuff. Then you go home and get to explore your character's life there. Kind of character creation in reverse. The game costs $20 and is modular with the other Dungeon Matrix games."<br/><br/>Now I thought of that as short but in fact it is long which means I probably talked people out of sales. Maybe I should switch it around. "It's a $20 game about beating up monsters and taking their stuff. Plays in a half hour to an hour." Geeze! As I wrote this I could feel the desire to keep on talking! Doing less is more I think.<br/><br/>I went to an Alliance Openhouse in 1994 I think? Frank Chadwick was there so I talked to him (I knew him from going to the Winter Wars convention in Urbana IL). He wasn't pitching at all. Instead he had his wares laid out and was handing out little plastic Traveller Credit slips. The meant nothing to the game or to his sales but offered him a polite inroad to conversation. It seemed to work better than the hard sale. Frank had 17 years of experience then so I think he was on to something. <br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/>Hamster Press                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287453/#Comment_287453" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T05:44:51+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  5:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Chris.
