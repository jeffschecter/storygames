Basically, I've played <i>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i> and read <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Contenders</i>, <i>Drowning &amp; Falling</i>, and <i>Cranium Rats</i>, and I really want to avoid being <i>too</i> derivative of any of those (though a Roach-esque approach to scene framing seems appropriate for my purposes).<br/><br/>I know GM-less games are pretty diverse, but I'd appreciate pretty much any insight into how they're put together, what works and what doesn't. In particular, I'm wondering about games where players each have a primary character versus games that essentially divide up different aspects of GMing/storytelling among the group.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79434/#Comment_79434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T22:09:52+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 10:09PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3359" rel="nofollow">My own thread asking about GM-less games</a>, which, incidentally, contains links to other GM-less game discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

What you often have is a game where all participants are GMs, or at least are expected to perform some or all of the duties and wield some or all of the authority (as Josh was saying) that a GM normally does in a more traditional game. This is kind of the approach I'm taking in The Year We All Died (since we were just talking about that over on the forge). In that game each player has the same authority, powers and responsibility. Although the kind of things you have authority over are a bit different from what a player (GM or otherwise) might in another game, this is still very much a game where everyone is a GM. <br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79452/#Comment_79452" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-04T05:49:06+00:00" title="July  4, 2007  5:49AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you considered playing more of the games that you have available?<br/><br/>I wouldn't worry about being derivative or not, though.
