Unfortunately, the events of this year (both at and away from the con) have soured us on the whole enterprise, such that we are totally done.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it was a very big con, and so naturally we saw many wonderful things, met awesome people, and played a ton of games. This episode is, largely, our highlight reel \u2013 we gush about all the fun we had. With some liberal griping mixed in. Which is pretty much our trademark format.<br/><br/>Also here: a little chat about haunted houses (the kind sponsored by local radio stations), some new TV we\u2019ve been watching, and no small amount of bullshitting.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.selfcriticalhits.com/?p=360" rel="nofollow">Self-Critical Hits Episode 45</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
