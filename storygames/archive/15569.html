You know - "<i>The arch villian has stolen the artefact</i>" initial situation naturally leads to a Long Term Goal of "<i>Catch the villan and retrieve the artefact</i>", which is fine and proper, but one dimensional.  I want the characters to have something else going on in addition to the situation-based goals.  But that was hard for players - how to come up with a long term goal if you dont understand some basics about your character?    During playtest, goals other than situation-based ones slipped through the cracks.<br/><br/>So motivations --&gt;  goals.  This kind of helps - or maybe it just moves the instant inspiration quotient from goal setting to motivation setting...<br/><br/>I will check out mouseguard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352886/#Comment_352886" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-31T21:32:11+00:00" title="December 31, 2011  9:32PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2012 12:20AM by stefoid.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>So what I am trying instead is a shortish list of questions that players must write the answer to for their character.</blockquote>\nI've said it in other threads, but the one question that has made every character I play much, much better is:<br/><br/><b>What do I,<i>the player</i>, want to do in this game?</b><br/><br/>Deciding what kind of play experience I want up front means that I can structure all of my character-creation decisions towards facilitating that play experience.

Some examples:<br/>- With the BIG in Mouseguard, you can use the Instinct to change the facts presented by the GM if the Instinct applies. Ie: "Monty would totally be ready for this, he has xxx as his instinct." So when wrtiing an Instinct the in-game effect drives the choice to interesting places and I never feel it is onerous.<br/>- In Apocalypse World (and some of the hacks, like my own) you develop use a history (Hx) with the other PCs to develop common and conflicting motivations. (This development is two-way, which has additional benefits.) The strength of the history has an in-game effect as to your power to impact on the other character.<br/>- Although I don't own it and haven't played it, the story web think they do at the start of Smallville seems to generate complex motivations pretty easily.<br/><br/>In both MG and AW I've never wondered why I am doing the motivation bit, there is a clear connection to the rules so I can see the benefit. There is nothing wrong with the questions you are asking, but as a player if I have a rules reason, in addition to a story benefit, to do them I will be much more engaged and less questioning.<br/><br/>For AW and Smallville, the key seems to be the collaborative creation of the motivations. You are not staring alone at a question and trying to come at an answer, you are doing it as a group.<br/><br/>I really like your classifications in terms of capturing the types of motivations, but I wonder if it is also worth distinguishing motivations with other players (PVP?) from motivations with the world. One of the things I disliked about how we used to play D&amp;D was that there were only ever positive PVP motivations. Having a broader range of PVP motivations creates a completely different feel like the Hx creates for Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>Anyway, not sure if this is particularly insightful, but hopefully useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352889/#Comment_352889" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-31T23:09:04+00:00" title="December 31, 2011 11:09PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2011 11:11PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Personally I always have an idea of the type of character I want to play, mostly in terms of imagery/style and what the character is capable of.

Maybe you switch systems, maybe you change your goal for this game (again, YOUR goal, this has nothing to do with your character's goals) to something else.<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that I've found that I get much better results from thinking about my goals as a player first.  By focusing in on what kind of fun I want to have, I can keep myself from unintentionally steering myself down a dead end and getting stuck on a character concept that isn't actually any fun for me to play.  Knowing MY goals means that I can make better choices when deciding what my character's personality and goals should be.  Also, just eliminating all of those non-fun options makes the process of creating a complex and interesting character much, much simpler, and faster, too.<br/><br/>For example, if I'm interested in doing a lot of talking in our next game, then I know that any character I create needs to have a personality that encourages him to talk to people.  He should have a goal that can only be achieved by enlisting the aid of other people, to give him reasons to go out and talk to them.  He should have a worldview that either drives him to ask a lot of questions, or to share his opinions freely.  Any decision I make during character creation is going to be explicitly guided by my desire as a player to have lots of fun in-character conversations.  I should be making choices that give us all more hooks to pull my character into the kind of play I want to do.<br/><br/><br/>Regarding long-term in-character goals, I find that I have a lot of difficulty coming up with one unless I am extremely familiar with both the setting for the game and with the specific kind of story/theme we're doing.  If I don't know the setting, I can't figure out what goals are appropriate; if I don't know what kind of story we're telling, I often end up with a goal that doesn't mesh satisfyingly with anything else that's going on and may not even be possible to address before we're done.  I hate when that happens, it really wrecks the flow of a game for me.  When I don't know what our game's going to be about or I don't understand the setting fully, I'll make my character's long-term goal as vague as I can get away with, and tighten it up later on, after we've got a few sessions under our belts and I have a clearer notion of what will work for me.  (Alternately, I'll use one or more other players as a resource, and make my character's long-term goal similar to, part of, or pretty much identical to their characters' goals, and trust that over the course of play we'll diverge enough from that common motivation to make things interesting.  Having two or three characters teamed up like that does a lot to stack the deck towards making their long-term goals really significant and interesting.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352890/#Comment_352890" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-01T00:42:37+00:00" title="January  1, 2012 12:42AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2012 12:56AM by stefoid.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I'm...not sure if you're disagreeing with me?</blockquote>\nNot disagreeing, just chatting.  I think you make a good point.

So when wrtiing an Instinct the in-game effect drives the choice to interesting places and I never feel it is onerous.</blockquote>\nIn my view, good motivations/goals are about driving the character and complicating things for the character.   That what you are calling building the story?  And I agree that mechanical backing should be there to reinforce/encourage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352891/#Comment_352891" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-01T00:53:29+00:00" title="January  1, 2012 12:53AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember Traveller had this 'lifepath' system for character generation where you worked out your skills.

The momentum and interest are killed.<br/></blockquote>\nCan you expand on this?   <br/><br/>I have been basing a lot of my ideas on traditional fiction, and in this case, you are introduced to a protagonist, how they currently are and why, and then as the story goes through to completion, the character generally changes in some way in response to the events - they learn, they grow, they change their minds, etc...  The exploration of character is about <i>under what circumstances will the character change</i>?<br/><br/>Your view is that play starts before the character has even solidified to any great degree?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352940/#Comment_352940" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T04:19:22+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  4:19AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I respect where you are coming from, but my experience is completely different.

First you hook the reader with the situation and ease into character development to avoid boring the watcher/listener to death.  So maybe too much character development at the start of a rpg is like too much expostion at the start of a novel.<br/><br/>The flipside of that is, for players in my groups, character development gets forgotten in favour of reacting to the situation.  Like Wightbred says, it needs to be mechancially supported to encourage  players to keep it in mind during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352976/#Comment_352976" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T15:12:49+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  3:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stefoid">@stefoid</a> <br/><br/>do your players really fail addressing character development in actual play or is it more of a theoretical notion? <br/>I am asking because I have always seen character development happening pretty organically during play, after character creation.<br/><br/>I guess the informal procedure goes somewhat like this:<br/>Player: ".. and my father was a general in the duke's army.."

With it's Psyche system. Which once prompted a player to turn the character concept of 'the Hulk but in a Western' (roughly) to an immigrant trying to buy acceptance with his not-that-valuable-in-this-setting virtues of loyalty and strength. While still being the Hulk in a Western. And that's just chargen, before the Dynamics (which he had set himself up for and the GM was ready to spike, because that's how it works) kick in and stuff starts getting interesting.<br/><br/>If BITs and Keys don't do it for you, odds are good that Rustbelt can at least give you some ideas. I wrote the Psyche system because BITs, Keys, Spiritual Attribes, etc. didn't do what I was looking for. Search the Forge for the Rustbelt and you can read all about it.<br/><br/>Here's something to think about: Psyche traits never give you bonuses or dice or XP, but they're still important to Effectiveness because they provide the motivation necessary to use the Push mechanic. Pushing means overriding a failed roll, but at a Price equivalent to the margin of failure. Psyche traits don't make it any easier, they just allow this in the first place (since they're the whole reason you're Pushing). Nor is the requirement to invoke a trait the balancer; the Price is, so awkward invocation of traits to get bonuses isn't an issue. It's really a great system and more people should be playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353005/#Comment_353005" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T02:28:59+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  2:28AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds interesting, ill check it out.<br/><br/>The main thing Im after is pretty simple.

So not only are the goals a reaction to the on going situation, but the choice of what goals to set are a reflection of where characters personality as well.<br/><br/>Im toying with the idea of a 'motivation fo the week' - like an AW highlighted stat.

I could have a "<i>if you have trouble, follow this procedure...'</i> type of thing where players fill in the blanks, something like Dungeon World.  You could have a bunch of 'fill in the blanks' templates for various types of characters.  That would be super handy for GMs to generate NPCs too!<br/><br/>Like a 'brooding character' template and a 'dashing character' template  and a 'mischievious character' template.<br/><br/>The particular questions you listed for rustbelt, their order and the way they relate to each other above would be great for a brooding character template straight off.<br/><br/>So for a <b>dashing </b>character template, for isntance, you could have:<br/><br/><i>Desire</i>: You are driven to excel and shine in your chosen field.  Your desire is to be the best at what?<br/><i>Issue</i>: Something in your past produced your drive, and it still burns.
