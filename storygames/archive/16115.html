I am not trying to offend anyone, but are writing out of frustration with the use of the terms "mechanics" and "system" on this forum (and others). I would like to present you with a fresh perspective on role-playing games. Please try to read charitably.<br/><br/>From a thread on mechanics I quote:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>-In the games you play, can you trace the fiction back to mechanics ("Jo shooting Jim clearly means that Jo's player used her Condition: armed")?<br/>-If not, does it imply you're creating the fiction without much help from the system, mechanics and fiction each staying in their own realm?<br/>-Do easily reskinnable mechanics mean there was not that much flavor in them in the first place?<br/>-In the games you play, do you ever have things happening in fiction that you absolutely didn't want or couldn't foresee happening, as in, you can't just always interpret the mechanics so that you get something you wanted in the first place?<br/>-If some mechanical element doesn't come up in the game fiction at all, can it still be relevant in some way?</blockquote><b>Mechanics</b><br/><br/>I consider that term to be responsible for the mechanical focus of indie-games in your gaming culture, in lieu with the term "system", which carries much of the same connotations. <br/><br/>The way these questions are phrased is typical of the mechanical focus; a lot of people talk about games as if there was no tools outside the mechanical range. Of course there is, and they know it, but it does not show in their writing! Why? the answer is easy; you lack terms for them, mainly due to the dominance of the terms "system" and "mechanics". The dominant use of these terms indicates that there is nothing but dice/coins out there. As a result you largely ignore the tools that may be had outside the "mechanics".<br/><br/><b>VISION -&gt; INTERACTION -&gt; FICTION</b><br/><i>- a simple model of how to get from A to Z, when thinking of role-playing games</i><br/><br/>The habitual use of misleading terms in rpg-discussions, has enormous impact on your <b>vision</b> when designing a role-playing game. Envisioning game-play is part of the vision every designer has when toying with ideas of a new game. If you are limited to the mechanical range of tools, your vision will be left with little but intuition when it comes to how your game is really played; the real game-play of the game is not in the mechanical range; it takes place in the communication between players; in the verbal, physical and social techniques used by players in a game-session.<br/><br/>The <b>interaction</b> of a role-playing game is a kind of ritual. Everything you do in that ritual counts; talking, touching, grimacing, rolling dice, shuffling coins, consulting rules, doing mathematics, etc. The way you do every single of these things, and the way you bind all of it together, has impact on your game. The interaction of a role-playing game is as diverse as any inter-human interaction, with the added spice that we engage our imagination on a <br/><br/>The goal of the ritual is the creation of an engaging <b>fiction</b>. Every participant in the ritual goes away from it with his/her own fiction. Even though we build our fiction on the same elements, in cooperation, we do not share the fiction. It is internal, and individual. The fiction consist of more than the narrative; it is the thoughts and expectations surrounding the happenings of the game, your subjective point of view, the emotions it stirs in you, what you care about and not, etc.<br/><br/><b>METHOD</b><br/><i>- an old term that can help open your field of thought on what a role-playing game is, and how such games are played</i><br/><br/>When designing for interaction you have to give the players a <b>method</b>. The method is how they are instructed to play the game, in full, the use of mechanics included. Included are also all elements described in the interaction-pharagraph above, especially the use of inherent skills of dialogue. You may group the elements in three main fields; mechanics, techniques and setting. The <i>method</i> is the totality of all you do, and all you make use of, to make the game happen.<br/><br/>There is no need to leave anything out. Everything that has, or may have, an impact on your game, is worth considering as a part of the game-method. If you need to have the game played with hats on; then make hats part of the method. If how players talk is essential; make it part of the method. When you really get this, you may start designing new tools, exploring the possibilities in other parts of the interaction; you may build a method with a new balance in how mechanics and techniques work in your game. <br/><br/><b>SYSTEM AND MECHANICS</b><br/><i>- two terms which are habitually used wrong, to the detriment of clear thinking on role-playing games</i><br/><br/>I have discussed "lumpley system" before, and even though I am in agreement with most of what it stands for, I am not very keen on using it. It is far from intuitive, and too close to the term "system". <br/><br/>I am as opposed to the general use of "system" as I am to the general use of "mechanics". These two terms are habitually used as terms for <i>the totality of play</i>, and therein lies the problem; they do not represent the totality in a good way. They tend to cloud the matter at hand, leading to a lot of unchecked misreadings, when used to discuss the methodology of role-playing games. <br/><br/>The design of a role-playing game is a huge challenge. It is a challenge that is best met with clarity of thought. I suspect that the unfortunate use of "system" and "mechanics" is a problem for budding designers in the English speaking area. The clarity of thought that is so important when designing a new game, is clouded by the use of these terms.<br/><br/><b>THE SIMPLE WAY OF THINGS</b><br/>No role-playing game has ever been played by mechanics alone. To play a role-playing game the players need to make use of <i>techniques</i>, first and foremost. In most games these techniques are supported by mechanics. In most discussions of role-playing games the techniques are forgotten about, and mechanics rule the field alone.

Rather, you provide players with a rules text or teach them to play. The method arises from a momentary agreement, the game rules, between the players of an individual game instance. The <i>mechanics</i> of a game are the operating principles of the structures internal to the game rules. The <i>system</i> (in play) is the totality of the game mechanics. The system (in a wider sense) is the set of all methods under a common heading. Game designers <b>cannot</b> deal directly in method, they can only inspire it. The variety of contexts, players, interpretations and text-modifications is too vast. Mechanics, on the other hand, can be conveyed consistently through rules text.

My peers here in Norway have done likewise. Modern games with fully functional methods consisting of only technique and setting. I find it a challenge to write those modern games, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and to convey how they are played</span>, but no more of a challenge than designing classical role-playing games, with mechanics.<br><br>In my classical design too, when designing with the leader (the "GM") of the game as an agent of mine, I like to give advice on how to set up the gaming-situation, talk to the group, make use of body-face-hands to help game-play into the right mode, etc. I trust the buyers of my games to get the techniques I'm talking about, and have in fact seen both leaders and players grasp it quite quickly. <br><br>I do make use of mechanics too, in classical games, to lighten the burden of decision-making for the leader. In those designs the mechanics are good tools for nudging the narrative in unexpected directions, and for leaving the leader to focus on being the <i>narrator</i> of consequences, rather than the decider of failure/success.<br/><br/>So, Sam; let us return to your statement:<br/>- <i>"what you call the method can never be conveyed"</i>. <br/>As you may have seen already I have to refute it. I have done designs, and others have too, that proves this statement to be false. It is certainly possible to convey how a game shall be played. The method is all about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how a game is played</span>. Not telling your players that, when selling them a game, is a bit strange. Writing a method is all about telling the players how to make use of your game, and giving them the tools to do so. That must be done. I hope you agree to that.<br/><br/><b>On another tack ...</b><br/>I prefer designing modern role-playing games without mechanics. English speaking "indie"-designers prefer to design with mechanics of some sort. They have explored the field of mechanics thoroughly, and have unearthed a lot of interesting things that way, innovations which is a boon to role-playing games as a form. I love role-playing games, and would never been without the different "schools" of design around the world.<br/><br/>But I do believe that the time has come for the "Anglo school" to adopt a wider perspective now, by including more of the techniques I am talking about, when thinking and crafting new designs, whether their games are <i>classical</i> (leader + players) or <i>modern</i> (all are players).<br/><br/>I believe that playing down the use and importance of terms which comes with unfortunate connotations, is a good way to start widening the perspective. By bringing the terminology up to par with the full picture of what a role-playing game is (and how we all understand it to be, actually), we enables designers (and players) to seek out the future with more clarity and confidence.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367418/#Comment_367418" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T04:54:37+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  4:54AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To start with, the goal of my post was to show that your terminological critique was not a terminological critique, but a point against the use of mechanics in roleplaying games. Looks like that went swimmingly, which I guess opens up discussion for the real subject of the thread - whether or not mechanics are good. I would say useful, but you have already admitted that they come in handy at times. So the subject, I guess, is whether or not mechanics are what we <i>should be doing</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, though, I have to clarify my post because you have read me as having said some things I didn't intend to mean. When I say that method cannot be conveyed, I am not saying that no part of the method other than the mechanics can be conveyed. What I <i>am</i> saying is that some elements of the non-mechanical part of the method cannot be conveyed, and that like most texts and practices, the game will morph as it circulates and grows. As I said in my first post, we attempt to convey the way a game is played, its <i>rules</i>, the agreements that players reach around play, through text, speech or teaching. The method cannot, holistically, be conveyed, just as the fiction cannot leave the mind of the author and inhabit text. This doesn't stop us from attempting the feat, but recognising impossibility greatly improves out ability to graze against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether mechanical work in roleplaying games is useful is a pretty open question. I could be misinterpreting him, but I've had a conversation with David Berg in which he provided a pretty strong argument towards using mechanical rules to convey what you describe as <i>techniques</i> in game text. It's not something I do much myself, but I think that using rules to transmit teaching-by-interaction through text is a valid and useful idea. Similarly, I think that there is merit in deconstructing the game text into mechanical and other kinds of parts (e.g. setting, 'techniques', modifications, goals) to allow game elements to be more easily recombined and compared. We should also try to be aware of the presence of mechanics in our purportedly non-mechanical designs. Not because representing things as mechanical rules is inherently better, but rather that being able to nimbly re-represent designs is valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nProviding your players with useful suggestions for play is the subject of roleplaying game design and writing. Which suggestions need to be made and how they should be made is an entirely different subject. So, yes, usually if you believe that you have made a game, you want to tell your players how to play it. I have not made a singular game, and therefore the goal of my roleplaying work is to provide people with tools for playing <i>their game</i> using our group's ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367422/#Comment_367422" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T05:19:49+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  5:19AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><i>Mechanical</i>elements are part of it, yes, and<i>techniques</i>too.<b>The method</b>is a term to encompass both, and all other stuff that is part of<span style="text-decoration: underline;">how we play the game</span>.

However I DO have a problem with the attitude of some designers that think the way a game is played is totally up to the players and don't realize there's an important part they are leaving out of their rulesets. Understanding the way a game is played is of the utmost importance to actually enjoy it as it was designed, instead of inventing another way of playing it. Gary Gygax played old D&amp;D in a totally different way than first edition players did, since none of the techniques he used went public until he DMed at conventions.<br/><br/>So I say, hey try this out, let's use this terminology and see how much of your dreamed game you aren't explaining to the players, leaving them the work to come up with techniques on their own. I'd say in most cases they will bring to the table the ones they know from previous games you hate... which probably were the reason why you went through all the trouble of designing a new game.<br/><br/>But yes, the terminology is still a bit confusing. Let me see if I got it right:<br/><br/>-You give players RULES and ADVICE. The former is meant to be used in full, while the latter isn't neccesary to apply but could help.<br/>-The rules and advice are meant to convey MECHANICS -which are the dynamic relationship of procedures generated by the rules- and TECHNIQUES -which are guidelines for the interaction between players<br/>-Once the players get al least the basics of the mechanics and techniques and how they interrelate, they get a grasp of the METHOD, the way the designer meant the game to be played, and so they are actually ready to play and enjoy the game as the designer envisioned.<br/>-How that players use the method after that is up to them, they can generate their own house rules if they find the techniques are inssufficient or if the mechanics don't support a particular technique they are used to. And so in turn they can generate their own ADVICE.<br/>-Use the word SYSTEM again and Thomas will kick the crap out of you.<br/><br/>Ok, I added my two cents but I think I've got it - How far I am, Thomas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367599/#Comment_367599" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T13:03:06+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  1:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 1:03PM by biggles.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: biggles</cite>To start with, the goal of my post was to show that your terminological critique was not a terminological critique, but a point against the use of mechanics in roleplaying games.

You are right! Games have always morphed. They propose interactive procedures to the players, and the very nature of those procedures is <i>empowerment</i>; we the players are masters of the game. We are co-artists!<br/><br/>But the interactive nature of the game does not make the designer, nor the players, better off with inadequate and misleading terminology. It gives us a depth of engagement that is seldom found in other art-forms, and that engagement is an obligation. We are obliged to find good terms by the simple reason that we are so bloody engaged in this activity, and need to understand what it's all about.

Worse, we often read "system" and think "mechanics".<br/><br/>That said, I don't like the term "method". Firstly, because terminological debates never lead anywhere.

In your opinion, forum discussions have been dominated by the hard aspects of game design and you are trying to reintroduce the soft aspects of game design as an important aspect that needs to be consciously discussed.  If so, then maybe a better way to approach the problem is to categorize the word.  After reading the thread maybe you could break the hard and soft like this:<br/><br/>HARD: Rules (little instructions) -&gt; Mechanics (instructions put togther)  -&gt; System (the overall game, all the mechanics put together)<br/>SOFT: Tone/Advice -&gt; Techniques (??? still sounds "hard" to me) -&gt; Method.<br/><br/>*potential thread derail*<br/>In thinking about Hard/Soft, lets take something like draw Poker for an example.  At the start of a hand, the dealer collects the cards, makes sure they are all turned face down, shuffles them a few times, hands it to the guy on the right who cuts the deck, and then deals the cards one at a time starting with the player to the left until each player has 5 face down cards.  At firs glance this would look like a series of rules that encompasses the randomization mechanic for the game.  However, as specific as it sounds, there is actually a lot of soft information buried in there -- there is no particular reason you have to have the guy to the right cutting the deck...or really anyone cutting the deck, nor is there a requirement for any particular way of dealing the cards, but it sure as hell feels wrong to do it otherwise.  As such basic HARD mechanic is really this, randomize the cards and get 5 face down cards in front of each player.  And all that other stuff is SOFT stuff which if ignored would really hamper the playing experience.

We often think too much in terms of mechanics. Worse, we often read "system" and think "mechanics".</blockquote>Very good, Graham. The purpose of this thread is accomplished. I really want to introduce another perspective on here. What I am proposing is not just a single term, method, but a school of thinking that makes it easier to discover the design-possibilities within the field of dialogue-techniques; the real motor of any role-playing game. It is really the motor, much more so than any mechanics, and being that it is flabbergastingly little talked about. I believe the reason is that the psycho-social elements of dialogue makes is hard to grasp, much harder than the challenges of measuring how a die should affect a quantified paper-persona. Making good mechanics is a challenge, ja, but it presents a bleak challenge, in comparison to understanding and working the nuances of a dialogue in a gaming group.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite>I think you're fighting a losing battle here.</blockquote>I'm not fighting a battle, Peter. I do not <i>expect</i> a change to happen by me posting here, not a general change at least. I hope it will, but don't expect it to. But I do expect that someone will see the substance of these writings, like Graham above, and be better aware of how these things connects, and thus be able to apply another perspective to their game-play or design.<br/><br/><b>System</b> means "the way we play", and it means "mechanics", and it means "game". Some people says it means "the means by which the group agrees to imaginary events during play", but I do believe those are a tiny minority, and they are also battling the other ways of interpreting this term. That battle is lost again and again, leading to misreadings.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>As you define "method", Tomas, it seems like it flows from the game designer. It's everything you (the game designer) need to make the game work.</blockquote>I'm a designer, so it might well be that what I write reads like a designers perspective. I'm fine with that. What is the problem? Should I be more player than I am? LOL<br/><br/>It does not follow by that, that this term <i>method</i> is a "designers term". It's not everything a designer needs to make a game work. It is a term that can help players and designers alike to a better understanding of what they actually do:<br/>- by being a pliable term for discussing role-playing games on a certain level (the totality of how we play)<br/>and<br/>- by being a term that indicates more than the "system" or "mechanics" in use on that level at present. <br/>You still need to walk the walk, and you do have to explore the miles of "soft" ground in a wider understanding of the rpg-landscape. You need to "bog down" into the mire of psychosocial realities of dialogue. I expect designers to lead on in such a quest, and players to join in while contributing their particular perspective as an important corrective.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>For example, the quintaessential technique for roleplaying everybody uses and no one can tell exactly when they learned it is this:<br/>GM:"Now what do you do?"<br/>It has become practically a ritual as the universal prompt for player input.</blockquote>Yes. We play a simple game, actually. And yet; so complex! <br/><br/>The tools are simple, and we do have them in us already. Role-playing games would be impossible without human skill in communication; our training in improvising dialogue in every meeting with other humans, every day. Those skills are the true gist and motor of role-playing games. I purport to organize our thoughts on those skills, and make use of them in a conscious manner, so to make role-playing games play even better in the future.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!<br/><br/><i>BTW: I'm luckily married, so no marriage proposals will be expected.</i> LOL                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367775/#Comment_367775" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T00:28:53+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 12:28AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2012 12:29AM by biggles.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/>It will!

It gives us a depth of engagement that is seldom found in other art-forms, and that engagement is an obligation.

The kind of many-meaning-ness carried by these words is carried by most other words too. I bet you didn't know that "lamp" was both a verb meaning "to relax" and a term for a web server configuration.<br/><br/>I agree that the analysis of concepts is a useful activity in game design. I also think that looking at the way words are used is potentially a useful activity. I don't think that your particular criticisms are justified because I don't think that most people really do use [i]mechanics[/i] to refer to the totality of play. As for [i]system[/i] I think that it has taken on a double meaning, as I analysed above. I don't find the two uses of the word particularly confusing, but if you do, you could call the local sense the "immediate core mechanics" and the wider sense the "church" or "family".<br/><br/>A preferable approach to trying to come up with new and distinctive terminology for each analysed meaning of a word is to be clear about how you are using words when you use them and clarify when necessary. This is particularly helpful when dealing with people who don't necessarily know the jargon your design tradition is fond of. The body of research on games is wide enough as it is. Between the computer scientists, the literary theorists and the philosophers, I think we have enough obscure terminology as it is.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite><br/>For example, the quintaessential technique for roleplaying everybody uses and no one can tell exactly when they learned it is this:<br/>GM:"Now what do you do?"<br/>It has become practically a ritual as the universal prompt for player input.

I'm sure there should be more than one, but I can't recall a precise chapter in any of the ones I've readed) Now, if as a designer you take advantage of this knowledge and hack this technique and more, how many possibilities do you think that adds to the field of RPG design?<br/>And that was just a Technique.</blockquote>\nBelieve it or not, I first found out this existed about a month ago when I read the rules to Apocalypse World. We don't do it. I actually thought Vincent invented it until right now. Firm sounding and all that, but people tend to take the usual conversational cues for input just as well. I guess if you were used to waiting until you were asked "What do you do?", you might not slip into a game where you're expected to respond to conversational pauses in description so well?

I think the bigger terminological problem with eliminating a word from usage is that there is a reason why everyone is using the word.  Even if it is being used sloppily, the original makes intuitive sense to a lot of people and they find it a convenient vehicle for conveying concepts as they read and write.  Just pulling the rug out from  under everybody and replacing it with another word that is in just as ambiguous (in part due to the new term's newness) doesn't necessarily help clarify discussion.<br/><br/>I think it would better to add a word (<i>method</i>) and then redefine the existing word (<i>system</i>) using this new pairing to create the more nuance/logical/etc. distinction that you want to create (<i>now that we have this duality of method vs system we can now compare and contrast these two concepts</i>).<br/><br/>edit:  There would be one exception to the suggestion above.  If you are trying to BREAK the a way of thought then a word replacement would be appropriate.  For example I find the discussion confusing in part because I think of mechanics as a collection of rules, and furthermore I think of system as a collection of mechanics, as such its a very convenient and logical set of definitions, even if other people use it sloppily.  Now if your polemic is that there is no such thing as a pure "system" of collected "mechanics" untainted by "techniques"; then deleting the existing word and replacing it with a new one would make sense (eg it impossible to collect mechanics alone a combined set of mechanics will always include techniques, I call this collection "method").  But that wasn't how the proposal was framed, though I think Sam suspected that was where you were headed in an earlier reply.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_367808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367808/#Comment_367808" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T05:48:17+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  5:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not "eliminating"; <i>limiting</i> the use so it does not carries all the misreadings and faulty thinking.<br/><br/>I'm using <b>mechanics</b> for the mechanics of a game; dice rolling, number crunching, leveling.

This thread is me trying to help clarify the situation, in my small way.<br/><br/><i>BTW: change is a challenge to all, any which way you look at it, but the challenge is greater for those adamant about change being impossible.</i> ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367826/#Comment_367826" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T07:09:01+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  7:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, you know I'm already on board with the sort of linguistic distinction you're advocating for in this thread.<br/><br/>Having said that, where to now with the concept covered by method+ low mechanics roleplaying/story-gaming?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rubbermancer" title="Rubbermancer"><img alt="Rubbermancer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rubbermancer">Rubbermancer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367900/#Comment_367900" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T11:49:32+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 11:49AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2012 11:50AM by Rubbermancer.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have two cents:<br/><br/>1) I've always used "system" the way you use (or propose to use) "method".

This is called the "Lumpley Principle". ("System constitutes of the means by which the group agrees upon the fiction of the game", as it's often phrased.) This idea has some recognition out there, so saying that "system" is the same as " game mechanics" is probably going to confuse some people otherwise interested in this sort of thing, unless you're careful to specify your different meaning. Of course, I'm sure that there are plenty of others who find it important that "system" needs to be a merely mechanical term that ignores technique of play. This wouldn't do as an universal generalization, but my experience is that traditional gamers usually understand "system" to be limited to mechanics; this is because they normally play games that do not address methodology of play, so for most of the games they play the method or technique or whatever truly is not part of the <i>game's</i> "system"; rather, the player brings whatever methodology he might have from one game to another, translating his expertise but swapping the mechanical parts of the game. A game written like this truly is method-empty, it just assumes that you bring in the traditional method that is shared between the games. The method and technique are not the game's, but rather the player's. (This is why traditional GMing advice is universal and transferrable between games: those games are all built to play the same way.)<br/><br/>Assuming for the sake of the argument that you accept my above characterization of trad gamer terminology usage, you'll note that the traditional gamer still intends to use "system" as a word that describes the entire game. The only other word he routinely uses is "setting" or "fluff", indicating the imaginative base material the system operates on. Many say that a complete game consists of a system+setting (or system and a variable fictive base of play, as a more analytical person might term it). It's notable that what "system" still means here is the totality of the game proper (in the sense that I'm ignoring the setting for this argument - neither game mechanics nor methodology are part of the setting, for sure). Thus we can say that both the Forge theorist and the traditional gamer use "system" to mean the same thing: the entire structure that forms the game's interactive parts. One of those just postulates that a game's system strictly speaking is not limited to mechanics, but also involves procedures, goals, techniques and methods - or at least may involve, even if some games texts don't. In this regard I don't see a substantial difference between the layman's usage and the Forge usage, the difference lies in what the two expect a game text to provide.<br/><br/>For the above reasons I don't particularly recommend using "system" in a narrow manner. It's probably more confusing than having to remind people sometimes that say prestocking dungeons is part of the D&amp;D system as written even if it's optional and doesn't necessarily involve dicing (that's an example of a non-mechanical technique of GM prep that most people would call part of the "D&amp;D system", by the way). I am obviously biased, being used to how the Forge uses these words, but when I need to choose, I find the Forge standard terminology pretty easy on the eyes: "system" for the causally relevant structure that determines the changes to the play-state, "game mechanic" for the parts of system that are defined and mandated objectively for the procedure of play, and "method" or "technique" for optional skill-element heuristics the players may opt to use in fulfilling the tasks the mechanics of the game mandate to them. Good enough to get by for me.<br/><br/>To clarify, I understand that Tomas wants to use<ul><li>"system" to mean what is usually (at the Forge) called "mechanics",</li><li>"method" for the usual "system"</li><li>and "technique" for what would be called a "method" or "procedure" - or indeed, "technique".</li></ul>As far as I can see, he's just moving words around and complaining that the usual terminology clouds meaning and causes people to ignore soft methodology of play as a venue of design. Maybe this is true, or maybe different linguistic backgrounds make people see different nuances in these words. I don't really care, as long as I can understand what's being said substantially.<br/><br/>Instead of terminological reforms, I'd recommend people to invest more in reading comprehension. You're not going to solve the clarity of communication problem from the active side; basically, if the audience can't actively match your words against meaning, then there simply are not unambiguous enough words in a natural language for making yourself understood. Understanding is a two-way road, and my experience is that I see many more oblivious audiences than ill-communicating talkers. So focus on having something to say, read others charitably (absolute key to full literacy, by the way - your goal should be to understand others better, not to complain that they're writing badly) and worry about inventing new terminology or defining the old when you really have something to say that requires such care. Terminological definition for the sake of it is useless, there's no other way to say it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_367951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367951/#Comment_367951" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T15:59:59+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  3:59PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 1:20AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok!<br/><br/>Some simple examples:<br/><br/>As a leader of a game;<br/><b>Start by shaking hands with each and every player</b><br/>Effect: establishing a private space between you ...<br/>- makes you focus on and evaluate the player; helps you communicate during game-play<br/>- makes the player trust in your authority, as you are ready to meet him eye-to-eye<br/>- grows mutual respect between you<br/><br/>As a player of a game;<br/><b>Listen in on scenes of other players</b><br/>Effect: strengthening the shared interactive space ...<br/>- makes the game run smoothly; less catch-up dialogue is needed<br/>- makes the players feel that <i>their scenes, dialogues and actions</i> are valued by others<br/>- establish <i>the game</i> as focal point of the evening<br/><br/>As a leader of a game;<br/><b>Touch a player in interaction</b><br/>Effect: triggering automatic emotional response ...<br/>- strengthens emotional content of fiction<br/>- widens the interactive field of the game, <br/>- deepens immersion in character<br/><br/>As a player of a serious game; <br/><b>Close your eyes and calm yourself before game-start</b><br/>Effect: introducing the game as a "different space" ...<br/>- awaken imaginative powers<br/>- creates expectation of something special<br/>- brings you out of everyday life, into game-mode<br/><br/>As you see; quite simple techniques.

Absolutely!<br/><br/>As for the:<br/>- invent terms when you need them<br/>I hope you do not see me as a mere dabbler in words. I have invented terms to suit my perspective on role-playing games. It has great meaning to me, and helps me a lot both as a designer and as a professional leader of games. I do not expect all to see my perspective, to accept it as something of worth, or to adopt it for themselves. Still; I talk of it here in the hope that it may help others to some insights.<br/><br/>My perspective is carefully developed through decades of discussing role-playing games, and made simpler as I got more into it. There is a clarity to the system of terms I present here, even though that may elude those reading it for the first time. Let me try to say some more on it ...<br/><br/>The fundament is the simple three-step model of role-playing games:<br/><b>Vision -&gt; Interaction -&gt; Fiction</b><br/><br/>The steps may be phrased like this too:<br/><i>Design -&gt; Gaming -&gt; Impact</i><br/><br/>Or they may be phrased thus:<br/><i>Invention -&gt; Execution -&gt; Effect</i><br/><br/><b>The Vision</b><br/>The first step is where the designer and the leader of a game is active, setting the goal for the game, and inventing/planning/writing down the means to reach it. A well written game book presents the vision of the game with clarity, engage the players in it, and lists up the means necessary to reach it (the method).<br/><br/><b>The Interaction</b><br/>The second step is where game takes place, with the leader and/or the players in interaction. This is where the mechanics and/or techniques are put to use, and where the elements of the setting is included in game-play. This is the melting pot of the game, where it forms into great wonders, or melt away. A well functioning role-playing game enables the players to create a shared interactive space, in which they can work the wonders of the game.<br/><br/><b>The Fiction</b><br/>The third step is where each and every player of a game find their fruits of the game; the impact of it; the effect it has on them; the fiction they bring with them from the table. It is an individual narrative/experience/state, that is related to other players through the shared interactive space it is created in. It is the goal of the game, a fiction that, when it is at its best, is vividly alive in the mind of the player.<br/><br/>I hope this clarify some of the things I'm talking about.

I was just explaining why I don't see this as much a pressing issue - I'll use whatever words are necessary for a given theoretical model, but I'll only use the model if it's useful for real purposes, you know? But definitely, if your terminology works for you, then that's just great.

I am trying to give back some of my insights to a forum that has given me much through the years. I am, in spite of being geographically far removed from most of you, concerned about the way a lot of people here still seems to be "stuck in words".<br/><br/>Comic relief:<br/><i>- Are you suffering a severe case of mechanical arthritis?<br/>- Call technical support, and we will soften your imagination!</i><br/><br/>I do not expect people like you, Eero, with your theoretical ballast, to be in much need of my help. But I do see that a lot of people would be better off if I could communicate this perspective to them in an effective way. I'm trying to help you open the left eye too, so you may experience the glorious world of in-depth-sight. I have tried to do so before too, and will probably continue to do so so <i>Until We Sink</i> into oblivion ...<br/><br/>I'm that kind of strange bugger. Please forgive me.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I myself usually concern myself with design goals in tandem with<i>productization</i>, meaning the delivery of the game. This is an important step for difficult performative games like rpgs, obviously.</blockquote>Yes, really. I'm in full agreement with you on this. Hard not to be.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In terms of designing and transferring knowledge of method, do you think that swinging the spotlight a bit more over onto the methods side of thigs alters the way we look at what mechanics are?</blockquote>Aside from the "methods side" (the method being the whole thing, not a side), I have experienced that yes, it does. Having adopted the idea of techniques being as important as mechanics, made me look at mechanics in new ways too, both in classical (leader + players) and modern (all players) design. It has helped me big time in developing my classical fantasy role-playing game <i>Fabula</i>. In my many modern games it has opened up whole new venues of design, enabling me to explore methods geared towards engaging and empowering the players in new ways. I'm only just beginning to taste the fruits of this long labour now.<br/><br/>I have not been alone in exploring this. Far from it; much of my insights I owe to my peers here in Norway. Our small and tight design-miliieu has developed a whole new tool-set of techniques, for both classical and modern games. Most important for me in this regard has been the game "<b>Until We sink</b>" by Magnus Jakobson, a piece of really groundbreaking design. The games by Matthijs Holter; "<b>Archipelago</b>" and "<b>The Society of Dreamers</b>", has left a big impression on players too, and with good reason; them helping players to soar about in the heavens of imagination. The classical game "<b>Itras City</b>", by Gi\xe6ver and Gudmundsen, has really found a fan-base with its open and playful method geared towards urban surrealism. <br/><br/>These are games that turns the table, so to speak. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>So, Tomas, how do you get a GM to start with handshakes and touch during interactions, and how do you get players to close their eyes pre-game and listen to each other's scenes, when you yourself are not present?</blockquote>Oh, David! Woe to ye of little faith! I simply write game texts where I tell them to do it, while carefully explaining why, and telling how it can affect the game in a positive way. I place the tools in a well though of method, and do my best to convey how it may be used. How do you make players play <i>your</i> games, David?<br/><br/>The written word is, with all its inaccuracies and limitations, a wonderful tool of communication! And if the text don't get my players to do all I say ...<br/>- well; role-playing games have always been about players reading a game-book for inspiration, and then to start wandering off on their own. Players always recreate the method to their own taste, they pick the berries and leave the thorns, and make up things along the way. I'm fine with that. Being a rpg-designer is hard if you insist that players should not play about with your game ...

As far as I can tell, most folks here started roleplaying with classical games like D&amp;D2, Vampire, and Shadowrun, all of which absolutely do what you describe.<br/><br/>Vampire, for example, suggests the GM developing a theme for each session, and explains how this can bring extra oomph to play.  For a variety of reasons, such instructions tended not to be milked for all they were worth, or even used at all.  Maybe because there were too many of them; maybe because they were buried amid flavor text.  But clearly, <i>one</i> of the reasons they were forgotten was because of the lack of mandate and reward.  As opposed to the combat mechanics, which, while arguably not as beneficial to sustainably satisfying play, were concrete, mandatory, and got you successes and failures that compelled you to do it again (usually).<br/><br/>I suspect many folks here are in my position: what you're describing is familiar to me, and I've seen it fail a lot, so I'm wondering how what you do is different.  Maybe the specific methods you offer give more immediate proof of their effectiveness than Vampire's GM advice?  Maybe your methods are easier to find in the book, and remember at the table?  Maybe you are more concrete about how to put your methods into practice?  What do you think?<br/><br/>I like a lot of the methods you've described on this forum, but I somewhat despair of actually putting them to use.  I feel like I'd need to mandate an intensive training session first, where we do <i>nothing but</i> close eyes, shake hands, touch and listen, to ingrain the behaviors.  Because without that, I'm certain most of the gamers I've ever played with would simply forget that stuff and default to whatever they normally do in the midst of roleplay.\n<blockquote>How do you make players play <i>your</i> games, David?</blockquote>I've never had someone play one of my games without playing it with me first, so I can't speak from experience here.  What I'd <i>like</i> to do is hand them something about as accessible as your average board game or party game, which quickly shows how everything you do earns you progress in the game.\n<blockquote>role-playing games have always been about players reading a game-book for inspiration, and then to start wandering off on their own.</blockquote>I'd certainly never hope to <i>force</i> someone into not wandering... but I would hope to give them all they need, so they don't <i>have</i> to wander off on their own unless they <i>want</i> to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_368029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368029/#Comment_368029" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T01:08:46+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  1:08AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 1:18AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They really want to. Believe me.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right, David; these <i>techniques</i> are in use by all role-players all over the world. There is no way of playing a role-playing game without techniques for characterization, dialogue, story-telling and leadership. It is largely done by intuition, and by using everyday skills in dialogue and socialization. But advice on such techniques has been a part of rpg-texts since the dawn of this form too, in all the games you mention, and most of the rest. <br/><br/>But these <i>techniques</i> have been, as you correctly observe, a forgotten child of the form. Little spoken of, largely ignored as an element of study and discussion, and as a consequence; crippled in growth alongside the healthy child of <i>Mechanics</i> (yes, really; the mechanical side of it is indeed healthy! We have done wonders on the mechanical side of role-playing design, especially in the "indie" part of Anglo-American design-culture). It's time to give the <i>techniques</i> more appreciation now; to observe and explore their possibilities; to describe and share them; to make an effort bringing <i>techniques</i> into full growth, as a design- and game-tool.<br/><br/>I'm a professional story-teller too, so that may be one reason I'm the one riding this horse. As a story-teller I'm well aware of techniques used to engage an audience, to ...<br/>- make words come alive in their imagination<br/>- evoke their emotion<br/>- create a meaningful dialogue<br/>- lead troublesome kids and adults into constructive narrative territory<br/>- etc. <br/>Much of what I do is internalized and intuitive, but having done this for years now, and being a leader of rpgs at the same time, I have started to see some techniques for what they really are; practical tools that anyone can use.<br/><br/>It has a lot to do with experience, of course, but any designer or leader of role-playing games can be told what these tools are, and may put them to good use. Knowing about them is half the voyage towards using them. And having them organized in a well conceived method, makes a lot of difference to a lot of game-leaders and players. By simple means they enter a whole new realm of possibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_368031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368031/#Comment_368031" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T01:33:39+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  1:33AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 1:34AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>Tomas, I am interested when these methods are made into rules.. becoming part of the game and not just player skills.</blockquote>I've said something on that in the post above.\n<blockquote><cite>Shaking the hands for example could be a ritual.</cite></blockquote>Shaking hands is, in fact, a ritual. It is an age old ritual for greeting people you meet, to show them you are a honest man that will treat them with respect. Giving your hand and name is a sign, a treaty, that you will treat them justly, and that you trust them to do the same. It's a detail of ordinary life that we do not think much of, and that is going out of use, but that has ramifications we need to understand. <br/><br/>We need to understand why our forefathers did such things, and put so much weight on behaving like this. People meeting strangers with a short "hi", not giving their name or hand, is actually presenting themselves in a very bad way. They hold back when they should come forth, and that makes a meeting lack in trust and meaning. They are adding to a growing distrust between people in a society. The society/fellowship/brotherhood of men is created by such small things, each and every day. Fellowship is not something we have; it is something we do.

The purpose of this thread is accomplished. I really want to introduce another perspective on here. What I am proposing is not just a single term, method, but a school of thinking that makes it easier to discover the design-possibilities within the field of dialogue-techniques; the real motor of any role-playing game. It is really the motor, much more so than any mechanics, and being that it is flabbergastingly little talked about. I believe the reason is that the psycho-social elements of dialogue makes is hard to grasp, much harder than the challenges of measuring how a die should affect a quantified paper-persona. Making good mechanics is a challenge, ja, but it presents a bleak challenge, in comparison to understanding and working the nuances of a dialogue in a gaming group.</blockquote>\nOk, if the dialogue techniques really are the motor of role-playing games, I'd like to see some examples of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_368049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368049/#Comment_368049" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T03:18:35+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  3:18AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 3:49AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>Ok, if the dialogue techniques really are the motor of role-playing games, I'd like to see some examples of them.</blockquote>The techniques are more or less present in normal dialogue too, but as role-playing games are, in fact, <i>ritualized interaction</i>, you use techniques of characterization, dialogue, story-telling and leadership to make it happen along the lines that leads to inspired fiction. To master that you need to know what you do, and describing/defining/inventing effective techniques of dialogue is part of that.<br/><br/>I hope this clarifies it a bit, Eero Laine?<br/><br/><b>Examples:</b><br/>Talking "toneless": conveys a weird atmosphere<br/>Talking low: conveys an excited/threatening atmosphere<br/>Talking fast, demanding answers: conveys urgency, creates stress<br/><br/><b>An example of more elaborate technique, with a leader of a classical game combining tools:</b><br/>She is starting out by talking fast in a critical action scene, driving up tempo, demanding the players to make decisions with a sketchy idea of what is happening, holding them to their first words, or leaving them as confused if not answering right away, and giving brutal consequences in either case, based on how their dice rolls or on circumstance ...<br/>- and then she stops up completely. The crisis is over. They have survived. And she tells them this in a soft voice. She is completely calm now, and treat the players with obvious sympathy, letting them grope about in the aftermath of stress, sinking into the empty space of reflection. She asks calm and directed questions to help them to talk/think/feel the impact of the brutal action, and make good time doing this. The action need time to sink in and spill out ...<br/>- and then ...<br/>(the game continues)<br/><br/><i>The tools at play in the example above:<br/>- Characterization: she drives the players into an action-frenzy, triggering immersion in stress, shock and brutal self-preservation<br/>- Dialogue: brutal dialogue mimics brutal action<br/>- Story-telling: talking fast conveys urgency<br/>- Story-telling: shifts in tempo leaves the players with reverberations, and mental "lag"<br/>- Dialogue: calm and directed questions helps players reflect on character-impact<br/>- Characterization: she shows the players sympathy, triggering immersion in self-pity, bitterness and/or healing<br/>- Leadership: driving up tempo, demanding initiative, leaving stragglers behind .. all this mimics crisis<br/>- Leadership: using voice to entice players to answer in kind; first brutal and then softly, sets a shifting tone of interaction between the players that supports the drama</i><br/><br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368116/#Comment_368116" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T10:26:22+00:00" title="March 16, 2012 10:26AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 10:27AM by wyrmwood.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, I'm mostly busy in other frontiers, but I'd like to see better analysis of this sort of thing.<br/><br/>Some brief notes on where you are and where you could go further:<br/><br/>1) It is important to that in most play there is a significant flow between rules, mechanics, and game structure on one side, and cognitive cues, dialogue techniques, and emotional responses on the other. You risk missing much of that if you artificially segregate these sides of play.<br/><br/>2) Story-telling and body language techniques are powerful, but in many cases they are acting as just a subset of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_%28psychology%29" rel="nofollow">priming</a> during play. Looking at priming in RPGs is possibly one of the most important analysis directions we can take right now, but at present it seems ancillary to your "revolution". It could be a very deep well of discovery.<br/><br/>3) Don't neglect verbal techniques, while enumerating voice and body techniques. How a particular piece of speech is phrased, and the underlying rules and guidelines for guiding it's construction offers a wealth of dialogue techniques. Apocalypse World's "address yourself to characters, not players" is just the tip of the iceberg. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368147/#Comment_368147" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T13:58:55+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  1:58PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, thanks for your response, it makes sense to me, and I agree.  It would be cool to have more focus on dialogue techniques and other neglected methods.  I just wish I could see a more effective way to create that focus via games themselves.<br/><br/>It seems relevant to mention Puppetland here.  Players may only speak in-character.  GM speaks only in the past tense.  The dialogue techniques are the rules are the game, and it is a good one.<br/><br/>There's a variant of Delve I've experimented with, where every time the players speak, they start with "I" and then announce what their character does.  The standard phrases a player uses to gather info from the GM are replaced with "I survey the area", "I look for (whatever you hope to find)", and "I try to judge if (whatever you're considering would work)".  This technique can get in the way of some of the game's other goals, so I've ditched it (at least for now), but when I did use it, it was very effective at creating the orientation I wanted, and it was pretty easy to drive home, by:<br/>1) putting the phrasing options ("I survey", "I look for _", etc.) in a highly visible place on the character sheet, and <br/>2) always re-stating as GM any player input outside convention.  "Dave, are there any large rocks around?"  "You look for large rocks?  Okay, you see some by the alcove."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Mechanics?

Perhaps it's just too soon and I'm also wondering if this field has been explored before using another different term. Anyway, I insist that about the techniques part what we are looking for is somewhere hidden among the lines of Social Psychology studies. Priming is actually part of that area, but Social Psychology focuses more around how it's used in human interaction than on the ways each individual processes it internally, which are more closer to what we are looking for.<br/><br/>The first problem I've found when trying to define what could be considered a technique and what not is that we are talking about tools humans use to interact with each other. Gestures, noises, spoken words, signs and icons are the raw material for building these tools. From the universe of possibilities of human comunication we want to extract only those tools that are pertinent to gaming and focusing it more, the ones we could use for playing RPGs.<br/><br/>The tools we're looking for are among the ones we use to <b>tell stories</b> but there is also an important amount of tools that belong to the field of <b>negotiation</b><br/><br/>Things like framing scenes, using body language to help ellicit emotions in the players, keeping them focused and setting a pace to the narration are part of storytelling. We aren't going here into how to make stories, just into the part of how to tell them to other people and help them feel a part of the fiction, in the emotional sense.<br/><br/>Things like paying atenttion to players flags, the witch mountain trick, worldbuilding with the players, GM fiat, plot points, passing the spotlight, etc are different ways to approach negotiation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_368164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368164/#Comment_368164" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T15:39:34+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  3:39PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>1) It is important to that in most play there is a significant flow between rules, mechanics, and game structure on one side, and cognitive cues, dialogue techniques, and emotional responses on the other. You risk missing much of that if you artificially segregate these sides of play.</blockquote><i>Flow</i> is something to strive for in any game, whatever the balance between mechanics and techniques are.<br/><br/>There is no artificial segregation here; only a way of organizing our thoughts on role-playing games, so that we may understand better the methods we play by. The term <i>method</i> in itself, comprising both mechanics and techniques, indicates that we are talking totality here.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>2) Story-telling and body language techniques are powerful, but in many cases they are acting as just a subset of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_%28psychology%29" rel="nofollow">priming</a>during play.

It could be a very deep well of discovery.</blockquote>Priming seems to be interesting. Techniques being a "sub-set" of this is something you will have to explain.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>3) Don't neglect verbal techniques, while enumerating voice and body techniques. How a particular piece of speech is phrased, and the underlying rules and guidelines for guiding it's construction offers a wealth of dialogue techniques. Apocalypse World's "address yourself to characters, not players" is just the tip of the iceberg.</blockquote>that's very sound advice, for both leader and players. It should be adhered to as much as possible.<br/><br/>And it ties back to the first point you made, Mendel; the one about <i>flow</i>. Having mechanics taking too much time and focus, makes it harder to maintain character-speak. That is a challenge I've met mostly in classical games; they tend to have mechanics which are prominent in play. Modern role-playing games, at least of the Norwegian style, is geared more towards techniques, and as a consequence they tend to present fewer obstacles to fluent and inventive character-speak. In some of these games there is little meta-speak at all, only short narrations and in-game character talk.<br/><br/> It is easier to go into interactive flow with "softer" methods. That is one thing I find very refreshing in modern games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368218/#Comment_368218" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T05:53:52+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  5:53AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><i>Flow</i>is something to strive for in any game, whatever the balance between mechanics and techniques are.</blockquote>\nTomas, I wasn't talking about <i>flow</i> in the sense of a highly focused activity, but in the sense that (in essence) as play evolves among a group or even a community mechanics can become dialogue techniques and vice versa. <br/><br/>On the other hand, in my experience this isn't always true:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>It is easier to go into interactive flow with "softer" methods.</blockquote>\nRemember not all minds are the same.

The fiction of the game is created directly by the dialogue, so the techniques are very close to the creation of the fiction.<br/>- <b>Mechanics</b> are how we use tools outside of the diealogue (dice, coins, cards, tables, character-statistics, etc.). They affect the dialogue (resolving conflicts, indicating consequences, distributing narration-rights, etc.), but not as directly/seamlessly as the techniques. So the mechanics are one more step removed from the fiction, compared to the techniques. <br/><br/>This distinction in nature between <i>techniques</i> and <i>mechanics</i> is of utmost importance. To understand these two central parts of the methodology of role-playing games, we need to accept that they are indeed very different. They do have a very different function in the methodology, and work in very different ways. The way they affect the interaction is different, and the way they relate to the fiction is different.<br/><br/>So let us, please, "segregate" them a bit in discussion. No insight is possible without differential thinking on this.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Remember not all minds are the same.</blockquote>They are, basically. If you want to design effective techniques for leaders and players of role-playing games to use, you need to discard the popular myth that every soul and body is unique. We are, in spite of having distinct personalities, basically the same. We have instincts and automated reactions that are the same, through millenniums of human developments. We are animals, and are affected by certain stimulus as animals. The nuances of reactions are not frequent enough, nor large enough, to be of importance in game-design.<br/><br/>Knowing this, and exploring how it works, is an important part of being a rpg-designer, at least if you want to design games for the future. You need knowledge of how people work to design better games, especially within the realm of <i>dialogue techniques</i>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Personally, I've found some modes of focused character speak break the character intensive flow much more than communicating in "mechanics-speak".</blockquote>Whatever you do, you are not guaranteed <i>flow</i> in a game. However; it is easier to obtain flow in games with better dialogue techniques, as they in general are geared towards strengthening in-character focus (immersion).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>It is very easy for me to go between emotions, abstractions, and concrete events, in many ways a good mechanic is closer to what I'm thinking than constructing dialogue or otherwise acting the part.

For that I'd prefer to communicate in mechanics and unaffected dialogue.</blockquote>I'd like to underline that I do not consider the character-exploration we do in role-playing games to be "acting". Several experiences with <i>acting vs role-play</i> has led me to think that these two build on very different premises. <br/>In short:<br/>- acting is communicating a pre-made character/dialogue<br/>- role-play is exploring character-possibilities in free dialogue<br/><br/>Actors do use "role-play" as a tool for training, but still they go at their characters differently than genuine role-players. I find it interesting to see how some role-players can cry out their actions in a game with great bravado, but suck on a scene. And the opposite; I find it interesting to see how some actors can shine on the scene, but still suck in portraying their character in a role-playing game. Funny world, eh?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>My brain almost certainly works differently than yours, so I don't doubt for you (and many others), your statement is true. So just remember not to simply generalize how your own mind works to everyone else.</blockquote>As said; not true. Our bodies and brains works alike, basically. Intellectual positions are superfluous in regard to this, Mendel.

For me, I feel like Polaris and Apocalypse World have been the most <i>visibly</i> technique-heavy games I've played.<br/><br/>That being said, I am wrestling with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>-<b>Techniques</b>are based on dialogue. The fiction of the game is created directly by the dialogue.<br/>-<b>Mechanics</b>are based on some element outside of our body (dice, coins, cards, etc.). They only affect the fiction through the dialogue (describing consequences), so the mechanics are one additional step removed from the fiction, compared to the techniques.</blockquote>\nI tend to think of it as: <br/>- techniques are the basic building blocks of play: they tell you how to approach play. Unfurl the sail, put the boat in water (not in that order, haha) and you're ready for some boating!<br/>- mechanics are a kind of technique that you employ only in certain circumstances, usually when there's an uncertain outcome or a conflict of interests (in the fiction or among the players+GM). They are like contingency techniques. To continue the boating analogy, they're more like the flare gun, the first aid kit, and the Coast Guard's emergency phone number. <br/><br/>So, we always need techniques. They give gameplay its basic shape, compared to other games. Sometimes we need mechanical techniques to give us some guidance as to where to go or what to do next. <br/><br/>In the Anglo game design world, techniques have gotten short shrift til quite recently, but all games have both mechanical and non-mechanical techniques. Even games that never require randomization can still provide guidance for conflict - Drama and Karma mechanics are still mechanics, after all, even if they don't employ random numbers. <br/>I suppose that phrase "contingency techniques" is really where it's at - generally speaking, techniques like "always role-play dialogue" or "make the world seem real" are a lot less dependent on sharply defined circumstances of play, compared to mechanical techniques like "when two characters are competing over something, have each player say why their character deserves it more. The group as a whole + GM should vote on the outcome".<br/><br/>Moves are a really strong, clear approach to mechanics for this precise reason: it is understood a) that they are contingent techniques and b) their pre-requisite "conditions" are usually quite readily apparent.<br/><br/>Augh the acting vs. roleplay distinction is really good! But it doesn't line up with improv - improvisational actors consider themselves, well, actors, even though they don't employ pre-made dialogue or characters. Thoughts?<br/><br/>Lastly: the brain stuff? I mean, sure, not all techniques will work for everyone, ever, independent of one's personal neurological circumstances. But I consider that to have less to do with neurology and more to do with taste, genre/tone preferences, and previous gaming experience (which determines what techniques are more or less of a challenge for a given individual).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_368232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368232/#Comment_368232" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T08:52:38+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  8:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2012 8:55AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Zac!

(for being such a slow pedant)<br/><br/>As for placing mechanics as a subset of techniques; you are right in doing so. But for the sake of dicussion; let us keep them level, while discerning between them. <br/><br/>Mind you; to place techniques and mechanics at the same level in a method, at least has some merit when talking about classical rpgs (games with leader + players). Mechanics are very prominent in most classical games, including <i>Apocalypse World</i> and <i>Polaris</i> (as far as I know; I have read the one, and only read about the other). I find it useful to think of mechanics as something outside the realm of techniques. And it is certainly a lot closer to the opinion held by most players of classical rpgs.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>Augh the acting vs. roleplay distinction is really good!

She is of course breaking up the divide I'm setting up here, and thus she makes me stumble in my orderly way of looking at the world. Ah, you cannot trust anyone these days! LOL<br/><br/>But in general I hold my observation to be true, still, and one that may explain a lot of things if you move about in the muddy fields between theatre and role-playing games (as me and my daughter do a lot).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>compared to mechanical techniques like "when two characters are competing over something, have each player say why their character deserves it more. The group as a whole + GM should vote on the outcome".</blockquote>This is a technique of leadership and communication, not of mechanics.<br/><br/>I believe you are clouding the issue a bit, Zac, but that is ok. I do agree with you that there are movements in current design that indicates a greater consciousness of how techniques and mechanics interrelates, and how a method may be designed with the balance tipping the one way, or the other. Having some methods tipping to the side of stronger dialogue-techniques, opens up the field for other designers too. They play the games, and find them to work well, and see for themselves how this may be. Matthijs Holter and Jason Morningstar have done some great work in this respect, in my view.<br/><br/>As for discussing <i>techniques</i> and <i>mechanics</i> as two important parts of <b>the rpg methodology</b>;<br/>- I hope I have served my definitions in a clear manner, and that I have given you a glimpse of the full picture (vision - interaction - fiction). In spite of this being new to most of the readers here, I hope you see that the full picture is in fact quite simple.

It makes us stand forth with a rainbow of personalities. But still; on the level of <i>automated responses</i> we differ very little. That is where the remnants of our animal brain is the most active, still, as the level where instincts and emotional impulses originates. And those are of utmost importance when working the communicative field of role-playing games. <br/><br/>We all do it, conscious or not. What I do here, is to propose form us to do it with conscious direction, trying to "level up" the way we design/play our games, inventing and exploring techniques until we succeed, and to replicate the successful effects in game after game after game ...<br/><br/>There are layers to any communication; intellectual, symbolical, emotional. Engaging players in several of these layers are not something we have to do, but I find that doing it makes a game all the more potent, and fun. And that is within reach of effective dialogue techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368276/#Comment_368276" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T16:44:49+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  4:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's all about the Venn diagram - mechanics are techniques, but techniques are not all mechanics.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>This is a technique of leadership and communication, not of mechanics.</blockquote>\nAfter close-reading, I see that "leader" is a broader term that includes "game master" within itself.

Most conflicts in role-playing games feeds into the fiction through dialogue techniques, you know. <br/><br/>I have made my system of terms to clarify the divide between <i>mechanics</i> and <i>techniques</i>, to make it easier for me (and possibly; you) to understand that any method of role-playing games consist of these elements, and to study how they interrelate, and work in unison, to bring us great game-play. I have found it very conductive on my thinking, and on my design-ability, to have this system of terms as a fundament for my rpg-work. <br/><br/>On <i>leadership</i> you are right; both leadership and the other terms included in <i>techniques</i> (dialogue, story-telling, etc.) indeed covers what a game-leader do, in a classical game (and more; they covers what the players do too). In a modern game there is no game-leader, but still the techniques apply, of course (there is no way to conceive a role-playing games without techniques of dialogue and leadership). Even the techniques of <i>leadership</i> is present in such games; they tend to be softer, and tend to be distributed more or less firmly/floating around the table. <br/><br/>But as said; the role of game-leader in classical games is very much covered in this system of terms. I have found that thinking like this has given me valuable new insights on how the leader works a game and a group. It has been a long road, with lots of experimental scenarios, using new techniques which were more or less successful, with other GMs testing them for me too (in public scenarios, at conventions). <br/><b>The long road of exploration has unearthed new ways for a leader to...</b><br/>- frame a game<br/>- helping a group into the right mood<br/>- elicit emotional responses amongst players<br/>- adapt the use of mechanics to the situation<br/>- work tempo, and especially shifts of tempo, to great effect<br/>- set up conflict without mechanics, and push those conflicts towards crisis<br/>- work <i>conflict</i> and <i>crisis</i> as separate phases of game-play<br/>- support players with elements to contest, in different types of conflicts<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>The list is extensive, covering every facet of leadership in role-playing games. Some of the techniques are well know, but when used in a method, combined with other techniques, some of them bring new effects to the game. Some of the techniques are brand new, and hilarious in their effect on game-play ("the impressionist method", for one, made use of high speed and sudden shifts in scene-setting, that left leaders and players alike breathless, and positively befuddled over what was happening to them). The point has always been, for me as a designer and organizer of role-playing games, to give my leaders hands on advice to follow, towards game-play of excellent nature. <br/><br/>And my assistant leaders have been invaluable, both in discussions on techniques, in testing, and in ground-breaking tournament play at conventions (mostly the annual <i>Arcon</i> game convention, here in Oslo). We have stumbled and groped about a lot, in darkness and in bewilderment over new landscapes, but mostly we have been granted some kind of success in our explorative work. And sometimes our successes have been extraordinary, for both leaders and players. Most important of all; along the way this stubborn and tireless exploration of techniques have furnished us with great tools of play.<br/><br/>I need to write more detailed on this, and will do, in my new version of the classical role-playing game that has been my main vehicle of exploration; the fantasy rpg <i>Fabula</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368364/#Comment_368364" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T15:09:21+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  3:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2012 3:15PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Remember not all minds are the same.</blockquote>They are, basically.Tomas, I think you missed Mendel's point.  He was specifically responding to your assertion that "It is easier to go into interactive flow with 'softer' methods."  He said that, for him, it is <i>not</i> easier.  I think we can take him at his word.  <br/><br/>I personally find that it is easier for <i>me</i> to go into interactive flow with softer methods, but I have played with people for whom that was definitely <i>not</i> the case.  As GM, I once tried to describe a cliff.  The players wanted to know how difficult it was to climb.  I thought I did a very good job providing a visual description, and relating that to the tasks the characters would have to perform.  And yet both players claimed that the fiction was less clear in their minds than it became when they were told "you need a 7 or higher on 2d6".  I believe this difference reflects that we experience life in different ways, with quantification being more integral for some people than for others.<br/><br/>Of course there are universal human truths, and I agree that we should mine those for effective game procedures, but "softer methods = better flow" is not one of them.  (Unless Mendel and I both misunderstood what you meant by "softer".)<br/><br/>I think your point about automated responses is a good one, and a discussion of how to tap into those is very exciting!  Perhaps that's what you've been doing all along?

I reckon that his conviction mirrors his experiences.<br/><br/>Still; I have experienced that stubborn "this is not my cup of tea"-players have changed opinion in droves, when subjected to effective dialogue-techniques in actual game-play. It may be due to the fact that there is nothing "soft" in being led effectively into tense, heated, teeth-gnashing or tear-dripping interaction, and being empowered as a player, by the method, to play a meaningful role such interaction.

The one game I've used as a vehicle for exploration in this field, is the game <i>Fabula</i>, a classical frp-game with resolution mechanics based on the D20, with skills and bonuses for diverse elements, with XP, and geared towards campaign-play. In <i>Fabula</i>; when you character is challenged; roll and add the numbers, and see how far the die brings you in a crisis. Very much like any other classical game, on the surface, and with <i>mechanics</i>. But with effective <i>techniques</i> too, to help interaction to new heights.<br/><br/>So I am talking about methods with techniques AND mechanics here, mostly. There are methods without mechanics too, but for the sake of discussion; lets keep to the classical set-up; leader + players, and methods with techniques AND mechanics.<br/><br/>And now; let me at least try to disclose some of the things you don't see ...<br/><br/>Player empowerment in <b>player-to-player</b> interaction:<br/>- the right to frame scenes, and simple advice on how to do it<br/>- the right to put other characters into your scenes<br/>- the right to narrate consequences on higher skill-levels<br/>- open access to and use of central setting-elements<br/><br/>Player empowerment in <b>player-to-character</b> interaction:<br/>- more support on and better contact with emotional content<br/>- greater imaginative space in mechanical procedures<br/>- clearer venues of character-play<br/>- power to evoke personal relationships<br/><br/>I hope this helps inspire some understanding of how players may be empowered, in methods with different balances between techniques and mechanics. When a designer is conscious of the two main "tool-boxes" in a method; <i>techniques</i> and <i>mechanics</i>, he is more able to work the balance between them, choosing game tools from both, as needed, to meet the challenges presented in his vision of "The Game", and to design a game of greater effectivity and impact, in the hands of his players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368501/#Comment_368501" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T13:02:00+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  1:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

I agree that such techniques are extremely important, and that integrating them with mechanics is important for the overall shape of play.  That shouldn't be a controversial notion around here!  It's the foundation that many favorites, like <i>Polaris</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, are built on.<br/><br/>These techniques seem to be of a different sort than the play techniques you listed earlier, about touching and listening and closing eyes.

To make a game with the dynamic qualities that supports a broader theme, as in a classical fantasy rpg, we have to work a variety of tools. I'm not trying to present an extensive list of tools here, just examples to make things clearer.<br/><br/>And yes; the player-to-character list is important, and a field I really love to work in. You are right too, in the observation that I'm a bit more vague in that list. Let me try to be more precise on the first point ...<br/><br/><b>More support on and better contact with emotional content:</b><br/>- observing players from first handshake and throughout the game<br/>- challenging characters in relationships, enticing them, working possible tensions<br/>- playing opposing interests, creating moral dilemmas for the characters<br/>- disclosing possible emotional reactions, and helping players in portraying them<br/>- placing instinctive auto-responces on character (fear, anger, lust), for player to deal with<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>Most of this is known to experienced leaders/designers of rpgs. The new thing here (to most) is the way it is combined in a larger method, to make each tool work in unison with others, to greater effect. The full force of this empowers the players in relation to their characters; they get a more nuanced view of the psychosocial nature of their characters, and have more venues of exploration, giving them choices in interpretation that seldom surface in other games. Ordinary players become great players when supported in this way. Seeing an ordinary player impressing his peers with superb character-play, and inspiring them to the same quality in interpretation, is really something. I love the flow of game-play that ensues from such engagement!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368529/#Comment_368529" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T15:35:11+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  3:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- disclosing possible emotional reactions, and helping players in portraying them</blockquote>Very interesting!

What do you do?<br/>P1: Huh.  Um...<br/>GM: On the one hand, the slander is a big deal; it's unjust, and cruel.  Does it make you angry?  Do you feel a thirst for justice?  Does it make you feel awful to know what others now think of you?<br/>P1: Yeah!  The anger is not a big deal, but I cannot stand the affront to my honor!<br/>GM: On the other hand, your daughter is scared!  You're her father!  How do you feel about leaving her here to dread your death?  Are you afraid, ashamed, or unwilling to bring that kind of pain to the person you love?<br/>P1: I can steel myself against her tears; I know this is best for her.<br/>GM: Okay, great, so what do you do?<br/>P1: I go fight the monster.<br/>GM: But wait!  Not yet!  Right now, your daughter is begging you not to go.  You can steel yourself, and you cannot stand the affront to your honor.  Let us all see that!<br/>P1: Um...  I tell her not to cry.  Then I go get my sword.<br/>GM: Perhaps you could express why your honor is so important?  Perhaps, when you tell her not to cry, you could say why this must be done?  When you steel yourself, do you simply leave, or do you try to calm her at all?  Is there anyone you tell of your quest for justice?<br/>P1: Yeah, I'll explain it to her.<br/>GM: Great!  Show us!  "Daddy," she says, "please don't go!"  What do you say?<br/><br/>Does that sound about right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_368564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368564/#Comment_368564" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T22:37:21+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 10:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2012 3:11AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ja, it sounds about right. <br/><br/>For myself I would prefer to stay more in character with the daughter, though, and try to work the conflict through character-dialogue. And I would try to avoid stalling so much; "On the other hand" and "But wait". Too much stalling and the player feels overrun, not empowered. So; stay in character, make use of hints, and limit your eagerness to shed light on every facet. Go with the flow of dialogue. <br/><br/>Hinting on emotional reactions and/or moral implications through dialogue is fun! In the particular situation from your example it could start up like this:<br/><i>- Daddy; that beast is not threatening the family; it is only murdering peasants! There's no honor in fighting for peasants!</i><br/>- (the players father/baron-figure possibly saying he has to; the peasants being his responsibility)<br/><i>- No! That is unfair! You are MY daddy, and should keep ME safe! Peasants are dumb! You should not die for them!</i><br/>- (player possibly trying to calm unruly and spoilt daughter, or admonishing her)<br/>- (me following up on his lead, with willful twists)<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>I see the leader being a willful teenager here, as supportive of the players interpretation of his character;<br/>-  it helps the player play up on the moral obligation of his character towards his people<br/>- it helps the player dive into his role as a father to this willful child<br/>- and it implies that he is in trouble raising his child; she is willful and brutally arrogant<br/><br/>Working multiple layers like this helps the player explore his character, as well as making choices hard, and occasionally; very emotional. <br/><br/>Working family and friends of the character is fundamental to this kind of game-play; that is where the great treasures are to be found. Our personalities are forged in relationships in real life, and that is the best way to do it in role-playing games too. And playing fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, releases tons of underlying "emotives" in normal players. These figures are full of tension and symbolic meaning to most people, and tapping into that intensifies our interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_369106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369106/#Comment_369106" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-24T16:55:00+00:00" title="March 24, 2012  4:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>A "Mechanic" in Australian English, is a person who manipulates a "Mechanism", they often do so by following a specific "Methodology".</blockquote>So you are saying that I am right, when placing <i>mechanics</i> within the larger term of <i>method</i>! <br/>- Method is what we do.<br/>- Mechanics (and techniques) are what we use. <br/>Good!<br/><br/>I love the way this debate springs into fruit these days.

Do it with a simple word of welcome, and make sure you do it with all players. Do the same at the end of a session; shake hands with them, giving thanks for the game. This is a positive way of framing the game; establishing direct contact and trust between the leader and the individual player.<br/><br/>If the players follow up on this by shaking hands amongst themselves too, it is a boon to the game.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369192/#Comment_369192" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T02:11:09+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  2:11AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2012 2:19AM by Upstart.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: Just read your last post, which actually rendered this post moot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_369193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369193/#Comment_369193" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T02:27:12+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  2:27AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2012 2:29AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problems of "moot posts" are well known to experienced forum-posters.
