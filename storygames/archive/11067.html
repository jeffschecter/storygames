What purpose do they serve?<br/><br/>I get the impression that flashbacks - in the sense of saying "Let's do a flashback to..." - are usually descriptive. They flesh out a character or situation. Are there exceptions? Can they take the action forward?<br/><br/>Also, they often seem to have a meditative quality. They're a breather, a respite from the action. Are there exceptions to that? <br/><br/>(Two special cases here. I understand that it's possible to flash back to a very <i>active</i> scene, such as a duel, but I think that's still essentially descriptive. It says 'This character is a fighty person'. Such scenes also feel like a 'breather': even though they're active, they feel like a pause in the action. I also understand it's possible to move the timeline of the game back: let's play out some scenes from earlier that day. That's not a real flashback, in my head. It's just shifting the timeline.)<br/><br/>Do you use flashbacks a lot? Do you like them? Are they a useful technique in practice or just in theory?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245477/#Comment_245477" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T07:03:55+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  7:03AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played out flashbacks, rather than just described them.

I think most people just don't think about them. <br/><br/>When a person describes an action it can be at any point in time. The referee who sets the to happen roll decides whither is really has a chance. If they don't like the temperal disturbance they can give it a really unlikely chance. Flashbacks change the matrix of the game is subtle ways. They explain why something happened in a cool twisted way. Flashforwards can predict(mandate) who lives. This can be cool.<br/><br/>What I wonder about is why so few people think outside of the box and do these kinds of things? Are we really that limited to action only being linear?

And since everyone in the thread is all casual and "oh flashbacks lol we do that yep" I'm sure EVERYONE CAN SOLVE IT EASY.  *hands on hips*<br/><br/>Okay, so ever since the end of Season 1, I've been working on a LOST-a-like game.  If you haven't watched Lost, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/lost" rel="nofollow">go watch Season 1</a>, which is one of the best seasons on TV, and the pilot is one of the best pilots ever to be on TV, and the first fifteen minutes of the pilot is one of the best first fifteen minutes of a pilot ever to be on TV.<br/><br/>Basically the structure of the show is this:<br/><br/>A bunch of strangers crash on a remote jungle island in the South Pacific. They have to survive, face the possibility of rescue (or not) and get caught up in all kinds of strange mysteries.  But what makes the show special is that there's this big jumble of characters whose identities are all at stake.  After this wreck, who they are is in enormous crisis.  Some have strong motivations to change who they are or who they appear to be.  Virtually everyone lies about who they were before the plane crash to some degree - after all, they can remake themselves, these strangers don't know anything about them.<br/><br/>But the audience learns about them because in every episode there's a semi-parallel flashback story (the writers from day one said that the flashbacks "weren't really flashbacks" and they eventually are right but from a storytelling perspective, they're flashbacks) that bring out aspects of the characters in their pre-Island life that are now informing the events that are happening in real time.<br/><br/>These aren't just "hay a scene, looks like he's lying about that lol", they're fully developed stories on their own, mini-stories, almost, with characters, desires, motivations, obstacles and resolutions.<br/><br/>This creates a really great excitement for the audience. We get to see the tension between who they were and who they are. It's revealed to us through the events on the island and the mini-plots in the flashbacks<br/><br/>Now here's my flashback problem.<br/><br/>Let's say I do this.  I was aiming for an apocalypse game. Zombies, The Bomb, whatever. The characters are flung together into a situation - they bond over the situation like people in that situation do. They are put under pressure because of this situation. But something else is going on that the other characters don't know about.  We have a miniplot - one or maybe just one-half of a session in which one character's past is revealed through a segment of play.  I pass out the character sheets for NPCs to other players, along with some idea of their motivations and goals, and we play out the flashback.<br/><br/>But does this really work?<br/><br/>- I'm not guaranteed any decent tension between who the PC is in the flashback and who they are in the present day.  Maybe all the flashback reveals is they haven't changed.  Is that cool?  Is there some way of making that cool, maybe by messing with the outcome of the flashback depending on PC decisions?<br/><br/>- The player of the PC will not really get the dramatic benefit of the flashback because they "already know" the PC.  The other players are the ones that will be going "oh wow, so THAT is why that guy is doing this".  Is this a good thing or a bad thing? It seems counterintuitive that a scene/chapter that's focused on a PC would not actually be as dramatically satisfying for that player as it would be for the others...is that true, or a good or bad thing if it is true?<br/><br/>- Is there a better way to handle LOST-a-like flashbacks, or to get that sense of character revelation through brief but detailed situations?<br/><br/>Okay, there, now fix my wagon, I mean problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245838/#Comment_245838" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T16:51:14+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  4:51PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I'm not guaranteed any decent tension between who the PC is in the flashback and who they are in the present day.

Then staying the same might seem strange.

I would think landing the thematic parallel would be a lot harder than getting a good pair of character-focused scenes, since identifying what a game (or game session, in this case) is "really about" is not easy to do.<br/><br/>So I would think that yes, it's cool if the flashback PC is pretty much on the same page with the present-day PC, provided that the situations in front of that PC (in both the flashback and the present) are compelling, and the players are having a good time engaging with them.\n<blockquote>- The player of the PC will not really get the dramatic benefit of the flashback because they "already know" the PC.  The other players are the ones that will be going "oh wow, so THAT is why that guy is doing this".  Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

For one, they get to play their character in two cool scenes where their choices really count for something.  That's good stuff, right there.  Then there's the spotlight being firmly on their PC and their PC's issues, which is another seriously good thing.  And if that wasn't enough, they get the satisfaction of revealing to the other players why their PC is acting this way, which obviously is fun enough that you want a piece of it as the GM.  (So maybe the question should be whether you're willing to share the dramatic satisfaction of revealing why a PC does the things he does with the PC's player?  Will it diminish <i>your</i> fun if the player's the one who pulls the trigger on the revelation and gets to see the "oh WOW" look from everyone else? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>)<br/><br/><br/>As an aside, is this game idea for your group that doesn't like in media res scenes?  Because I'd think that the on-the-spot nature of those flashback scenes is either going to call for players who can work in media res, or it'll need a lot of pre-planning.  Either they've got to have solid character histories going in, or they've got to be able to quickly build one in the flashback, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245842/#Comment_245842" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T18:05:07+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  6:05PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wraith/Orpheus use "harrowings" to good effect. In Orpheus, harrowings are specific flashback scenes that present the character with a very familiar situation. Fighter gets attacked by orcs, Rogue is in a trapped dungeon, etc. The catch with harrowings is that you can't get out of the scene by doing whatever you would normally do. The orcs just keep getting up and the traps just spring regardless. It's not until the Fighter runs or the Rogue decides whatever's in the dungeon isn't worth the trouble that they are released from the scene. The point of a harrowing is to encourage thinking-outside-the-box which has a meta-game as well as in-fiction basis. Harrowings are similar in Wraith, but are more personal scenes that force characters to re-evaluate their priorities.<br/><br/>Also, <a href="http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B7S8NOzUyFzaODNlMDQ3ZTgtYTZhYS00YjA0LTg4MjMtNTVmNDZkYWY2Yjgx&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">my own 24 Hour RPG entry</a> is all about flashbacks.

I can't believe that I forgot about <i>Showdown</i>, but this is one of the things it does 100% right. Half of the scenes in <i>Showdown</i> are flashbacks. They work like this:<br/><br/>When you make your character, you write four "qualities", four elements of your character's self-image, in the form "I think that I am X" for predicates X, like "I think that I am a tough guy." During each flashback, the (usually) one winning player will have the opportunity to change one of his opponent's qualities by adding "...but actually, I am Y", like "I think that I am a tough guy, but actually I'm willing to utterly debase myself to avoid pain." The losing player (usually) then narrates the flashback scene in a way that reveals that weakness, almost always showing how the winner was responsible for shredding that portion of his self-image.  This is awesome.<br/><br/>The rules dictate that the flashbacks are themselves in chronological order, which allows us to make sense of not knowing that one character really is a spineless wimp and not a tough guy when we do flashback 1, because that happened before he came to realize his weakness in flashback 2, which took place later.<br/><br/>Seriously, check <i>Showdown</i> out. There's an unfinished PbP playtest <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8445" rel="nofollow">here</a> which gives a good sense of how it works, and work it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245886/#Comment_245886" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T04:21:35+00:00" title="December  9, 2009  4:21AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>Do you use flashbacks a lot?

It means that the player doesn't get to show people cool things about his character that they didn't know before, and in fact it means someone else at the table gets to write horrible things about his character that, for all we know, might make them go "welp, thanks for inviting me to the game, call me if I ever get to play my guy again".<br/><br/>However, what is awesome is the REVERSE of this.  Where, in the "present day" scenes, the other players decide on a trait for a character: "Bob is a tough guy."  Then in the flashback, the player of Bob shows another facet to that, a "but" that might take back some of the toughness, or might show where his toughness got him in trouble, or where the toughness came from.  That way we get the thrill of discovery, the growth of tension AND we don't make Bob's player hate playing Bob so much they could spit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245959/#Comment_245959" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T11:34:18+00:00" title="December  9, 2009 11:34AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: JDCorleyI - Is there a better way to handle LOST-a-like flashbacks, or to get that sense of character revelation through brief but detailed situations?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, there, now fix my wagon, I mean problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did actually run a Lost-a-like a couple of years ago and the flashbacks worked fine; every week, I would ask one of the players to nominate themselves to have a flashback story for their character, which would run in parallel to the island-based plot of that episode. I also used a parallel rule set for the flashbacks: instead of statting out NPCs, I just handed the other players a pool of dice, which they had to split over the three scenes the flashback played out in. At the end of each flashback scene, the PC faced a conflict: if they won, they got a positive experience point and if they lost, they got a negative experience point; they got to spend +ve points on skills and advantages but had to soak -ve points by reducing skills or taking drawbacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this way, we found out that one PC was working for a secret society that wanted to restrict access to the island and that another PC had a strange artifact that was bequeathed to her by her father who had worked on the island in the 1970s. Also, after each player had had two or three turns at doing their own flashbacks, I then opened it up and we did flashbacks for some iof the interestinf NPCs (I had a plot device within the story to explain why the PCs became aware of these things, despite nobodt telling them about them: don't ask, it involved a psychic and a pet chihauhau...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole campaign lasted about 20 sessions and the flashbacks were very rewarding, they frequently turned even my preconceptions of what was going on on their head and the XP rewards were a good incentive for the players to really throw themselves into the action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince" title="Irishvince"><img alt="Irishvince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/464/n77MQHB4WLBHG.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince">Irishvince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245961/#Comment_245961" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T11:49:56+00:00" title="December  9, 2009 11:49AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2009 11:50AM by Irishvince.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>- Is there a better way to handle LOST-a-like flashbacks, or to get that sense of character revelation through brief but detailed situations?<br/></blockquote>\nI'm working on a Game (called <i>Unraveled</i>) that will use this (LOST-a-like flashbacks) as a main mechanic.

Results of 6 explode and if you have a skill, you get to add that to your best result.<br/>\n<br/>\n - I think the pool of dice I handed out in a flashback was 10 dice and everyone knew in advance there would be three conflicts; in each flashback, one player would take on the role of their PC (or later on, an NPC) while another player would act out the opposition in each scene and I would add in suggestions to keep the story-arc on track.<br/>\n<br/>\n - The player taking on the role of the opposition in the flashback would have the final say in what arena the conflict in each scene was played out in, so they could steer it to the flashbacking-PC's/NPC's strengths or weaknesses as they chose.<br/>\n<br/>\n - When it came time for the conflict, the opposing player would decide how many of the pool dice to commit before any rolls were made, so they could go the whole hog and really beat down the PC, but they would be drained fo dice for the remaining scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was totally up to the opposing player to justify the strength of the opposition they threw at the PC, sort of like the dice-weighting mechanic in Hot War, and the end of each scene in a flashback would suggest where to go in the next part of it; the third scene would be the one in which we learned something erally major about the character, at which point the player would have +ve and/or -ve XP to spend on character development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275204/#Comment_275204" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T13:58:50+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  1:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>JD<br/><br/>We talk about flashbacks and think "Oh this is in the past" but as later years of LOST show - past, future, it's all the same.
