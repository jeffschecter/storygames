Are you making this game for avid comic readers or people who've only ever seen a superhero movie or two? The second thing to consider is the focus of the experience you're trying to provide. Is it fine if they meander through superheroland aimlessly, enjoying the scenery? Or do you want them to have a specific experience that's like pages out of a certain kind/era/writer's type of comic?<br/><br/>Once you have your design scope nailed down, you can think about how to bring this about: which parts to promote, provoke, provide, or prevent.

It's the philosophy I work by. <br/><br/>When I was taking art classes, one of the rules they pounded into my head is, "Form follows function". On organic things, every piece (muscle, bone, etc) that makes it up generally has a particular function. You can also apply this to machines. Every part in a machine (well, a good machine) is there for a particular reason, and helps the entire thing do what it's supposed to do. Everything interacts, and is all relevant.<br/><br/>In stories (or RPGs) your Form takes shape in the way of rules, setting, characters, etc. The Function of the game can be somewhat likened (in my head at least) to the Concept and Setting of your game. In other words, what is it that your game is trying to achieve with it's Form? So the question: When to stop?<br/><br/>I try to look at concept and setting first and foremost. Then I try to go back to it as much as possible. Everything I write should relate, somehow, back to those. In my current project, I found myself in the same predicament, and I thought back to 'form follows function'. Everything I've written after that point loops back to something else that's of importance. Even characters that would seem (to players) to be of minor importance have a meaning that bolsters the concept and setting. Some things were removed or changed to help come back to the original concept as well.<br/><br/>Once you have enough Form to support your Function (remembering to keep things tight and relevant), your concept should be able to stand on it's own legs. Everything else is icing on the carefully-prepared cake you've created. As long as what your writing adds to the narrative in a way that's relevant to the players, I say absolutely add it. <br/><br/>If not, you can always use it for fiction based on your game! (This is my plan for all of the extra stuff I write/think about that just doesn't seem to be appropriate for the game text)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438335/#Comment_438335" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-14T10:03:07+00:00" title="September 14, 2014 10:03AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much depends on whether you intend a print release or an elecrtonic one, and if the latter, are you using the (crummy, bad) PDF standard or some other (good, helpful) standard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paradoxinversion" title="paradoxinversion"><img alt="paradoxinversion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paradoxinversion">paradoxinversion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438338/#Comment_438338" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-14T11:36:38+00:00" title="September 14, 2014 11:36AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I ask what's wrong with PDF?
