One of the best possible side-effects happened as a result of all the hullaballoo  from before --  got an idea for a Spirit of the Century supplement.  He pitched it to me this week, and what can I say?  It's <b>Bruce Baugh.</b>  The contracts are in the process of getting inked, we've got a plan, and now, we have an announcement.<br/><br/><a href="http://bruceb.livejournal.com/240455.html" rel="nofollow">Bruce has already mentioned it over on his LiveJournal</a>, and I have <a href="http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/245561.html" rel="nofollow">an announcement</a> up as well.  But here's a copy for Story Games, because I think some of you might think it's neat:\n<blockquote><i>She is the strongest human being alive, her muscles super-charged by her own scientific processes. She\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fought dinosaurs barehanded and lived to tell the tale. But she can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t join any professional society for engineers, or even hold the patents for her inventions in her own name. <br/><br/>He is a supernaturally good poet. He can smell truth and lies from across the street. He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s saved the life of one president, two prime ministers, and a future pope. But if he goes out for a gourmet meal with friends, managers will insist he go in through the servants\xe2\u20ac\u2122 entrance. <br/><br/>Two men share a mystical union, pooling their health, knowledge, and magical essence. They bind demons and champion the falsely accused in courts on three continents. But if they ever once acknowledge the love they share along with their power, they\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be disbarred and shunned by decent people everywhere. <br/><br/>The band of five fought in two wars for liberty, first against invading armies and then against tyrants at home. They free serfs, fight the architects of murder, and have twice stopped mad schemes of genocide. But they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re communists, and can't even get visas to visit other heroes and scholars in the US. <br/><br/>Brother and sister are heirs to a millennia-old family tradition of serving justice and knowledge. Their ancestors commanded armies, delved into ancient tombs to lay ghosts\xe2\u20ac\u201dand worse things\xe2\u20ac\u201dto rest, taught the founders of new schools of philosophy and military strategy. But in the New World, he's barely tolerated as a ditch digger\xe2\u20ac\u201dand she'll be deported if she teaches English to other immigrants.<br/><br/>These are the <b>other</b> heroes, the ones who must fight for their dignity and liberty just as fiercely as they take on the challenges all pulp heroes face.</i><br/><br/><b><i>New Horizons</i></b> is a new supplement for <b><i><a href="http://www.evilhat.com/?spirit" rel="nofollow">Spirit of the Century</a></i></b>. Each chapter addresses a marginalized group from the pulps, kept outside by their sex, their race, their lifestyle, or their beliefs.  In <b><i>New Horizons</i></b> you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll find information about real-life heroic individuals and teams, the challenges they face and some of the solutions they find to the problems of dealing with 1920s society.  You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll also find heroes and villains ready for use, plot hooks, and ties to the mysteries around the Century Club.  The life of heroes outside the mainstream may seem as strange as the secret language of Atlantis, but can be as exciting and powerful in play as a zeppelin armada. <br/><br/><b><i>New Horizons</i></b> comes to you from veteran author and developer Bruce Baugh in collaboration with the minds behind <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/" rel="nofollow">Evil Hat Productions</a>.  We aim to show some of the real failings of the pulp era when it comes to fairness and justice in order to provide rich and vibrant new possibilities for adventure roleplaying in a bygone era.  The real world is full of surprises\xe2\u20ac\u201ddense, weird, and just plain cool\xe2\u20ac\u201dand the bright light of <b><i>Spirit</i></b>\xe2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic pulp heroism can shine on some difficult realities just where they need it most.<br/> <br/><b><i>New Horizons</i></b> is about adding <i>truth</i> without sacrificing <i>adventure</i>\xe2\u20ac\u201dabout bringing the <i>real world</i> together with the <i>fantastic</i>.  Change your game.  <i>Change the world</i>.</blockquote>\nWe're looking at getting Brand Robins to do the editing as well (his hand has already been at work in the above).  This idea's maybe a couple of days old, so Bruce isn't yet onto the actual writing yet -- but you can expect to see him talking about it occasionally over on his journal.<br/><br/><i>I'm pretty damned excited.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58591/#Comment_58591" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T17:10:51+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  5:10PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude.

Depends on how good you are at research, how good you are at putting it together, generating ideas for it, and then weaving it into the setting and system. This isn't just a book about historical conditions, its a book full of NPCs, plot ideas, and ways to make historical conditions into a game. If you're as good as Bruce at that, then sure, you could probably write this book yourself.  Of course, even then you wouldn't get the insight that Bruce will bring to the task, you'd only have your own. <br/><br/>But more importantly, if you did it yourself you wouldn't have me to edit it and tell you where you are wrong. Bruce now gets to deal not just with research and making a game cool, but making it cool enough that I don't slap him and say mean things to him that make him cry. <br/><br/>As for me, I'm totally jazzed about this for ever so many reasons. That I'm part of it is, obviously, one of those. But I also love the fact that it grew directly out of fan responses. People wanted something like this, they asked for something like this, they voice concerns about the default tone of Spirit, and Evil Hat listened. I love the fact that its going to be full of nifty game coolness, with new villains and new heroes and a renewed sense that the world is full of zany, wonderful, terrible stuff without having to always go gonzo. I mean, I think its fun that we often go back to the Gorilla Kahn aspect of pulps, but I sometimes think we miss out on the fact that lots of the old pulps were really into issues of history and the world in ways we often overlook now. I mean sure, they had lost Atlantis (though that wasn't the pop culture term it is now until someone went out, researched, and started writing stories about it) -- but they also had the Orient Express, and the Mexican Revolution, and a lot of other things that when we cast our eyes out we totally overlook. (I mean, I know its odd to think of now, but there was a time when the Nazis were the ruling government of a country that the US was not at war with in which the pulps were using them as bad-guys anyway. Nowdays we think "nazi bash" as good clean fun with no political side -- but it was once a very political issue to punch Hitler in the mouth.) Sure there is gonzo, but there is also reality and a sense of wonder (and terror) in the real world that modern pulp often lacks. <br/><br/>I'm really thinking this book has a chance to bring some of that back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58720/#Comment_58720" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T09:56:56+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  9:56AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2007 9:57AM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, comments like this one from Bruce make me happy: \n<blockquote>I think that a lot of gamers never learned how to use history (and other scholarship) to best effect, and in part New Horizons should be a "show by example" book. I've never had so much opportunity to talk directly to players and GMs about the methodology along with the stats and all, and intend to make the most of it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Different people do different things and have wildly different experiences all against the same background, and deciding how you want to select the specific circumstances to use in play - the overall tone of the campaign, what works for this scene, and in between - can be (should be, I'd say) both challenging and fun.<br/><br/>I was just remarking to Fred, in fact, that I'd like to do something like this: take a particular moment where someone in one of the groups I'm covering has an interesting encountering with the powers that be, and show how very differently it can be described by observers and scholars all of whom are honest and have good will, but who are all bringing different perspectives to bear. "Anything goes" and "it can only be this one way" are both common errors in using history in entertainment, but fortunately, the middle ground is both available and very often more enjoyable once you see how to get there.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58780/#Comment_58780" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T13:04:06+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  1:04PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Brand.
