I have restarted my podcast, I need games to talk about.  Please pitch awesome stuff on Lulu, new or old, which I should totally get for my collection.<br/><br/>Myself, I have published a couple of games there:<br/><br/><b>The Daughters of Verona</b> is a Shakespearean comedy game.  It was sold out, but with this crafts project edition you can assemble your own lovely copy, without having access to a color printer. <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/the-daughters-of-verona/paperback/product-23193558.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/the-daughters-of-verona/paperback/product-23193558.html</a><br/><br/><b>While the World Ends</b> was illustrated by Claudia Cangini earlier this year following a crowdfunding.  It has never been this pretty before. <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/while-the-world-ends/paperback/product-23102594.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/while-the-world-ends/paperback/product-23102594.html</a><br/><br/><b>OKULT</b> is a small booklet which describes a horror game of great scope, set in your own hometown. Investigate a mystery as a returning adult, a mystery that evokes memories of things repressed that happened in high school. <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/okult/paperback/product-21356612.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/okult/paperback/product-21356612.html</a><br/><br/><b>The Academy</b> is a game about youths at a boarding school.  Play Harry Potter, play Ender's Game, play Tom Brown's School Days, play whatever, as long as it happens at a boarding school. :-)  <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/the-academy/paperback/product-23105599.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/the-academy/paperback/product-23105599.html</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
