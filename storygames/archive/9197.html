I know there's a glut of these\u2026<br/><br/><b>Red Rock</b><br/>Red Rock lies between one and two weeks south of Bridal Falls. An exclusive settlement of faithful, it spans over ten square miles of dry, harsh land. When the dogs arrive, it is fall and the harvest is coming in\u2026 shy of expectations.<br/><br/>SOMETHING\u2019S WRONG<br/>Seven or eight months ago, Steward Peter passed on. His son, Seth, was expected to take over the position, but quickly the townsfolk determined they could govern themselves without a steward. Without a steward, the church was locked up, and the people expected to \u201cmanage\u201d their families according to the word. Brothers Jackson and Levi rose to the highest ranks of the town, openly displaying their strength. Brother Seth (expecting to be steward) has been cuckolded by Jackson. Sister Ruth holds private readings of the book of life with women in the community.<br/><br/>PRIDE<br/>The people believe themselves capable of self-control and governance, rejecting the notion of a steward. Seth believed himself the \u201cnext in line,\u201d with or without the sanction of Bridal Falls. Sister Ruth now reads to some of the women who need direction in households devoid of faithful leadership.<br/><br/>INJUSTICE<br/>The weak are generally ignored. The elderly have nothing to offer, spending their days sitting in vacant wonder at the conditions of the settlement. Seth\u2019s wife has left him for Jackson. Seth, without children, works tirelessly to provide for himself. The townsfolk generally disrespect him (some children openly throw rotten fruit at him when he pulls his cart through town).<br/><br/>SINS<br/>General pride and selfishness \u2014 no one specific sin stands out as a great transgression<br/>Laziness \u2014 some children do not work and most elderly are expected to step aside<br/>Temptation \u2014 some have started playing games like checkers during working hours and others imbibe coffee<br/><br/>DEMONIC ATTACKS<br/>The demons have subtlety planted the seeds of discord through prideful action. Seth\u2019s quick ascension to steward was firmly rejected by stronger members of the flock, fomenting a healthy dose of ego into some settlement members.<br/><br/>FALSE DOCTRINE<br/>We can govern ourselves. We are righteous and divine. No sin shall deter us from our faith.<br/><br/>\u201cIron sharpens iron.\u201d Only the strong deserve to be considered divine in the eyes of the King of Life.<br/><br/>CORRUPT WORSHIP<br/>Sister Ruth reads with some of the women. In addition, Jackson and Levi carry weapons openly in the streets as a demonstration of their \u201calpha\u201d status. The two consider strength a virtue and equate bullish behavior with strength.<br/><br/>FALSE PRIESTHOOD<br/>There is no priesthood any longer, as such, everyone has strayed from the path, even those who continue to live justly.<br/><br/>SORCERY<br/>In the face of the \u201cmight makes right\u201d ideals of Jackson and Levi, mediocrity has taken ahold of the settlement. Those who have what they need, grow content, and overlook those in need.<br/><br/>HATE AND MURDER<br/>Children openly mock Seth and Jackson makes sure to put Seth in his place whenever possible. Humiliation and contempt are the order of the day. Many people see that Seth is nothing more than a cuckold now and few have sympathy for what has happened to him. If something isn\u2019t done, Seth will either be killed or he will hang himself out of desperation.<br/><br/>WHAT DO THE TOWNSPEOPLE WANT FROM THE DOGS?<br/>The people want a fair appointment of a steward. If possible, the punishment of those have turned so far from the faith.<br/><br/>WHAT DO THE DEMONS WANT?<br/>The demons want the people of Red Rock to fall further and further from the teachings, every so slowly\u2026 so that none notice their complete disregard for one another.<br/><br/>WHAT DO THE DEMONS WANT THE DOGS TO DO?<br/>The demons want the dogs to place Seth in charge of the settlement. In a few months time, he will be dead or infirm and things will return to normal.<br/><br/>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DOGS DIDN\u2019T COME?<br/>Eventually Seth would die \u2014 either through suicide or murder. Gluttony and slovenliness would overcome the town. In another year, it would hardly recognize a settlement of the faithful.<br/><br/>KNOWN ISSUES<br/>Brother Jackson is the true leader of the community. He walks with a natural swagger and openly displays a pistol in his belt. He is a natural for the position, with Brother Levi acting as his second. Levi is less natural in the role of a leader and mimics much of Jackson\u2019s behavior.<br/><br/>Brother Jackson \u2014 who already has two wives \u2014 has taken on Seth\u2019s ex-wife into his home. While they are not officially married, enough townsfolk have turned a blind eye as for it to not matter.<br/><br/>Brother Levi treats his wife like property, sometimes going as far as slapping her in front of others (although this is rare).<br/><br/>Sister Ruth holds private vigils in her home. People know of this, but convince themselves that it\u2019s not happening.<br/><br/>Seth is openly disrespected by over half the congregation.<br/><br/>Adah visits with Sister Ruth for readings and is considered her most trusted \u201cstudent.\u201d Her husband (Bartlby) is blissfully unaware that there is anything amiss in the town at all.<br/><br/>Brother Issac and Sister Mary (and their two children) stand as two of the beacons in the community. They have not been taken in by any of the malingering or false worship. Sadly, they have done little to stop it, either. Issac sees an obligation to his family first and the community second.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203563/#Comment_203563" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T16:22:26+00:00" title="April 25, 2009  4:22PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

I think your town goes directly at the 900 pound gorilla in Dogs, i.e. Maybe everyone would be better off if there were no Faith and no Dogs telling everyone what to do. And at least in this town things don't seem to be all that rosy once you've kicked the Faith out. I'm not surprised that the PCs are perplexed as the Town's sin ladder hasn't gone to anything near murder, so there's a lot of room for interpretations on all sides.<br/>I do have a couple of questions: You refer to Seth's wife as an "ex" wife. Does the Faith see it that way? I mean, was the marriage annulled by a Steward or a Dog? Also, how is Jackson handling having the new Dogs in town telling him what to do (or potentially telling him what to do)? Lastly, do you know what each of the NPCs wants from the Dogs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203581/#Comment_203581" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-26T02:10:10+00:00" title="April 26, 2009  2:10AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth's wife has left him and since everyone is afraid to say anything to Seth\u2026 it got approved by inaction.<br/><br/>Right now, the dogs aren't playing their hand with Jackson... he's made it clear with his swagger not to "screw with him" but the PCs are bidding their time.<br/><br/>Most NPCs want the dogs to just keep on going. But those suffering injustice want SOMEONE appointed steward. And of course, I can continue inventing LITTLE things for the dogs to do, but I think malaise is among the hardest problems for a PC to solve in any RPG, let alone DOGS.<br/><br/>And yes\u2026 i chose this plot for a very clear reason\u2026 what if the sin was so small, it hardly even registered. Being rude, really isn't a sin any religion\u2026 it's just jerkiness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
