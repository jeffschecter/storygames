Refering to my contest game, <i>Out There</i>, I asked, "So, you're not thrilled by more investigation games, huh?  Are there plenty of good ones already?"<br/><br/>He responded, "That's what you do in <i>every</i> game.  That and fighting."<br/><br/>Huh.  Well, I guess that's true, as, "find out what's next!" is investigation of a sort.  For me, though, when I get pumped about "investigation", I'm thinking puzzle-solving.  Not just seeing pieces that clearly add up, but seeing pieces and doing some challenging mental work to add them up and find The Right Answer.  So, like, if you succeed, you feel all smart.<br/><br/>Yes, I took practice LSATs for fun; I am a big nerd, but I can't imagine I'm alone on that in this hobby.  A friend and I are actually trying to mine the LSAT "logic games" for a system to help GMs create good puzzles.  Has anyone already done something like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195504/#Comment_195504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T12:35:06+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 12:35PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried, and in general, I'm now an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning" rel="nofollow">abduction</a> fan as a GM, rather than forcing deduction via breadcrumbs. We've pondered this a lot in the RPG.net LARP forums, if you want to search around there (keyword mystery). In tabletop, you can wing it a bit more or add clues as necessary to get folks on the right track. In LARP, not so much. And it provides more player authority, too; though, yes, it takes away some of the mystery if the investigators' players are coming up with the clues (so to speak).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195509/#Comment_195509" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T13:32:17+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  1:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Artman, Berg's game <i>Out There</i> has 100% player authorship of clues and indeed of the whole mystery.  Just for the record.  Abduction is how you determine what the mystery is, in effect, as well as its solution.<br/><br/>That said, Berg - I've played around with this in Call of Cthulhu.  The big one: I sketch-conlanged the mystic language Aklo, and some of my players (and their characters) picked up on consistencies across adventures in our floating campaign, to the point that I was able to use it reliably to seed clues into the game.  Honestly, I was just looking to involve a reticent player who trained as a linguist; it worked.  But other people picked up on it too, and it was fun, made everyone feel smarter, and never stretched the fiction.<br/><br/>Another time, I had the players get zapped into an extradimensional space with the topology of a 12-sided die's adjacency diagram.  We played Hunt the Wumpus in that space for a while until the players figured out that they needed to traverse the rooms in a certain order, based on a clue that was inked on the wall (in Aklo!) in something like blood...<br/><br/>But getting these things into the fiction is pretty hard.  It's not making puzzles that's the hard part for GMs.  What's hard is avoiding having the players gratuitously figure out how old Bob and Sally are, given that Bob is now half again as old as Sally, and [...<a href="/forums/search?Search=%23include&amp;Mode=like">#include</a> "lsat.h"...].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195520/#Comment_195520" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T15:26:24+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  3:26PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, man, I think I would have had a blast in those games.

I used to have "boredly cycle through every permutation" happen when trying to, say, open a combo lock.  Now I avoid this by having each attempt cost resources.<br/><br/>Anyway, I figure different GMs and different groups find different parts of this hard.

I just couldn't imagine how that would fit into the fiction, unless the characters were taking the old GRE in-game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Setting the puzzle into the fiction is the hard part.  If your game has magical devices and/or dimensional shenanigans, there's your in.  Take a puzzle like Josh's, which as stated isn't very useful for story gaming.  But it could specify the order of the magical words that must be spoken to activate the power of a Rod of Kewlness (which, if you get it wrong, does something unspeakable to you).  Better yet - to activate <i>a</i> power, with more in store in later puzzles. <br/><br/>As another example: The traversal order puzzle in my Cthulhu game was actually very simple - it just required the characters (via the players) to determine that the rooms were labeled, and to figure out how numerals were written in Aklo.  To complicate it, I put in two ticking clocks. There was a slow but large monster chasing the players through the space; it showed up in whatever room they were in every five real-time minutes and would have eaten an investigator every round if they hadn't run away, which, being experienced investigators, they did from the get-go.  Plus there was the problem that every door the characters walked through was actually a magic gate that dinged them for 0/1 SAN.  This led to a pretty satisfying two-hourish session, all the better because it was a wild divergence from my usual drama-driven fare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195543/#Comment_195543" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T18:37:48+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  6:37PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/>\nThanks for the links.<br/>\nI think they may help with You Dunnit.<br/>\ntomg                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195545/#Comment_195545" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T18:58:47+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  6:58PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if this is relevant to something you're working on or not, but I heard in a podcast interview that a game Epidiah Ravachol and his gang were working on was going to use a mechanic based on working, as a group, on a math/logic puzzle (a Sudoku, or something based on that concept anyway).
