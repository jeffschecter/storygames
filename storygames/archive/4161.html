I like the 'cast and they seem nice as well, but I felt their comments were off base and, filled with spit and vinegar, I jumped onto their site and posted a reply. They were very welcoming in their reply and I almost regretted my earlier irrascible tone...almost <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>With some trepidation, I thought I would cross-post here as well. Actually, I think they bring up interesting points that come up when speaking to 'traditional' gamers on the topic of 'story' games.\n<blockquote>I am in the middle of listening to your comments on indie games and find myself gnashing my teeth and screaming at my iPod. I don't personally care if you like story games or not, but I do think you should at least know what you're talking about before you speak. A few points: <br/><br/>1. Speaking about all indie games while talking about only one of them (Spirit of the Century) is patently unfair. <br/>2. You obviously have never played Spirit of the Century. Your point of view about the game would be more relevant if you know what you were talking about. <br/><br/>To clarify. Yes Spirit of the Century codifies traits called Aspects. Aspects are how you tell the GM what you want the story to be "about." If you have the "Don't tell me the odds" aspect, you are saying "I want my character to get into risky situations." Its not about GM railroading. You choose it because you want it. Contrast that to D&amp;D where you may roll up a thief because you want to be cool and sneaky but the story may be all about battle fields or gladiator combat. <br/><br/>Second, the players are all involved in creating story in the game. That means the players want conflict and complications for their own characters. You mention the GM can force the character's hand by putting a chip down. That's called a compell in the game. The GM *offers* the character a chip for having his aspect create further complications in the story, because the GM is saying "I think it would be cool story if your character did this...". The player has chips as well and if he does not like the GMs offer he can pay a chip to get out of it, essentially saying "I don't think that sounds like cool story." If the player he accepts, he gets the chip. They're called Fate Points, btw. The player spends Fate Points to invoke his aspect in a conflict to do awesome things, like get a +2 to his roll (which is a huge + in SOTC). So if the player has "I always protect little critters" as an aspect and she's fighting to protect fluffy, the player can spend a fate point and say "but, you know, 'I always protect little critters!" and invoke their aspect to be more awesome. <br/><br/>Lastly, the player can compell his own negative aspects. They may be chasing the bad guy but want to add further complication by seizing narrative control. They compell their aspect "I always protect little critters!" this time getting a Fate Point rather than spending one, and say "I see fluffy caught in a tree and a wrecking ball is swinging towards her, what do I do?" And that's the other cool thing. You, the player, can spend fate points to put aspects on scenes to use in conflict like "Its dark in that corner" or "The ground is uneven." You can also put aspects on your oponent rather than damage, like "I push you and you're off balance" or "there's sand in your eyes." Then other players can compell those aspects to get benefits. <br/><br/>My last point is that you may hate spirit of the century and games like it, which is fine with me. But I think you should play the game first, speak second. <br/>posted by: Noclue on Wed, 9/5 12:20 PM EDT <br/><br/>First welcome to the 'cast! <br/><br/>Great comments all. I hope you'll cut and paste this in the forum, it will probably get a little more attention there. <br/><br/>I don't think we really got it wrong, but there definitely is some room for clarification. <br/><br/>There seems to be, from the people I'm talking about, the concept that 'indie' games are 'story games'. I personally consider Cheap Ass Games, or any beer and pretzel system, to be part of the indie game scene as well, but hardly pushing story. <br/><br/>My problem, specifically with SotC, is "he can pay a chip to get out of it," There's mechanics for the GM to force your character in a direction. Eventually the player runs out of chips. When a player plays a thief, the decision to pick a pocket is solely that of the player. In this system the GM can push the player in a direction through a mechanics. <br/><br/>Don't take our dislike of part of a system as condemnation of a game. I've got huge issues with large parts of D&amp;D, I still play it. So, take the conversation, using SotC as an example, was more about a style rules, over a condemnation of a specific game. <br/><br/>Keep the feedback coming! <br/></blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.grimmstudios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=131&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15&amp;sid=d122b4e4e1bd3f61b6258cb6f7af72cd" rel="nofollow">Grimm Studios Episod 9</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jimmiebjr" title="jimmiebjr"><img alt="jimmiebjr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jimmiebjr">jimmiebjr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93302/#Comment_93302" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T19:09:10+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  7:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>My problem, specifically with SotC, is "he can pay a chip to get out of it," There's mechanics for the GM to force your character in a direction.

It "forces" a player to occasionally play to their weaknesses, which does not necessarily lead in any given direction. The resolution of a scene that involves a Compel is still very much up to the GM <i>and</i> the players, through their Aspects. A Compel is not a switch on a railroad track and I honestly believe that anyone who has read the relevant section in SotC would at least know that.<br/><br/>The other thing they'd know, if they had read into that section at all is that <i>anyone</i> can Compel an aspect. Do the podcasters then object to another player being able to "force a character in a direction" ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93319/#Comment_93319" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T21:19:35+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  9:19PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They haven't played the game and I don't think they have read the game.

Especially given that he put Temptations from the Dark Side as an aspect on his sheet, already flagging it as a cool thing he wants story to happen around?  From where I stand, the answer to that question is "no".<br/><br/>IME, players accept compels 90% of the time -- the aspects on their sheet are there and compellable because that's where the heart of their character's story lives.<br/><br/>That remaining 10%, where they want to resist it, gains a feeling of real significance when they have to pay for it.  Not having to pay for it can have the effect of cheapening the <i>story value</i> of resisting the temptation.<br/><br/>This is not to say that a GM can't decide to back off if he's not feeling the love for the compel.  GMs are human, and can misread the situation, misunderstand that this is a case where the player wants to have to make a tough choice around their aspect.

"Who needs rules for conversation?" Followed by a discussion of how they use D&amp;D's diplomacy roll to resolve verbal conflicts, but if the<i>player</i>makes a compelling argument the DM "starts adding up modifiers in his head." I think that fosters a game where more outgoing players, or players who the DM likes more, get arbitrary benefits. I'm not sure why that is better than the Duel of Wits mechanic in BW or Dogs' "just talking" mechanics. I've posted as much on the forum.</blockquote>\n(shrug) That's the way I run things, and I've yet to hear a compelling argument to do otherwise. This may be the sim-gamer in me talking, but I don't feel it's appropriate to not give the PC with a better diplomacy score due benefit in an interactive scene, nor do I feel it appropriate not to factor in a player-prompted <i>faux pas</i> into an NPC's response.<br/><br/>Due the nature of PCs as icons of the players, but the desire to let players play characters who are different from them, I think it works well to conflate the two. I sort of see the players narration as a matter of "announcing intent" and the mechanics reflecting the delivery, to include intangible social aspects such as tone and body language and timing that aren't implicit in the player narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93699/#Comment_93699" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T10:38:37+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 10:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alan, do you do the same with combat, to the same degree?

You're still using mechanics to resolve conflict. The difference is 1. how much you leave open to GM fiat and 2. How quickly you resolve the conflict and move on to other stuff. In BW, the Battle of Wits is what the games is "about" at that particular moment. You don't want to get on to the real story. So the mechanics let you play it out and play it out hard in a series of exchanges. The dice tell you who wins an exchange and GM and players call bullshit if there is an obvious faux pas or mis-statement, but otherwise the dice guide the action as in a physical conflict. In a diplomacy roll, it gets the talking part out of the way quickly and implies that the mechanics don't view social conflict as worth spending much time on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93739/#Comment_93739" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:06:58+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Alan, do you do the same with combat, to the same degree?</blockquote>\nEr, does this warrant a new thread?<br/><br/>I think it does...<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4177" rel="nofollow">LINK</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93742/#Comment_93742" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:15:04+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:15PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noclue... responding to you in the other thread too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93758/#Comment_93758" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:53:28+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hiya everybody!<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I'd swing by from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://grimmstudios.libsyn.com" rel="nofollow">Grimm Studios</a> and possibly clear a few things up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst clarification, no, we haven't played SotC.  We were using it as an example of a concept, which we, mostly disagree with.  Again, some of the hosts (Tate comes immediately to mind) did see a place for such mechanics, but still prefers a more open character situation.  This was not meant as a review of the product, merely a discussion of a game style.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, iago (great name) will come on and talk about Spirit of the Century with a little more depth.  Just so everyone is clear, that's an open invite to him.  Non confrontational, relaxed atmosphere, with him getting final nod on releasing the interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked a little with noclue on our discussion of diplomacy roles and how that is indeed a social mechanic already.  He is right, we have been using them.  But it doesn't mean I like them.  Some of the players at are table right now are very new.  I'm trying to change as few of the rules as possible so they don't get frustrated by the books not being accurate.  That, unfortunately, means things such as diplomacy, etc.  I believe I also mentioned that in the game I wrote for myself, Int, Wis, Char, or any social or similar stat is ultimately unnecessary, because it can be covered with good RP.  Which is my preference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see rules as restrictions, and when you put one in my social structure I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t help but feel that what you just did.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve yet to hear a gaming story from a social system that couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be done with good RP.  Ultimately, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s about what each of us need from gaming.  And that's why open gaming, and lots of different systems are good.  Even if you're just pillaging the rules you like into one game for your table (the way we used to do it).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of all of it, it's 5ish of us talking and all of you listening.  Odds are were going to disagree with some of you, even most of you from time to time.  It's a matter of numbers, and not everyone has the same experience.  Hopefully that won't stop people from listening, if so, then I'm sorry.  Jim (one of the hosts) and I disagree on quite a few things about gaming, but we still have a blast gaming with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe take our audience really seriously.  We know we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re not the only way to game.  But if you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t tell us your point of view, we can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t talk about it on the show.

And they didn't need to, because it was all about fighting monsters and taking their stuff.

The social debate can actually be had at the table.  Outside of a LARP the fight actually can't.  I view systems as things necesairy for that which can't actually be done, or reasonablly extrapolated.<br><br>Everytime you pick up a die (or any other system for resolving disputes), naration slows.  We wait for the mechanic to resolve and carry on.  <br><br>Furthermore, In a social dynamic you can't actually make someone change their mind if they don't want to.  In a physical one you can actually make them bleed if they don't want to.  A mechanic to determine the winner is needed.<br><br>And that's one outsider's view on such systems.  If you're going to get someone to plunk down $x for a book, you have to convince the buyer that this will add something to their play.  More rules to do something they can just act out is a hard sell.  Couple it with the feeling of loosing control of your character, and we move further down that road to the bargin bin of a FLGS.<br><br>I'm a rules slut.

Just as physical combat rules allow people who couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag to totally devastate a dragon, so should social combat rules allow people who can't talk their way out of the bag to totally dominate a debate. We can try to play out such things at the table, but it really only comes down to trying to describe <i>how </i>we want our characters to behave. A complete rules set should allow players to simply say, "I want to convince this guy to X" and roll for it, as easily as they say, "I want to kill this guy" and roll for it.  'Course, just 'cause a rule set is complete, doesn't mean you have to use all the rules if they don't fit the play group (but then, that's another debate entirely).<br/><br/>Q                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93795/#Comment_93795" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:03:23+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2007 2:03PM by Judd.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing that I don't see anyone saying is that the players author those aspects.<br/><br/>If they have an aspect: Thief, that means they want to be do thief-y stuff and want to run from the law.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, if someone put down Thief, I'd want more.

Big fan.  Last character I played was a cripple with a crushed hip.  Lowered movement, penalty to all kinds of rolls, and limited ability and skills.  Did it with 3.5 rules.  Just chose to run the draw back as a way to explain a low dex.  The rest of the skill/feat hits were voluntary.  This, again, is something that afects mechanics that can't be acted out.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-<br/>\nThat is a problem of the completely open end of things.  When that happens the players have to open their RP a bit and accept some things.  Some of our new players are still really shy, I let them get away with 'tell me the jist of what you're going for' then let them know the results as if their character would have delivered the speech.  It takes some inference on the GM's part, but done well, I've been slowly helping them open up, and do more and more with interaction.  I feel like if there was a mechanic, they'd use it as more of a crutch, and that progress might be slower.  Just my feeling though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudd -<br/>\nDoing all with out compels, or social mechanics:<br/>\n<br/>\nPrince of Thieves<br/>\n"Excuse me peasant." as the guard reaches for some fruit.  If the player says anything, does anything that continues to call attention to them.  Familiarity ensues.  If not, they don't form a lasting impression.<br/>\n<br/>\nGritty Thief<br/>\nThe guard is turning your direction, still searching.<br/>\n<br/>\n"I want him to see me..."  oh boy.<br/>\n"I duck into the crowd"  Hide check.<br/>\n<br/>\nDashing Thief Compel:<br/>\nThis hardly needs any compel.  Try and score an accomplace, or loot the place on your own, but know now that time is ticking, and she'll be trying to beet you to the goods.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes "Acccidental" exposition on the GM's part will dangle that twist of fate before them.  Give the players consiquences for their actions, any actions, and everything becomes a compel.  Give them a hint at the possible things that could come from their choices, either way, and watch them wiggle with the decision.  Play the little devil on their shoulder.  Goad them forward.  But don't force.  Forget to tell them all the bad things about facing their brother's hanger.  LIke jail time.  Just remind them, that a quick fight, and over the wall, and revenge is had right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93811/#Comment_93811" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:32:37+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alan,<br><br>We're not communicating here; we're trying to convince each other.<br><br>I'm not trying to convince you.<br><br>I'm show that the way you thought compels worked was not how they worked.

(Other than the fact it uses Fudge, which I already appreciated.) Once upon a time on RPG-create (an old mailing list/egroup/yahoo group some of you may be familiar with) I was tinkering with a mechanic around compulsory effects in traditional RPGs. Things like the fear mechanic in D&amp;D (or artificial means of eliciting fear in players, like level drain) always sort of made me feel uncomfortable with baldly removing player choice. But at the same time, I wanted them to behave appropriately.<br><br>So I came up with a mechanic I called conviction. The players would have points that they could spend to<br>- avoid such compulsions, or<br>- to gain benefit from their traits.<br>I reasoned that instead of forcing players to act appropriately, you could sort of bribe them to do so.<br><br>And lo, I get FATE (and later on, SotC, which more strongly resembles my old compulsion mechanic than FATE does), and there's aspects, which strongly resembles my old compulsion mechanic. Great minds and all that.<br/><br/>Given this, I find it oddly ironic to see someone point to unnecessary compulsion of their characters under SotC, when I came up with a mechanic very similar to the aspect mechanic precisely to deal with my concern over how heavy handed methods of compelling behavior were in traditional games.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93822/#Comment_93822" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:50:40+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alan?<br/><br/>Ok, anyway, sorry if I miss understood the intent.

Really, I'm saying I'm lazy, and want to be able to bookmark such a discussion for later reference under its own name. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Regarding the original thread topic specifically, I'd like to point out that the rules don't specifically prohibit a player from negotiating the terms of a compel into one that preserves the character's status better, or whatever. This is something I have flagged for more explicit mention in future Fate games.<br/><br/>Example: SotC has a classic love triangle between the iconic characters - Sally Slick has a "Hidden Crush" on Mack Silver, and Jet Black has "Unspoken Love" for Sally Slick. Mack... well, he has "A Girl in Every Port".<br/><br/>So when Russian supervillain Rocket Red seduces Mack and tries to steal Mack's hi-tech plane, the Century Clipper, for Mother Russia, leaving Jet and Sally on the tarmac as the plane takes off, there's potential for this love triangle to create some tension. I'm talking specifically about the three-player SotC demo I ran to death at GenCon, from which this scenario comes.<br/><br/>So, in one of the demos, I compel Jet Black's player, and say, "Mack Silver is always doing this kind of shit, and there's probably nothing suspicious going on. You just know Sally's going to check things out and get jealous and disappointed because he's taking some girl he met last night for a joyride. You totally need to convince her to stay on the ground."<br/><br/>Instead of buying off the compel, the player looks at me and says, "No... actually, here's what the deal is. I'm tired of him always doing this crap to Sally and hurting her feelings, because I love her, and I'm going to fly up there and beat the living tar out of Mack Silver and give him a piece of my mind, regardless of whether or not he's really in trouble."<br/><br/>Naturally, I gave him the fate point and looked at Mack's player and said, "Man, you're in deep shit."<br/><br/>Really, what a compel does is signal that drama should play a greater role in resolving events than dice. If the GM throws down for a compel, it's a signal that he or she wants to see something interesting and dramatic happen, for things to get complicated, and the specific terms are the one idea he or she came up with. That doesn't necessarily mean it's the GMs way or the highway - if your GM uses compels to establish absolute authority over your character, dunk their head in the damn toilet, repeatedly, and then exit to the nearest pub.<br/><br/>Instead, the player should look for an opportunity to call for their own dramatic complication, one that might fit how they envision their character better. <br/><br/>So, you have "Greedy as a Greedy Fool", and a big crime boss is offering you money to sell out your friends. The GM holds up the tasty fate point. You can say, "You know... I don't see him really selling out his friends. But I do see him lying to this guy about it to get the money, and this guy finding out about it later."  If I were the GM there, I'd go, "Make an enemy of a big crime boss in exchange for automatic success on Deceit? Deal," and hand the point over.<br/><br/>Just sayin'. Many things can be remedied by the bringing of your own awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93847/#Comment_93847" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T15:26:47+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  3:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben -<br/><br/>I don't know about anyone else, but my comment was about fixing other systems, but fixing a problem within gaming.  Specifically, interaction.  I've never found it broken, and think tables that are lacking in some area could probably be remedied by a less invasive approach.<br/><br/>That said, I've met people who could have a church fall on them and still not get the message.<br/><br/>Judd -<br/><br/>I think something you said is pretty much why I don't run into any of the problems needing such rules.  Steer the game.  <br/><br/>I don't ever steer my games.  My philosophy is that the GM is a set designer and not a director.  He builds the props, the stage, and handles the supporting cast.  But the players drive the story, just not the setting.<br/><br/>And thanks for the GM compliment.  I'm sure anyone who puts enough time into their GMing to read this board, and think about how to do it better is a damn find GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Grimm Comments on Spirit of the Century - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4161/grimm-comments-on-spirit-of-the-century/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Grimm Comments on Spirit of the Century - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4161/grimm-comments-on-spirit-of-the-century/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Leonard: That's a very cool point.

I don't want one player to just decide and then that's that. I want there to be an interaction, a series of proposals, events, reversals, and results (moderated by a non-player-controlled factor, like dice) that lead to an outcome. For most games dealing with the above, this means we engage the combat system, over which no single participant has ultimate authority. It would be weird, I think, in most games, for the GM or a player to <i>just decide</i> that the Duke is stabbed to death because the description of the stabbing was just so good or right or whatever.<br/><br/>So, then:<br/><br/>Player 1: "I convince the Duke to let the Prince go."<br/>Player 2: "Nah... he isn't swayed by your appeal."<br/><br/>What happens next? Do we roleplay it out, and then one player just decides the outcome? That puts one player in a privileged position over the outcome. In most cases, that is probably the person playing the Duke. The Duke's player is in total control over what convinces him and what doesn't, and she controls the outcome of all attempts to persuade him. A lot of people like this.<br/><br/>But I don't. I don't ever want one player to just decide the outcome of any situation. That's why I use game mechanics. I don't use mechanics just for things that can't be acted out at the table.

Not so much in complexity, but volume of situations.  As players talk at the table, I take note of their goals.  It helps me pick out the scenes that are going to need the most fleshing out.

Anything with other people is ultimately compromise.  Sometimes the story goes your way, sometimes it doesn't.  That's a lot more palatable when you know you have full rights on how your little corner of the world reacts to it.

One has mechanics for social conflict and the other, of course, does not. What's interesting about the episode is that it demonstrates how a <i>lack</i> of mechanics for social conflict means that all inter-character conflict has to be resolved at the inter-player level. Others have made this point, I know, but it really comes across when you hear the two instances side-by-side. And it's worth understanding at a deep level: all inter-character conflict has to be resolved at the <i>inter-player</i> level. Whether this is okay or not is debatable, but it underscores that when we're talking about "social mechanics" we're really talking about our theories about the interpersonal aspects of play, by which I mean what happens at the table rather than in the fiction.

In their function as "disadvantage replacements", all aspects do is convert things to "pay as you play" instead of "pay up front".  Which for me, looking back on my years as a Champions player and GM, is great -- too many Disads were dead weight on sheets.

Other than I'm not 100% certain its my job to convince anyone to do anything. What caught my attention wasn't the fact that you didn't like compels or social conflict mechanics, it was that your description of them did not match the reality. Accuracy is more important to me than agreement in this regard. <br/><br/>I do value your opinion and I think it accurately reflects the views of a certain demographic. I just would have preferred opinions that were informed by actual play and a real understanding of the games and the mechanics that you were discussing.

Apparently (despite all evidence to contrary), no one can be convinced or forced into a social situation, nor can someone be convincing or intimidating, but I sure can beat the ever living daylights out of you without your consent.  And as someone who has watched dozens of these games proceed on a large scale, it seems every time I devalue the ability to affect a character emotionally or mentally, the ability to affect them physically becomes tantamount to everything else. Its far more important that I be able to whip your ass because its really the only way I can make a lasting change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think the argument of "well shy folks have right to play social butterflies too", should be turned on its head, and instead it is incredibly unfair to allow socially imposing players to run roughshod over players.  That socially adept player may not necessarily be a jerk and might mean well, but I've seen far too many instances of the guy who is more socially adept leading people to things they really didn't want to do, but because of their presence they were led into something.  In this case there needs to be a buffer between those players, so there won't external social pressure affecting the game experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't make the same mistake you did Grimm, and make gross generalizations about something I didn't experience, but it seems from your posts that much of the filter for social disagreement in your play is the GM. Creating a rule system that is entirely predicated on one guy acting as a filter for results isn't going to lead to great play from table to table, and while it may work at your table in your opinion, it may be this kind omnipresent GMs fiat which has created so many AP horror stories and possible hobby enthusiasts turned off not by a game but by one person's filtering of the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93989/#Comment_93989" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T09:08:38+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  9:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2007 9:09AM by Rob Donoghue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite><br>It sounds like a merrits and flaws system.

So what follows isn't an argument by any stretch - I'm trying to illustrate where my interests differ, but it's so very much not a case for others sharing those interests.<br><br/>For my part, while I enjoy finding workarounds, I don't enjoy it as _much_ as I do the image of the hero facing an internal challenge and, somehow, impossibly, finding the will to overcome it (or to go around it in a way which would probably not work in a realistic universe, but might in a dramatic one - the classic one in a million shot).  These are things I enjoy in my fiction, so I want them in my game.<br/><br/>But you also cut to the heart of the issue in your choice of words: "skip past".  And I have to agree that it's pretty unsatisfying if it just happens.  If a player just says "Oh, man, I'm facing a huge internal struggle.  I'm tired and hurt and pinned down by doubt and there's no way I can go on!  Oh.  Well, ok, there is.  I'm going on." Then that feels cheap to me - it skips past a struggle that is interesting to _me_ (which I do not demand be interesting to all gamers) in favor of a glorified internal monologue.  Now, if I were a bigger fan of mechanics that actively took control from players, there are probably interesting rolls that could be made to make this process as central to play as it is to the fiction which I am (generally speaking) trying to emulate.  But I'm not, so that's a no go.<br/><br/>So I'm left in a situation where I want to put a *price* on those decisions - so the system is making the player work for it, if only a little.  In doing so, I feel this also acknowledges the struggle to the table in the way that a purely internal monologue cannot yet without the risk of grandstanding that a genuine monologue might bring.  So we end up with the cost element of aspects.  Yeah, compel is a nice shorthand for "Create situations where this thing that is important to the player comes up" and there are some best practices that have evolved from play* but none of that is too odd to anyone whose spent time at any table.  It's just that question of internal prices and where to put them that's the difference.<br/><br/>Now, this is not me saying I don't like looking at these things as hard points that demand workarounds any more than I'm suggesting that you don't like a good internal struggle.  But I think we get differing levels of fun from each, nd prioritize them differently.  Which is as it should be.<br/><br/>Anyway, that was a lot of noise to no particular end, so I thank you for your patience.  Sussing out where people find their fun is something I find useful and rewarding in and of itself.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* Personal Tangent, and not directed at Grimm, but just something I've needed to get off my chest: Sweet mother of god, I have never had a compel even slow play down at my table.  Seriously.  I hear it form time to time and it hurts me inside when people talk about how disruptive it is.  It' snot doing it wrong, but it's doing it badly.  Do you ever cringe when someone presents D&amp;D as the GM reading literally from the boxed text, ignoring the players, and  basically making D&amp;D into a much-less-funny version of Orc and Pie?  I know I do, and it's pretty much the exact same thing.

I think that's important, especially when I've seen players fall into a routine of how they deal with another players character socially in the game.  I do very much agree that making social situations gameable may take the advantage away from the Type A personalities only to give it to the tactical player, but part of me likes to see the tactical player get caught up in social conflicts and describing those results.

It's absolutely true to say that you can be socially forced into doing something you don't want to, but you can't be forced to like it.  If a confederate beats you up in a civil war game because you hate slavery, it won't make the PC love slavery.   If a social system or compel dictates that you have to fall in love with somebody, your character is being forced to do it <i>and like it</i>.<br><br/>In some social systems, BW's Duel of Wits in particular, this is addressed.  Duel of Wits is a system for "Argument not Mind Control".  This caveat is not present in a more narrativist game like SotC.  A compel might very well change your character's internal life.  It puts another players fingers into parts of the PC that some people are loath to share.<br/><br/>That being said, it should also be said that SotC is a fantastic game, and it is very successful with what it set out to do.  In my games of SotC, compels always worked to the advantage of the fun of the table.  Players are similarly powered to affect the "DM's world" to a greater extent than in a traditional RPG.  In practice, it produces a very fun collaborrative writing experience with a lot of laughs and interaction, and despite the additional DM influence, you never feel like you're not 'in charge' of your character.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94000/#Comment_94000" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T09:44:46+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  9:44AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>If the GM is not stonewalling, characters have a better chance of getting what they want from NPCs</blockquote>\nI'm cool with that.

My only point in that paragraph is to say, that in my experience it leads to a situation where characters don't really try to discuss anything (I can't affect change this way), so instead kill what I don't like (because violence can affect change, and killing a guy makes it permanent).  I don't agree that I should be allowed to change intrinsic things about your character if you disagree, but I also believe that if such an opinion or belief wasn't important enough to put on a character sheet, maybe there is some room to be malleable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94009/#Comment_94009" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T10:05:52+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 10:05AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is so much to comment on here, but I'll go with one thing that I don't think I've heard anyone address specifically.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>In a social dynamic you can't actually make someone change their mind if they don't want to.</blockquote>\nThis is absurd.

Maybe I'm in a casino, dragged there by friends who wanted my company.  I came for them, even though I'm nearly broke and have bills due.  While there a beautiful woman starts flirting with me.  Because I'm weak willed and lonely (This is a hypothetical example for the purposes of argument illustration.  I may or may not actually be weak-willed and lonely.  Offer not valid in Utah, Connecticut, or Hawaii.) I buy her a few overpriced drinks that I can't really afford.

But daaaaamn she's hot, and she really seems to like me!  Do I do it?  Hmmmm... in a roleplaying game this could be handled with "social combat" mechanics, and I think this would be a good idea, because without any mechanics, I just say "No, I don't give her any money, because I know I'm broke and I wouldn't do that."  If you really hold with Grimm's assertion that "In a social dynamic you can't actually make someone change their mind if they don't want to," then this is true... but I'm pretty sure most people out there, if they're being honest, can see that this kind of situation could legitimately occur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94041/#Comment_94041" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T11:46:17+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 11:46AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>So I think those seeing compells as "system-based railroading" or whatever should maybe remember that <b>they themselves choose those aspects because that's what they are interested in for this game</b>.

When picking disads, instead of handling them by frequency, make a pool of points and (buy frequency) pay 1, 2, or 3 points to avoid the disad when the DM tries to invoke it.

You've indicated to the GM that this character is ready and waiting for something like this, and (as I like SoTC, by the way) Bad GM if you let pass Weak Willed and/or Lonely in a casino for chrissakes.<br/><br/>I do still hold with Grimm's assertion that "In a social dynamic you can't actually make someone change their mind if they don't want to," because if a member of the appropriate sex who I've never met before, but is kind of hot, tries to talk me into, say, selling my kid into slavery because she needs a loan, no matter how persuasive she is, ain't gonna happen. Especially if I'm a Doting Father or Zealous Prude.

Absolutely, you can have the money babe, and here, my friend gave me the cash he won to save the orphanage, bet on black 27!  Mechanic or no, players open to the idea of non-them-initiated (?) conflict, social or otherwise, will find it and revel in it, and players attempting to avoid it, or "win," or keep their money, or whatever, will still be a little resentful if they're out of the ability to avoid that loss and are forced into it.<br/><br/><i>edited to not put words in Fred's mouth</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94071/#Comment_94071" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T15:14:19+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  3:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2007 3:16PM by Lord_Minx.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kent</cite>"In a social dynamic you can't actually make someone change their mind if they don't want to,"</blockquote>Maybe it's just me, but when I read that, I always add, mentally, "But they can make you want it, either because the price is so good or the alternative is so bad.". <br/><br/>Sure, you won't renounce your religion because I talk to you, but if I give you money? Sex? Immortality? World Peace? Threaten you with losing your job? With publishing those embarassing photos? Hold a gun to your dogs head?

You cad!  <br/><br/>I see your point, everyone has a price/coercion threshold.  However, the above are also just excellent examples of great situations for players to negotiate their way through, sans mechanic.  The Rock and the Hard Place are wonderful, and I love a most difficult choice as much as the next guy.  The willingness to choose is introduced by the stakes of the opposite choice.<br/><br/>I think there's a great place for social mechanics, and if players are available to allowing big emotional sweeps or shifts to be resolved by the same, or are interested in seeing how the situation grows, more power to them.  I mean, that's why I love dice and randomizers, because they can introduce unanticipated complexity and awesome into the system.<br/><br/>Differnt strokes and all, but there's also something to be said for avoiding a mediating factor (and I personally don't want to be given that out) if I need to decide between giving over the microfilm or seeing my Prized Pomeranian take one in the temple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94077/#Comment_94077" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T15:45:32+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  3:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see a game where a success on a social role lets you know what you'd have to do or say to get the other person to do what you want.<br/><br/>"The only way I'd sleep with you is if I was convinced my wife was cheating on me" is a great start for something.<br/><br/>"My character would never cheat on his wife, ever" is just less interesting.

Adding a temporary Aspect then invoking it for benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a bonus, whatever temp aspect Player A dropped on him could be as much of a complication as a benefit to Player B's seduction attempt. "Heartbroken" is a lot more of a double-edged sword than "Blinded".<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also some nice examples in the book about using investigation skills to sniff out Aspects innate to the other person, for leverage. There's a way you can screw that up to give <i>them</i> knowledge of one of your Aspects, instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the leverage you can get from information gathering is what made social conflicts in SotC really grab me. You get this flow of "Okay, I know <i>this</i> is important to him, so that's where I apply leverage..." Not a death spiral, but "Doesn't matter if he replaces his minions or recovers from that bullet, I got this bastard's number now". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20"

mechanics for social situations I'm saying that I think it's possible to convince anyone to do anything.  This is not my position at all.  Just as some things are impossible to accomplish physically, so some things would be impossible to accomplish socially.  Or very nearly impossible.  I think I said something along the lines of:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>changing a persons core beliefs should probably not be possible though normal debate and conversation.</blockquote>\nAnd I imagine that most people have "Don't Sell My Children Into Slavery" as a core belief.  Hence, that shouldn't be possible outside of magical mind control or something like that.<br/>However, one of the big problems with the whole "role-play it out" position is that, even if the player and the character have the same levels of intellect, charm, and social skill, the situation is very, very different.  Let's go back to the fairly simple example of an attractive man/woman (your choice) attempting to convince you to do something you don't really want to do.  Now, if you're really really good at "immersing" yourself into your role-play, then sure, when you're role-playing this situation, maybe you feel a bit of the emotions that are involved when flirting with a person you find highly attractive, but really, it's probably really not anywhere close to how you feel when something like that is ACTUALLY happening.<br/>When you're role-playing something out its very easy to take a pretty high-reason, intellect-focused stand.  It's easy to think about it logically, "Well gosh, my character is a decent person, he wouldn't cheat on his wife, even if he IS drunk, angry with her, and being hit on by one of the hottest women he's ever met."  On the other hand, in that actual situation, there are going to be a whole lot of different things going through a persons mind and the voice saying that may very well be drowned out by all the other voices in the man's head (and other body parts).<br/>That's another problem with this idea of "In a social dynamic you can't actually make someone change their mind if they don't want to," figuring out what exactly a person really does want.  Most real people are NOT single minded machines.  They have a huge variety of different thoughts, feelings, and ideas running through their heads at any given time. <br/><br/>Hell, I'd say that a significant part of a "social combat mechanic" situation isn't necessarily figuring out whether or not someone is able to convince a character to do or think something, but rather trying to figure how what the character REALLY believes most strongly (He's always thought he was a "good cop" but that's an awful lot of money, maybe he could look the other way just this once...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94105/#Comment_94105" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T20:45:31+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  8:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've seriously been thinking about getting back into hero.

One of my friends/players disagreed and made the point about the skills on the character sheet representing the abilities of the character. It was hard to disagree with this, and it was one of my issues with RM I spent a long time struggling to solve. I remember talking about giving bonuses for roleplaying, but not much else.<br/><br/>I think part of my reluctance to settle issues through the system was a lack of satisfying mechanics for it. Rolemaster's system for skill vs. skill situations was lacking in general, not to mention social conflict situations. It was learning HeroQuest, about 4 years ago(?), that began bringing me around to idea that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> kinds of disagreements can be settled through the system. And since then, social conflict mechanics have of course flourished.<br/><br/>Btw; I had a lot of fun overseeing my first Spirit of the Century chargen session two weeks ago.

Who better knows when it's time for the twist?  Your friends and players?  Or the system?<br/><br/>Again, this is from an oursider's view.  Once I pick up the system, I may see where you're all comming from.  But right now, that's my take on what's being described.<br/><br/>On the second comment,<br/><br/>I'd do away with rolling initiative too, if I thought there was a fair way to play out combat.  As a black belt, and someone who's done several combat larps, I understand that real combat can be subtle too.  But the results rarely are.  <br/><br/>In a social or story situation, deflection of a comment point, or whatever doesn't simply result in 'hurt/not hurt', which at the end of the day, is all combat really decides.  And if the hurt count get's high enough, 'dead' becomes the third option.<br/><br/>Social and story spiderweb out from every interaction.  There is no 'hurt/not hurt', no 'good/bad'  meerely 'change'.  As a person I have the faculties to study each crack as it radiates out from the point of impact, and follow the ones that interest me, and leave the others behind.  I can decide if I even want to follow any of the paths that just opened up.<br/><br/>Once you turn some of that over to a system, I can't help but wonder if you're not loosing some of the finer subtleties that could have been enhanced through a purely RP scenerio.  I think more needs to be done to help people RP better, but I don't know that mechanics will fix that.  I almost think, in the long run, they'll hurt, as people begin to count on the system to run their story, and less on their own input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94660/#Comment_94660" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T09:09:27+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  9:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite><br/>But through mechancis a part of my character I liked, is now gone. The character I wanted, no longer exists.  </blockquote>\nThis is a key statement.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve found that losing control of a character isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t limited to games with rules for social conflicts.  It happens in traditional games as well when players disagree.  Sometimes the players will come to an amicable agreement.  But other times, one or the other will have to back down even though that player is not convinced.<br/>The other day I was playing Hollow Earth Expeditions and I wanted my character to give the native \xe2\u20ac\u02dcHollow Earther\xe2\u20ac\u2122 a derringer pistol.  The GM, through an NPC, said that was a bad idea.  I insisted.  The GM repeated his warnings that it was a bad idea and we had a bit of back and forth.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not that familiar with HEX, so I should have asked if the game included rules for social conflicts.  As it was, I did not feel like arguing with the GM.  So I backed down, but it felt like the wrong choice for how I wanted to play the character.    <br/>I like social conflict rules because they provide a mechanism whereby a character can be convinced or fooled or whatever, but the player doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have to be.  I also recognize the possibility and consequences of losing a social conflict going into the game.  Were I unwilling to accept the consequences, I wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t play the game.  In games without rules for social conflict, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d expect the GM to either remain neutral to a character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s actions and focus on the consequences; or, perhaps, out of character explain how the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s actions might impact the story.  In the HEX game example, the GM could have said \xe2\u20ac\u02dcdon\xe2\u20ac\u2122t give away your pistol, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll need it\xe2\u20ac\u2122 or something like that.  I was unconvinced by the argument asking rhetorically \xe2\u20ac\u02dcwould you give a gun to a child?\xe2\u20ac\u2122  Maybe not, but neither would I leave a child in a jungle full of triceratops and Tyrannosaurus Rex.  All in all, that was a minor bump in an enjoyable game.    <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94665/#Comment_94665" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T09:26:03+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  9:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>The GM, through an NPC, said that was a bad idea.

Clearly defined boundaries between who plays what usually does away with this sort of thing.  He might be a great GM in general, but what I'm driving at is keeping control of the players characters with the players.<br/><br/>If he said: "These simply don't exist in this setting."  That's one thing.  I, personally, don't have bards and sorcerors in D&amp;D tables I run.  But that's a setting issue, and not a player one.<br/><br/>GM/storytellers have enough control without needing to strong arm players into a choice that might not be fun for them.  Now the players have to live with that choice, but it should still be available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94666/#Comment_94666" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T09:26:54+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  9:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>It happens in traditional games as well when players disagree.</blockquote>\nIMO, deprotagonization is way easier in traditional, conflict-resolution-less, GM-is-God RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94681/#Comment_94681" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T10:24:06+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 10:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 10:26AM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>This, to me, is a bad GM mistake..</blockquote>\nA lot, perhaps all, of the frustrating gameplay issues that crop up in RPGs could be solved by people learning to play right.  That's not necessarily an easy thing to teach, especially since there is so much variance between playstyles.  A lot of these new fangled mechanics are aimed to make "playing right" a built-in function of the rules.  I agree that you can lose some subtlety and freedom in the transition, but it's still a valiant goal for a game designer.<br/><br/>(naturally, guys, "playing right" is different for different games, different situations, there's no one way to roleplay, etc, etc. Nevertheless- playing right FTW)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94683/#Comment_94683" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T10:26:00+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 10:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite><cite>Ben Lehman</cite>I'd love to see a game where a success on a social role lets you know what you'd have to do or say to get the other person to do what you want.<br/><br/>"The only way I'd sleep with you is if I was convinced my wife was cheating on me" is a great start for something.<br/><br/>"My character would never cheat on his wife, ever" is just less interesting.

The principle as I see it doesn't say "the dragon made the Diplomacy check, so you're convinced"; instead, it's "the dragon made its Diplomacy check; tell me what it would take to convince you to spare its life and let it keep its hoard."  The players would then tell this thing, and the dragon could then decide if it wanted to make any of those offers.  There's no enforced change, but there is an improvement of the flow of information that would make the change possible (or perhaps there is enforced change, in that what you say it would take to convince you <i>must</i> convince you if it is then offered).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94771/#Comment_94771" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:07:14+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>For the first comment, I think it comes down to who do you trust more to make a fun twist for your game?

Other times (based on my mood or whatever), I'll play a different RPG where the same rules do not apply.<br/><br/>For example, these days I pretty much dislike any game where it requires more than 20 minutes to make a character from scratch.  My favorite games tend to take less than 5 minutes. However, in Spirit of the Century (as it's topical to this discussion) it usually takes 15-30 minutes to make a character. The reasons:<br/><br/>1) There's lots of little rules to look up.<br/>2) (MAIN) You have to do a lot of incorporation with other characters: There's a section where you decide who met who in which previous "novel" you appeared in, and what that "novel" was about. This takes quite a bit of time, about half the character generation time or more.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is awesome. It's not for all my games, but it's an essential component of this game, and it's fun as hell (in fact, I suggest that the Role-Playing actually STARTS at character generation in SOTC).<br/><br/>Alternately, I don't tend to enjoy violence in games. I started thinking about it, and for the last few years I've had few games where I played (as a player) someone violent who was out to kill dudes, be it mooks or Named NPCs. However, I LOVE the ultra-violence in Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, and in fact disengage my "safety switch" when running or playing that game (and yet, 95% of the violence is towards evil demons, not actual humans).<br/><br/>Sometimes I want absolute full control over what my character does, says and thinks. Other times (in other games) I'm willing to take a back seat at times, or put my beliefs "on the table" to be affected by change.<br/><br/>Different games, different play styles.<br/><br/>For me, saying "Gaming is more enjoyable *this way*" tends to be narrow minded about all the various kinds of games out there. Back in 1990, we could probably say definitively what we did and didn't find good about "gaming".  Nowadays (post 1991, probably) it makes more sense to say "In *these* games, it's better to..." or "I like games where...". I think relativism on this front entered the scene right around the time Vampire 1e came out.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94798/#Comment_94798" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:45:29+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>it comes down to who do you trust more to make a fun twist for your game?

I trust the system to tell me when it's time, or at least give me the right tools, to trust my friends and players to give me a fun twist.  Ultimately, the answer is "your friends and players"; but you see system as an impediment to that trust, whereas I see it as an enhancement of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94866/#Comment_94866" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T16:58:42+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  4:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that -- if it's a make-or-break issue that you don't want, say, your character to be corruptible, I think you tell the group your wishes regardless of the system.

Now when a conflict comes up in one of those shows, I DO feel tense.  You may not care for those shows themselves, but the popularity of them suggests that there is something enjoyable about that dynamic in a story.<br/><br/>The Indy thing is a poor choice for an RPG character anyway.  In those types of stories, it's a biography.  We know how many minutes are left, so we know he has some living to do.<br/><br/>In an RPG, there are a group of characters.  And it is the story of the group.  Not all of them may make it.  That uncertainty makes each success all the more sweet, and doubt helps grow the characters.  Sometimes together, sometimes apart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96199/#Comment_96199" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T20:54:04+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  8:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2007 8:54PM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>With that constant safety net, do you ever find yourself doing crazy things because you know you're safe?

A conflict feels weak when death is the primary thing on the line. To paraphrase Matt in PTA: if you can't kill a castmember, then there better be something else on the line that the audience cares about. Despite the Redshirt cliche, old Trek managed to put something else on the line in almost every episode. The threat of death was only the metaphore what what was really at stake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a show where we know the main characters aren't likely to die only puts the main characters in danger, it's ho hum. When it puts something else in danger at the same time it's interesting. This is what many story games do.

And, because so much is on the line in those moments, the game takes on heightened tension that can definitely rock. I don't want those moments coming down to a single saving throw.

D&amp;D, e.g., needs to have PC always at risk of death, because the challenge aspect becomes pretty hollow otherwise. Hit Points are one of the many resources the players pit against the threats the DM throws at them, and combat is the primary kind of challenge being faced. If the PCs are immune to death, even from one bad roll, then D&amp;D becomes pretty pointless, IMO.<br/><br/>OTOH, in games like DitV and SotC, the odds that a PC is going to die are pretty miniscule. It definitely won't happen unless the player specifically wants to put that option in the stakes. To say that makes those games boring would be ludicrous.<br/><br/>I think it's kind of weird to find Indiana Jones movies or pulp boring because you know the main character(s) won't die. I mean, that's true of most fiction; does that make most fiction boring? Conversely, is it really being true to the genre if, in a pulp RPG, a PC can die because they biff some random check? Much less any RPG that's primarily about themes and not challenge? Is that fun?<br/><br/>It's about context. Some games would be pointless without PC death, and some games would be pointless with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96318/#Comment_96318" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T10:12:22+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 10:12AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>I think it's kind of weird to find Indiana Jones movies or pulp boring because you know the main character(s) won't die.</blockquote>\nFor accuracy, Chris didn't say he found Indiana Jones movies boring.

Is it ok to kill a character due to a random dice roll.  I always, as a GM, felt a little guilty when it happened.  Then Jim pointed something out to me.<br/><br/>Rarely, if ever, is the situation calling for the die roll random.  Indy isn't going to die in the spikes because Winnie didn't make here will save.  He's going to die because he brought a 12 year old into a pit of death and destruction and then had the nerve to act upset when he failed a roll.  The risk was calculated before the situation was entered.  Now, he got out of that one ok.  But he stepped into it knowing the risk.<br/><br/>If your game is:  Ok, I wake up in the morning.  Roll will save.  Sorry you die.  Then, no, that sucks.  If it's, I see the pit, it's unlikely I'll make it but I have to try.  Then you CHOSE to take the chance.  You chose that to be the story.  Pass or fail.  Live or die.  I offset my odds by taking a running start.  Modifier up. etc.  If you're new to such things, the GM and table should take that in consideration, and maybe offer some suggestions.  But not do it for you.  Let you tell your story up to the point of chance, then see what chance has in store.  The whole table holds their breath.... and then screams with joy, or cries with despair.<br/><br/>In our example on our podcast, it was a mine shaft where the elevator had been cut.  It was the only way down (for various story related reasons), and they had to get to the bottom to rescue a husband of a PC from some slavers.  They were fixing rope, considering their odds, deciding who should go first, swearing a blue streak that no one took rope use or climb, but pushing ahead anyway.  Of the 7 players, Jim, Katie, Anders died.  Amber almost did.  And the others had to decide if they would push on, or turn back.<br/><br/>Everyone made the choice.  Jim walked around it, and even said out loud "I bet my death is in that pit".  Granted, he survived to the bottom, but found himself alone, fighting bugbears over the body of Katie who fell some 60'.  Amber, took some daring jumps to help with the fight.  She was too late to save him, but was able to clear the landing for the rest of the team to crawl down slower.  Clinging to life, she hid somewhere safe until she could signal the rest to come down.<br/><br/>Every death, though painful, added to the story.  Rescuing Connie's husband (her back story choice, not one pushed on her) became a heroic tale, and not just another crawl.  Each death weighed on the people taking the risk to go further.  Some were stuck half way down, knowing they now had to take a very real risk to go back or forward.  The weight of each player falling pulled at the characters.  All continued knowing that their character lived or died on a roll for a skill they didn't have.<br/><br/>I asked them at the end, if they had fun.  It was unanimous.  The new players, old players, everyone.  Each dice roll was an adrenalin rush.  The attempts to catch people as they fell past.  The wishing they had thought of different ways to approach the problem.  And finally completing the mission and deciding to retire their characters.  So much death had broken the character's spirits, but not the players.  They already had ideas for their next characters, and couldn't wait.  <br/><br/>I'm going to start blending this into the noclue question as I move on here.  I think that aspect of mortality is something that adds to games.  Or failure.  A game is something with an indeterminate outcome.  It may be fun to hear/watch an exciting story, and wonder how the hero overcomes challenges, knowing that they're ok, but wondering how it's all going to play out.  But if I know the ending to my story I get this sense of drudgery when I get to an obstacle.  I know that if I fail to succeed there will just be another opportunity to make up for it  shortly.  It may cost me more, but the ultimate 'the end' is already written.  We're just filling in precut pieces to determine the route.<br/><br/>Between the two experiences, I'll take the risk.<br/><br/>Now, like I was just saying, about Indy.  Are his movies boring?  No.  Tense, not in the least.  But as much as I try to take the intellectual route, it's fun to watch things blow up.  I like pillaging it for ideas for me to try and use in my own gaming.  Situations that might come up.  But then, Indy isn't something I keep coming back to.  I'll watch it from time to time, to get ideas, hear my favorite lines again, and relive some of the days I used to pretend I was him.  The reality is, can you watch Indy every week for years?  The answer is no.  If this was a serial it would get boring.  <br/><br/>But gaming is something you keep coming back to. Weekly, monthly (some dorms daily). Leaving the possibility of real failure out of the mix is disheartening, and ultimately will become borring.  "There is much to be said for failure.  It is more interesting than success." - Max Beerbohm, 1946<br/><br/>I'm going to do a quick sum up of what I'm hearing so far in the thread, and maybe people can see why I'm still confused.<br/><br/>- It's bad for the GM to be god and railroad the players.  (I agree btw.)<br/>- It's ok to use bribes/compels to further the story.<br/><br/>- It's ok to let mechanics determine the character's personal changes.<br/>- It's not ok to let mechanics determine if they live or die.<br/><br/>- You get more control over your character through mechanics.<br/>- Other people can influence your character through mechanics.<br/><br/>- My character may change at a time when I don't want him to.<br/>- I get to say how he changes, but only within the spirit of the change.  So, it's really something I want him to do, and I'm happy about it.<br/><br/>- A new layer of rules has been added in a place that didn't have them before.<br/>- These mechanics speed up something that was run without mechanics before.<br/><br/>Really, it comes down to that 'I need to play it' thing.  Which will be happening soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96347/#Comment_96347" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T13:00:07+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  1:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 1:03PM by Consonant Dude.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>Rarely, if ever, is the situation calling for the die roll random.

Death as a main stake is fun for <i>some </i>game. I will add: it's great for <i>some </i>people. <br/><br/>I am not yet very familiar with the Story-Games forum so I don't want to talk for anybody but myself. But what I see is that this discussion is threatening to become circular with the Indy thing. You've got people describing how certain mechanics will produce the "Indy feel" they got at the movies and others describing a different "feel". Nobody in this thread is "wrong". <br/><br/>It's perfectly ok if what you want to play is "Indy, with the added incidence of death". You just have to know that depending on the conditions (system used), what your system will reward and "penalize" will dictate how close or not you are to the original rash vibe of the movies.<br/><br/>Lethality is just a knob. You can turn it all the way up or down. It simply one of many knobs that dictate (along with the actual players and GM's imagination) tone and genre. <br/><br/>Some people will be wanting a feel that they feel is closer to Indy. In fact, no matter if they like story games or traditional games, they might not even all agree on what exactly IS the Indy feel. And that's regardless of their views on roleplaying. As <i>moviegoers</i>, they might not even agree. Some people will not even care what the movies felt like, they want a different experience. <br/><br/>So basically, it boils down to this: you pick mechanics that reinforce what you (the roleplaying group) want the game to feel like. Just be aware that this choice does color what happens in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96362/#Comment_96362" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T14:06:15+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  2:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Consonant Dude</cite>So basically, it boils down to this: you pick mechanics that reinforce what you (the roleplaying group) want the game to feel like.

Sorry you die.  Then, no, that sucks.</blockquote>\nHopefully, nobody's game is that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The point is that, depending on what the group wants out of the game, even dying due to, e.g, trying to jump an unreasonable distance across a chasm could be totally unreasonable. What if the game is about, "What are the characters willing to sacrifice in order to get what they want?" If there's a reasonable chance that my PC might get killed before I can address that question to my satisfaction, how is that fun for me? I'm not interested in seeing whether my PC will die. I know he's going to live; what I don't know (yet) is what he's willing to do in order remain so. There's tons of tension to be had there.<br/><br/>The game that you described sounds like tremendous fun. My D&amp;D games are pretty much like that (I try, at least). They work because the question of whether the PCs will survive the threats I'm throwing at them <i>are the whole point</i>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>- It's bad for the GM to be god and railroad the players.  (I agree btw.)<br/>- It's ok to use bribes/compels to further the story.</blockquote>\nYes, given a robust system like Aspects in SotC. And, please note, the GM using a compel is <i>not</i> guiding the story away from what the players want towards what he wants, i.e., some ultimate end-goal. He's throwing complications at the players <i>as per their request</i>. Remember, the players are the ones who chose their Aspects.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>- It's ok to let mechanics determine the character's personal changes.<br/>- It's not ok to let mechanics determine if they live or die.</blockquote>\nNo, I'm saying it's contextual. The answer depends on the game in question and its goals.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>- You get more control over your character through mechanics.<br/>- Other people can influence your character through mechanics.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure how to address this one. Players in an RPG like SotC have more control in general over what can happen in the game, because the rules divvy up GM and player narrative power differently than, say, D&amp;D or HERO. The "influence" Aspects allow for isn't really any different from Disads in HERO guiding how the player or GM will adjudicate the PC, save for the fact that Aspects formalize the process and make things more democratic, as it were.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>- My character may change at a time when I don't want him to.<br/>- I get to say how he changes, but only within the spirit of the change.  So, it's really something I want him to do, and I'm happy about it.</blockquote>\nThis, I think, just goes back to what's been said about risk. The key is simply all the participants being aware of what's at stake and agreeing, when necessary, to use some formalized resolution method.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>- A new layer of rules has been added in a place that didn't have them before.<br/>- These mechanics speed up something that was run without mechanics before.</blockquote>\nYes, actually. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Freeform resolution can be notoriously tedious, because the lack of a process with a defined end-point can lead to endless back-and-forth. I mean, look at a non-game example like Robert's Rules of Order. Anybody can have a debate. Having an efficient debate with a decisive conclusion, otoh, takes either rules, or brute force. IMO, the latter does not consistently lead to satisfaction for everyone.<br/><br/>Remember, you don't whip out resolution mechanics every time a PC opens their mouth. You use them where there's a <i>conflict</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96364/#Comment_96364" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T14:10:57+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  2:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 2:30PM by Grimm.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude,<br/><br/>Wrong wrong wrong.<br/><br/>Ok, not really.  I just wanted to do that, and you seemed like a good enough sport. <br/><br/>Besides you edited while i was trying to post this, so I lost it the first time...  <br/><br/>... but you did answer a lot of the things I was going to say.  So... there you go.<br/><br/>I don't think I"m trying to sell anyone on right or wrong.  I'm a firm believer that each table needs to fine tune everything for themselves.  I'm wholly against system evangelism.  One size does not fit all.  If you don't like something, don't use it.  If you don't like Indy, that's fine.  I'll meet you out back later, and we'll have a chat about it, but it's fine.<br/><br/>But, I'm hearing how this style fixes things broken with RP.  I have to scratch my head and say... WHAT?  I'm still chalking it up to not understanding some part of the rules. <br/><br/>Anyway, the thread does run the risk of circular every time we hit an 'example'.  I can point out where RP would handle it, you can point out where a story based game would handle it.  That's why, instead, I just posted the inconsistencies  I'm hearing from the thread.<br/><br/>My final clarification with the buzz question though.  If you enter a dangerous situation, and something happens that requires a dice roll to save your butt, then it's not the dice that killed your character.  You did.  Whether you like that style of play, or not, don't suggest that the dice kill characters.  Players kill characters.  Occasionally, bad GM's kill characters.  So the example given, Indy and Winnie, is flawed.<br/><br/>*EDIT*<br/><br/>GAH!  You people and your posts.  Ok, let me read buzz's.<br/><br/>*EDIT EDIT*<br/><br/>Ok, now that I've read Buzz's.<br/><br/>In actuality, my D&amp;D games are 'rarely' about the threat of life and death.  I thought that story formed a good frame for your example though.  They're usually about dealing with the locals.  They go on adventures when they get itchy, but the high adventure creeps into the picture as the players go looking for it.<br/><br/>One of the points I was trying to make, what feels oh so long ago now, in my podcast, is that people seem to treat D&amp;D like it's a board game, and not really built for RP.  It's open endedness does not preclude RP.  Adding rules that force it seems odd to me.<br/><br/>The rest of your answers are really helpful.  The only one I still need some clarification is the last one.<br/><br/>Who says we need a resolution quickly?  Sometimes moving on while the tension and conflict remain is ok.  When I hit such snags in my own game, I just ask each player:  "Out of Character, are either of you going to budge on this right now?"  If the answer is "No."  Response is "Ok.  Then, we need to make a decision on how to get back on with the game."  Usually a quick compromise comes out of both players, because they realize they're holding up 6 other people's game.  And those people are friends, who they'll have to see at the next game, so their feelings matter.<br/><br/>Also, one of the comments I wrote for Mick over on my own board is that these social situations that don't always resolve out quickly, or easily, have made me a better person.  It was a chance to practice in a sand box, skills I use in real life.  I'm better with people because I game.  I worry at the loss of that by letting the dice force the compromise.  Forcing the social situation isn't a luxury we get in real life.  Working through the problem can be healthy for the person, and if the game slows for a little bit to do so, is that really so bad?<br/><br/>Finally, if you have a problem player, who just doesn't want to do that, are you really fixing the source or the symptom by patching it with rules.?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96416/#Comment_96416" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T19:55:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  7:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>Then you CHOSE to take the chance.

At first I thought "no, not really".<br/><br/>Then I thought about it, and it's not really all that different than the way I already generally play.<br/><br/>I've made a bit of a point of stating how I find having a bona fide chance of characters biting. But that's generally not always true. There's no real chance that a character will die in one of my games until a crucial scene. Sort of parallel to the "gripping final scene", or looked at another way, my way of living up to noclue's "is it cool?" criteria.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96424/#Comment_96424" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T20:24:22+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  8:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite><br/>- It's ok to let mechanics determine the character's personal changes.<br/>- It's not ok to let mechanics determine if they live or die.</blockquote>\nI felt I could say something useful on this one.<br/><br/>Death is a personal change as well, and the same type of system would apply.

You could have an opening phase where things are just getting established. Everything's nice and safe. Then you move into the middle game where some resource is passing back and forth and impacting the timer. The characters may have to choose between there ever dwindling domesday resource and the things they want. The end is getting nearer and they are bringing it closer. When the time runs out, everything goes into endgame and character death is on the table.<br/><br/>Why does this feel like <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> and the clock that strikes 13?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96440/#Comment_96440" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T21:38:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  9:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Would you play a game where you could see the character's timer? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nThey made that game.  It's called Call of Cthuhlu.<br/><br/>Seriously, I've actually run a game in reverse.  I like time travel in my games, so when I can work it in I do.  In this one case, they had the whole series of events out of order, the first scene was everything going wrong, and the space station exploding.  Then they got bounced around trying to avoid the catastrophe.  They knew that they had 2 hours to undo whatever they did wrong, but weren't 100% sure, what 'wrong' was.<br/><br/>This was back when I wrote the story for my games, and didn't just let the players run with the setting.<br/><br/>As for knowing my character's timer.  Probably.  It could be really cool.  Does he flail uselessly against the hand fate delt him?  Or run like a daredevil doing impossible things (Movie:  Groundhog day).  It makes me think of that Will Ferrel movie, Stranger Than Fiction...<br/><br/>The choice thing noclue, is in response to people continually saying that they like social rules because it keeps something as arbitrary as a dice roll from killing the player. (the example used previously was Winnie &amp; Indy)  Fail your save, die.  But with the fate points, they feel like they have an out.  A way to bypass the problem.  This was one of the things I heard in several places that led to a lot of my misconceptions.  It sort of got me started thinking it's not a good thing for players to have TOO much control of the story.  It may not be the designer intent, but it's a mechanical quirk in the system that some people seem to be using.<br/><br/>Ludanto, I brought that up because I hear things like "It's bad to let Winnie make a will save (mechanic) to determine if Indy lives or dies" (again flawed analogy, but anyway).  But it's ok, to have a mechanic to determine if my character undergoes a personality, understanding shift.  It seems disconnected to me, since I'd rather have a mechanic deal with combat, since we don't' actually act that out, and control my character's with a more hands on approach.  Either way, the style I came to the table to play has shifted.  Again, I'm told I'm missing it here, so I"m just putting out my current perception.  It's subject to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96451/#Comment_96451" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T23:10:15+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 11:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite><br/>- It's ok to let mechanics determine the character's personal changes.<br/>- It's not ok to let mechanics determine if they live or die.<br/></blockquote>\nMy view: both are ok if the players involved are ok with it.

Sometimes moving on while the tension and conflict remain is ok.  When I hit such snags in my own game, I just ask each player:  "Out of Character, are either of you going to budge on this right now?"  If the answer is "No."  Response is "Ok.  Then, we need to make a decision on how to get back on with the game."  Usually a quick compromise comes out of both players, because they realize they're holding up 6 other people's game.  And those people are friends, who they'll have to see at the next game, so their feelings matter.</blockquote>\nNo one says you need a resolution quickly all the time. If everyone is having fun, then you roll with it. My point is that not everyone makes the smart move you do to break character and ask the players what can be done so the group can move on. It can also be useful to have a mechanical solution to reach a resolution, especially when players aren't as happy with compromise or let their own egos get in the way. It can also be very appealing to have a method of resolution that's not all fiat/negotiation. It's also fun to have a method that produces results that may surprise the group and drive play in unexpected directions.<br/><br/>It's not that conflict resolution for social scenes is inherently better\xe2\u20ac\u201dthough I honestly prefer it. I think a big gist of this thread is critiquing the idea that it's inherently <i>inferior</i>, which is something I see said all the time by people who, at most, have seen the lousy way, e.g., D&amp;D does it.<br/><br/>Me, I'm all about popping a cap in the ass of the "role/roll" mindset and dumping its body in the East River. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20"

And I think it's really awesome that your players knew that you were willing to kill their characters if that's what the dice said.  What I have found in practice with many game groups, however, is that character death is the one place where GMs are <i>most likely</i> to fudge the rules.  And, while I am anti-fudging, it's very understandable why this practice arose:  because gamers are often interested in their characters' story arcs, and oftentimes dying just felt inappropriate, even if that's what the dice said.

Whatever evil overlord is still trying to take over the world, doesn't mean he's done just because a character died.  The story arc changed (slightly) but it's still intact.  If the whole party dies... well, that might be the end of a story arc.  But if you have that happening often, without the players screwing up, then you need to look at the lethality of your campaign.<br/><br/>I think fudging the rules when it came to death arose more because, they're your friends.  And killing their character makes them sad.  And you don't want to be the one who makes them sad.  I haven't fudged a die roll in 10 years.  It was hard at first to break myself of the habit.  To let the crits happen.  At first, I got a reputation as an evil GM.  They still joke about it today.  People who come into our group take a second (or more) of adjustment, but they learn to like it.  And to date, everyone's been happier for it.  It's still sad to see a character go down.  To know that a perspective of the story just went away.  But a brief period of mourning, both in and out of story, and we pick up a character, who changes the story again in fun and unexpected ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96849/#Comment_96849" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T08:08:44+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  8:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2007 8:10AM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To take this in a slightly new direction:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">With that constant safety net, do you ever find yourself doing crazy things because you know you're safe?

In the campaign I played it allowed me to play a character that would never, never have worked in a traditional system.  Specifically, this guy:<br/>\n<img alt="534783743_7e2d413d6b.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1343/534783743_7e2d413d6b.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nHis schtick was that he was a Plane Rustler.  That means, he would find planes <i>as they were flying</i>, rope 'em, climb aboard, and hijack them.  He didn't have any special powers that allowed him to do this, except that he was great with a lasso.  One of his main aspects was "Leap before you look".   His classic move was to blindly jump off of the wing of an airplane without a chute, hoping to randomly find another plane, skyscraper, flagpole, or large bird to lasso and break his deadly fall.  It was a hilarious and delightful character, and the only thing that made it possible was my ability to throw aspects into the world to save my blindly jumping ass (things like haystack trucks that happen to be passing).  In a traditional game, this fun character would have been dead within the first fifteen minutes of gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96857/#Comment_96857" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T08:32:45+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  8:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...<br><br><b>Awesome</b>.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96864/#Comment_96864" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T08:56:19+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  8:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a lot to say about character death, but that might be worth its own thread. For example, any comparisons to shows/novels where main characters die are somewhat flawed because it usually reduces the number of main characters. You can't bring in new characters in the middle of Lost and make them main characters. You can see how that goes with Anna-Lucia.<br><br>When character death happens in an RPG, you have to bring in a new character. This new one doesn't have the same connections to the group, is necessarily an outsider, has not shared the adventure so far, and so on. Unless you turn an already-existing NPC into a PC, but that curtails the authorship of the player.<br/><br/>I don't mind character death when it's meaningful. But even in Lost the main characters don't just die because they fail to jump over a chasm or because a random encounter with a jungle creature kills them. That's exactly how it goes in a lot of RPGs, though. In AD&amp;D 2e, my gnome illusionist once almost died because, while sneaking up on the enemy lair, he failed a climb roll and fell off the side of a hill, taking 2 points of damage (he only had 3 HP).

In a giveable conflict, this is true. The player can decide to give rather than take massive fall-out and generally avoid death. That way, death is not on the table for trivial conflicts. However, if the stakes are "does my character kill your character" then death has definitely just been put on the table without any specific player agreement about it. That of course, is not an trivial conflict.<br/><br/>Similarly, in SOTC if the GM wants to have a BIG conflict where death is an option, the GM can start spending his fate points. The character spends his fate points and tags any aspects available to avoid death and you have a massive battle between the contestants with fate points flying. Which is a extremely cool. As opposed to fudging a climb wall roll and having your pulp action star crumpled at the bottom of a cliff, which is teh suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97057/#Comment_97057" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T00:24:54+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 12:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In DitV, all stakes are subject to approval by the group.

And they settle on what wounding looks like and the conflict is on. <br/><br/>Cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97201/#Comment_97201" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T11:33:11+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 11:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2007 11:36AM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to commend the following <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4313&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">example of stakes setting in DitV</a> as an awesome example of the power of stakes setting to push a particular story the group wants to tell at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97209/#Comment_97209" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T12:09:38+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 12:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I wound you" isn't the greatest stake ever.

But I was thinking in the narrow case where one player was trying to kill the other player and how character death was mitigated by stakes setting in that instance. Frex, we're doing the steward repents conflict and he escalates to guns and rolls big. You decide its not worth the fallout and give. So the steward doesn't repent. Now, what if there's a follow on conflict? The angry steward tries to shoot you. Its not about repentance anymore. Its about he's pissed off and trying to kill you. I'm not really suggesting that this is the best stakes ever, just investigating how Dogs handles various stakes.

It would be a far more interesting conflict if the stakes were deeper and more about the characters: \n<ul>Say that the Steward wants to prove he is more righteous than the Dog who confronted him and is going to put him down for the arrogance of being contrary. </ul>\n<ul>Maybe the Steward's pride has been wounded in front of the gathered villagers and now he needs to regain it and his standing in front of those neighbors. </ul>\nI think it plays into the thread as it shows different stakes that can be as interesting or even more interesting than death. You can have scenarios where your character's beliefs and deeply held morals are on the line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97412/#Comment_97412" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T20:58:27+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  8:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2007 9:06PM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent has an example in his text where someone sneaks up on a sleeping dog with an axe and hits them in the head.<br/><br/>The stakes may not be as deep, but sometimes folks just up and want to kill you. I'm hesitant to say "No, it can't be that he wants to kill you. He *must* have a deeper desire first. Then he can try to kill you to get that." This is especially true when "he is trying to kill you" is such a simple, commonplace desire that happens all over the world on a daily basis. A whole game of simple stakes might be pretty boring, but a variety of stakes can keep things fresh too. The game seems adequate to handle simple stakes as well as complex stakes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97416/#Comment_97416" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T22:10:36+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 10:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, that's a good point, James.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4161/grimm-comments-on-spirit-of-the-century/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4161/grimm-comments-on-spirit-of-the-century">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4161/grimm-comments-on-spirit-of-the-century/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4161/grimm-comments-on-spirit-of-the-century/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4161/grimm-comments-on-spirit-of-the-century/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4161%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4161%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
