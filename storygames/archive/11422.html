I'm even making them brush their teeth. Even though we don't have much toothpaste left. But those tubes last a long time. <br/><br/>Yes I am writing this with a pencil. It's a long story. <br/><br/>Three days ago we walked over to the Dales house for dinner. They had a pig they had killed, and even after smoking most of it, they had a lot leftover. They were kind enough to ask us to join them. Honestly, it was the best meal we'd had in about a month. <br/><br/>In the middle of dinner Mr. Mason came to the door and he was in a panic. He said his daughter was sick - she was burning up. I left the kids with the Dales and Mike and I ran over with Mr. Mason. He was right, she was burning up. I could feel the heat coming off Stacy's body. She was really sick, like with the flu - she kept coughing up mucus. We bundled her up and we all pulled a landscaping cart into town. <br/><br/>We made the clinic in about 4 hours. I've never worked so hard in my life. I guess it was good we ate so well. I burned all that pig off, I think. Anyways, Mrs. Banks was there and woke up Lindsay so she could take a look. Mike and I rested while Mr. Mason tried to explain the problems his daughter was having. I think I heard pneumonia and it was probably bacterial. Lindsay didn't have anything stronger than amoxicillin, which she came by from the vets office. She was young and probably would be OK.<br/><br/>Mrs. Banks looked worse than I did and I asked her when was the last time she ate. She tried to wave me off, but I insisted. She may have taught grade school, and likes to be a martyr for the kids, but she's no good if she's wasting away. I gave her some hard boiled eggs. I made her promise to eat them, but she pocketed them for later.<br/><br/>George insisted that he would wait in town. Mike and I slept until dawn and then walked back without the cart. By the time I made it to the house, I was very dizzy and exhausted. The kids did a great job bringing in some firewood and we made some tea. I think Daniella was scared. I promised them both that Stacy would be fine, that Lindsay was very smart and we still had some medicine. Luke wanted to give the clinic the Tylenol we had and I didn't say anything but that if she needed it, I'd make sure she got it.<br/><br/>Yesterday I walked into town with the kids. We stopped by Mrs. Banks place, which was a little out of the way, but the day was unusually mild and the kids like her dogs, as you recall. Mrs. Banks was there and we talked about the clinic. She asked me to help with a jar in the kitchen while the kids played in the yard. She made sure they couldn't hear - Stacy's fever had not gone down in 2 days. It was very serious. Lindsay mentioned something about her going "septic". It sounded very bad. Mrs. Banks then gave me several boxes of No. 2 pencils as she heard I was keeping a diary. The look on her face sort of made me think she was going to grade it for penmanship.<br/><br/>She insisted we eat lunch. I got really angry when she gave the kids some honey and cornbread - I am pretty sure that was the last jar. She saw the look on _my_ face and she patted my hand then Luke's head. <br/><br/>It was about the mid afternoon when we made it to the clinic. George was outside, staring up at the sky. Lindsay was about to come out when she saw me and I knew. Stacy died that morning. Stacy MASON, 14 years old.<br/><br/>I left some of the Tylenol with Lindsay. Someone will need it. I left George alone. I can't imagine what that's like. No, I can, but I don't want to even think about that. Daniella was mostly quiet, and Luke wouldn't stop talking about the .22 I promised to show him how to use.<br/><br/>I traded some of our old phone books to the store for some .22 rounds, and Jeff ran his shortwave. I pedaled for about an hour. We think we heard something in French about 3 o'clock. Nothing else.<br/><br/>We're going to stay with Jeff tonight. We pray every night for the day you come home.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254578/#Comment_254578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T16:08:40+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  4:08PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2010 4:11PM by James Jeffers.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Geneva;">Jenny,<br/><br/>I used to think I knew what hungry meant. I remember being a freshman at State, and not eating 3 squares at the end of a semester, before the financial aid checks would arrive for the next semester. That wasn't hunger. Not at all.<br/><br/>Is this what they mean by fasting? I've lost 12 lbs this month based on Jeff's scale. Yes, it's probably meant for horse feed, but it's a scale. I know you'd laugh hard at me, standing there on that scale.<br/><br/>Don't worry - I'm feeding the kids. I feed them everything, as much as I can, every day. Mr. Mason gave us some of the Ensure he kept around. He's not doing so good. He was going to say something, but I think he saw Daniella and he made a pretty fast exit. I didn't make him stay.<br/><br/>The kids - yeah, they are eating. No hamburgers or milk - but suddenly they have a taste for pickled peaches, which I found at Beth and Henry's house. No one's heard of them since they left town. They headed east, to St. Louis, I guess to get their son, who lived there. Most of the food in the fridge was long gone. But their cupboard was full of all the food they didn't carry - molasses and corn meal and jars full of preserves, pasta sauce, and yes, picked fruit. They didn't say it, but I think they wouldn't mind. I left an IOU.<br/><br/>Luke's been shooting at birds, whatever he sees. It's impossible to hit a bird with a rifle - we really need a shotgun, but pretty much no one's parting with theirs. Maybe we'll head to the woods and look for - shit, I almost wrote "dog" - I guess if it cooks we will eat it - I really mean a beaver, or a squirrel, or something that didn't respond to a name.<br/><br/>Two nights ago I was thrown from my bed by what I thought was lightning... but lighting doesn't stay lit for as long as this. And there was no sound. Just light. Like a flashlight from the roof. I opened the door, and looked up. I was almost blinded by another pulse. Something was going on. I could hear a shout across the road. George was shouting something. I didn't hear what - I was too busy trying to rub out the spots. <br/><br/>The next day we were in town and Jeff and talked about it. He thinks someone launched missiles at the satellites. I hope they nuked one of those fuckers because if they missed, the satellite will torch whoever did it. I counted at least 4 bursts. Jeff said they were very high - probably way above the atmosphere. Still, I can't help wondering - will we get radiation?<br/><br/>Oh, so Jeff and I also talked about possible keeping the kids in town. I'm not alone in thinking about weirdos or just plain desperate people crawling around here when I am outside, or out of sight. I keep the .22 with me at night, but who knows what people can do. Besides, the garden isn't making anything, and the kids need to be near some other kids. With Stacy gone, they are the only children in the neighborhood. Jeff said they were welcome to bunk in the Jazzercise studio over the store. I'll send them with whatever I have, plus some of the books we were going to sell. I never figured Jeff would go for Tor Sci-fi, but he needs something to sell. And I've read them all.<br/><br/>Mrs. Banks wanted me to say hello for her. She brought over a box of sweaters that her husband came back from the Army with. They really didn't fit me, but it will save me firewood at night. I insisted I do something for her and she asked me to clean a .45 (which I also assume her husband brought home from the Army). I cleaned it as best I could and tested it in the back. Seemed to be OK. She had about a dozen more rounds, so I loaded the magazines and showed her how to use the safety. I suggested that she also move into town, but she declined. I think she has been skipping meals again. She had to sit down every few minutes. I thought about offering her some of my food - but I knew she would say no.<br/><br/>The garden looks dead. I'm not a green thumb. But I'm damned good at splitting wood now. That book on gardening suggested a plastic cover to help keep heat. I'll look for some when I go to town with the kids. <br/><br/>I'm dead tired. Tomorrow is going to be a long, hard day. They all seem hard now. It's got to get better. It'd be better still if you were here.<br/><br/>We love you. We're praying for you.<br/><br/>P.S. I forgot to mention that 4 days ago Mitch REEDE died of a heart attack, Lindsay said he was 54 years old. I guess they'll have to find someone else to deliver the mail. Sorry, bad joke.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254862/#Comment_254862" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T16:43:25+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  4:43PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Geneva;">Jenny,<br/><br/>Let me write this all down. I don't want to forget anything.<br/><br/>There was a man, a stranger wandering through town. I think that in older days we would have written him off as a passing derelict. The sheriff would pick him up, maybe feed him and drop him off at Valstead with $5. But right now, we know the people who don't belong.<br/><br/>I've forgotten to say that Sheriff Tiles offered to retire and appoint Deputy Peron in his place. He said he was too old for riding horses and all that, preferred a heated cruiser, the job was for a younger man. No one wanted him to retire and the town council more or less refused his offer outright. They just wanted someone with law enforcement experience at the helm. Peron is practically the new sheriff and he's deputized "The Boys". <br/><br/>Someone saw the stranger looking into some of the houses on NW 2nd Street. It was a regular hue and cry, what with people shouting and more than a few weapons waved at him. Peron rode him down in the park. He gave up pretty quickly, seeing he was about to be shot to death.<br/><br/>Peron was rough with him - the man was Hispanic, but had a gut. How's that? What's a guy walking around in this place that fat? Peron locked him up and kept questioning him. He was convinced the guy was part of a gang. "Look at his tatoos" - they meant nothing to me. In the morning the sheriff cam in and he was pretty upset about it. He got to play Good Cop, apparently, with that guy. After awhile even the sheriff had enough. Peron kept pushing, asking where he had come from, what he wanted, where were his friends? and so on.<br/><br/>I was about to say something about this being torture when Jeff stopped me. "Let them work on him" he said and he didn't say too much more. I saw that Jeff was contemplating something and his hunches have been spot on lately. I didn't say anything.<br/><br/>By dinner the guy, who they now called Jose, was looking rough for wear. Lindsay bandaged him up but there was a lot of complaints about our medical supplies being used on Jose. Anyways, Peron was finally done and he said that Jose said he would take them to where his friends were, his gang. We all (yes, even me, with my .22) rode with Jose in the back of a Charles Bergmen's horse. They gagged Jose who was fairly freaked out. Peron insisted he just wanted to know who they were and to ask them to move along. <br/><br/>We made it to the Exxon on Highway 42, about a mile from the lake. Jose indicated his friends were around. Peron remembered a ravine with a beach that also had a conoe launch and grills, a perfect camping spot. We left Charles to watch Jose and we began to move to the ravine. <br/><br/>They were 4 men around a grill, cooking honest to god hot dogs. I wanted them so badly. I'm sure we all did. They had tents.\xa0And motorcycles. What were they using? They must have heard us, because one of them jumped up and pulled out what looked like the largest revolver I've ever seen. It looked like a movie prop. Pretty much everyone started yelling at once. One of the boy - probably Devon - had enough sense to shout in Spanish at them. Peron ducked back behind a tree and drew a bead on them. I was standing there, stunned, too afraid to move or say anything. I couldn't see Jeff, but I thought he was to my right.<br/><br/>I heard yelling and moving for the longest time. I'm sure it was seconds. But Peron finally lifted his rifle and showed his hand as if to say "We're not going to shoot". And that's when the shooting started.<br/><br/>I didn't hear the first shot, but one of the gang's chest exploded and then I heard the crack of a hunting rifle. Then more shots and I realized that the guy with the big pistol was shooting at me. I fell backwards onto Jeff then I realized he had pulled me down. He said nothing, but chambered a round into his rifle and sighted into the ravine. I closed my eyes. I wasn't processing it. I wasn't happening.<br/><br/>The rifle fire abated until Peron began to call out our names and yelling for us to stop. He looked sweaty and shaky. The ravine was covered in bodies.  Then we heard the cry. A baby's cry. And a woman crawled out of the tent. She was sobbing, very hysterical. She was dragging a small boy. The boy was red with blood. He did not move. <br/><br/>She screamed, and kept screaming, holding her baby and little boy. Jeff walked over and sit next to her. Devon was trying to explain, "Lo siento! Lo siento, por favor!" It made no difference. Collateral damage.<br/><br/>Jeff counted heads. Kenny DuPonte didn't answer to his name. We found him, about 20 yards from the ravine, where he'd crawled, bleeding badly. He couldn't speak, and was going into shock. Peron thought about bringing one of the bikes up, and he ran down to start it. He couldn't until Devon showed him how, but Kenny stopped breathing. <br/><br/>Peron dropped the rifle cartridge he was trying to load into his rifle. He said there might be more, etc. Jeff didn't look too concerned. He looked at the food. We all decided we should take everything back and get everything figured out. Whatever the fuck that means.<br/><br/>I asked who shot first, and some of them thought the "gang" shot first. When we got back to Charles, he had shot Jose dead. He said Jose began to become more agitated for some reason and tried to run away. Charles tried to club him, but "had" to shoot him as he ran into the woods. "It was him or us," he said. So, we shot first, as it turns out.<br/><br/>We took everything back, eventually. If there was anyone else, we never found him. We put the woman into the jail, but we didn't lock her up. It was probably the safest place. Lindsay said she was traumatized and tried to calm her down with a sedative. The sheriff had Peron write everything down and he asked me to do the same, and I'll show him this in a minute. <br/><br/>So, Kenny DUPONTE, 20, who you may remember as the kid who set fire to his parent's minivan on Halloween? I guess he didn't need to die. But Peron wants us to bury him as a hero.<br/><br/>The woman's name is Malinal, her boy was Lois, her baby is a girl name Norma, and her husband was Jose.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255115/#Comment_255115" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T19:07:05+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  7:07PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Geneva;">Jenny,<br/><br/>I'm not sure about anything anymore. Every day it gets darker, harder.<br/><br/>On Sunday a group of people from Olmerville showed up with some corn, for which we traded some of the canned food we had in Jeff's store. We swapped stories and they had a pretty creepy one. <br/><br/>On the previous Friday they had to turn back a crowd of about 50 or so people, some of who claimed they had walked from Kansas City. They looked terrible like the pictures from the Third World where people pack up their house on their back and get out of Dodge, or so the Olmers said. We asked what they did for them, and they sort of got defensive. We didn't want to fight, so we just let it go.<br/><br/>Where these people went I don't know. We've doubled up on the patrols to the north and south, keeping an eye on the trailer park and apartments off the highway. Someone could easily squat in there and we wouldn't know for days. Better to keep them from getting comfortable. <br/><br/>Before they left, one of Olmers, a woman, she pulled me aside and said "They had no kids with them. Isn't something wrong with that?" I didn't know what she meant, but when I saw the kids today, I suddenly got to what she was saying. How or why would you leave your children in this world? Or, maybe, they were already dead, or the people with kids wouldn't leave them and stayed wherever people were running from.<br/><br/>Linda Havers came into Jeff's place today and overheard Jeff and I talking about all the stuff we missed, and so on. She spoke up and said she didn't miss the TV, or the radio, and enjoyed growing her own food. She also said that the earth was healing itself after we had raped it for so long. She said it's much better now that people weren't polluting nature. She said the satellite were doing us all a favor. I just wish I had seen Mr. Mason before he hit her with that bottle.<br/><br/>We locked George up and Lindsay had to stitch Linda's head.<br/><br/>Malinal stopped screaming and crying, and now she's mostly quiet. She keeps to her "room" and Lindsay and Devon try to get her to speak. I can't say I blame Malinal.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the kids - they are doing fine, and I'm thinking of moving into the studio over the store. I don't think there's anything left of the house I want to move into town. I haven't seen Mitts in several weeks. Luke stopped asking where he went, too. I miss them, they miss you. This is better, I think. I think Jeff is happy for the company.<br/><br/>I didn't see Mrs. Banks today, which is a shame because I was going to ask her to tutor the kids, and I had this plan for overpaying her some of the eggs I earned splitting wood and other odd jobs.<br/><br/>P.S. (evening) Large amount of smoke east of town, like a large fire. The smoke is black. Jeff thinks its Olmersville. Some of us are going to head over there in the morning and see what's up. They may need our help. Peron is rounding up the boys.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255275/#Comment_255275" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T18:49:41+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  6:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Geneva;">Jenny,<br/><br/>I've been asleep for a whole day. But, I want to get this on paper. I don't want to remember, but it's important.<br/><br/>Peron and the rest of us took off on the bikes and horses towards Olmersville. We passed a couple of people walking back toward us on Rte. 1334, just under the railroad track, and they were taking a minute from the rain. It was Clive and Mara Pederson. <br/><br/>As much as I wanted to hear everything that had happened to them and their town, we had to know what was happening. I saw their faces lighten when they recognized me. It was like they hadn't smiled in a long time, and they weren't sure how to do it.<br/><br/>The said that the day before a group of people camped another 5 miles down on the highway, about 100 or so people. They heard this from some people who had fled back into town from their places. The crowd was tearing up everything - trees for wood, fuel from abandoned vehicles like a colony of ants. In the worse case they began to steal from the farms. When warning shots only delayed them, the wise got packing. Some of the houses they broke into they set fire to after taking what they wanted.<br/><br/>Some of the Olmersville men organized themselves and rode back out to the highway. They told the mob that as long as they stayed out of town, and keep moving they would leave them alone. Everyone was armed. Apparently, so were people in this mob. It got clear pretty fast they thought they could just take what they wanted. <br/><br/>Someone threw a Molotov at the Olmers and they fired at the crowd. The crowd shot back and hell broke loose. Only a few men came back on horses about to collapse from being ridden so hard. <br/><br/>The rest of Olmersville was getting ready to fight with what they had. The Pedersons lived just off Main and 12th, and felt too exposed. Clive's aunt lives on the other side of Valstead, and that's where they were headed. They hadn't bothered to pack much, maybe they thought it would slow them down. We kept moving.<br/><br/>Just as we passed the bridge at Little Creek, someone from the houses shot at us! Peron waved a handkerchief and tried to identify us as friends. It was just a scared picket, probably no older than Luke, who was trying to watch the bridge. <br/><br/>We talked to the mayor and to the "militia" they were organizing. We offered to help patrol and defend until the mob was gone. They were happy for the assistance and when they offered to pay us, we refused, which I think hurt their pride. But honestly, they looked as hungry as we did. <br/><br/>Jeff suggested that we get a good idea of what the mob was doing. But the mob was not a single beast. They had dispersed into small groups, and they were looting all the homes up to the highway past the post office as far as we could tell. Devon shot at one of them, but even Peron chewed him out. "They're just hungry!" he said, which coming from Peron was surprising. But the Olmers were less forgiving. They caught 2 men who were busy ransacking a home, and they shot them "in self defense."<br/><br/>The rest of the day was like that. We could ride back and forth in a group and try and scare the looters off. We would hear a shot. We'd ride over, trying to catch them. Someone tried to shoot at us, but we never did see them. By that night, the Olmers had killed 5 people. One of the people was a kid, with a dirty Mizzou jacket. He was like a scarecrow, no shoes, just this piece of rebar in his hand as they dragged his body back on the road for burning. <br/><br/>The mayor pulled us into town and made us sleep while another group of Olmers took over. They had a room of cots and blankets in the library. I don't remember anything past that. Sleep came like a dark ocean that I swam into.<br/><br/>I woke up some time later. I could hear people shouting at each other. Hateful, loud yelling. I stumbled out of the cot and into the street. The mayor was rubbing her face and her hair, and a few of the Olmers from earlier in the day stood over a group of bodies in the street. <br/><br/>It took me moment to recognize that the bodies were not corpses, just  prostrate refugees. They had put bags or sacks on their heads. Some had zip ties on their wrists. The Olmers had them a gunpoint and they had hard faces. <br/><br/>One of the Olmers, I want to call him "Hank" was screaming at the mayor. The mayor was trying to calm him. "They're just woman and children." "They're trying to steal our food! It's us or them!" "Some of them are kids-" "Kids we can't feed! What about my kids? What are they going to eat?"<br/><br/>While this was going on, I saw one of the refugees trying to comfort a little boy, who was wide eyed with terror. He would gulp, and then cough and his momma (?) would whisper "sssshhh" to him. I thought I'd seen the worse. This was it. This was all I could take.<br/><br/>I woke up Jeff. He saw me in the light of the candle. He walked up to the door and watched. His eyes went to wherever he goes or was, some place far away. After a minute I saw his jaw click, and his eyes close. And came back in. He rummaged into his bag and drew a flask. "Drink this." It was hot - not like soup but like rubbing alcohol. It worked, I just wanted to close my eyes. I did.<br/><br/>Jeff roused me the next morning. The mob had moved on, for the most part. Another Olmer had been killed. He was knifed and bled to death. They said they killed more of the mob, but they didn't have a body count. <br/><br/>The refugees in the street were gone. The mayor got Hank to allow people to give what they wanted, and some people did give them some clothes, and some containers for food and water, but very few actually gave food. The mayor asked them to keep moving to the state park, and there someone would guard them until the mob was moved further along. <br/><br/>We rested that day and spent them time sorting through the news that the Olmers had. Chicago has still standing, but basically abandoned - maybe a city on Lake Michigan without power sucks in winter? St. Louis had some sort of martial law, and the army was using horses to get around. Denver was mostly there, but suffering like Chicago. I55 was a river of humanity headed south. All rumor, maybe true maybe not. No one seemed to know anything substantial about the satellites. Most everyone remembered the flashes in the sky, and the consensus was that someone tried to knock one or more the satellite out. Your tax dollars at work!<br/><br/>In the evening we headed back. Lindsay saw to our scrapes and bruises, but we escaped most harm. The kids told me that Mrs. Banks had come by and dropped off some more clothes and some books. I was pretty encouraged - the books were algebra and english lit, social sciences and what not. The basics of a solid education. I have to remember to get out to her house, and convince her to move into the studio. The kids would like that.<br/><br/>We all passed out and slept for the day. I'm just now catching up with the kids. They are playing in the street and I'm catching up in the diary, obviously. Mrs. Nassau is going to convene the town council tonight and we're going to discuss how to handle any more refugees. I'm not sure there's anything we can do, really.<br/><br/>I haven't admitted this to myself, but I need to face reality. Jenny, I love you with all my heart. I've held out hope for so long it hurts. I've hoped and prayed you made the flight out of Boston. That you crashed in Ohio or Iowa or where ever and you just had to walk home. I've seen what's happening out there. I know you, and if there was a way you'd be here. But I'm just lying to the kids and me. <br/><br/>I'm going to explain to the kids that you are dead. I'm sorry, but I know you'll understand. Please forgive me.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255299/#Comment_255299" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T06:11:10+00:00" title="February  6, 2010  6:11AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Geneva;"><br/>Not much time to write this. We're scouting south towards the river, going to try and convince some of the folks to move into town. We're down a man. Devon collapsed and was sweating badly. Kid was trying to act tough, but hadn't eaten this morning. I gave him a word or two and helped him to the clinic. Luckily, I got to carry his Mini14 instead of the .22.<br/><br/>Mrs. Banks stopped by with more books, paper, and so on. Luke isn't happy about the school part, but I think Daniella enjoys learning. There's only so much a girl her age can do in this town. The books are an escape. Oh, also, caught a racoon and we had a nice stew. Shared it with Jeff for some goats milk, which was delicious.<br/></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255330/#Comment_255330" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T15:28:28+00:00" title="February  6, 2010  3:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Geneva;">Returned to a town meeting where people were discussing how to conserve what food we had. It's clear that the winter wheat seed is not going to be enough. The good news is that we won't have to wait until they harvest before plowing another crop. The bad news is that of course, it will be months before another large yield is ready. No one has asked that anyone commit food to a community reserve. But folks have been generous in trade - labor for eggs, eggs for meat, meat for fish or canned food, and so on. The economy of this barter system is shrinking because the supplies are running low. Folks are thinking ahead and finally fear is overtaking us.<br/><br/>I think the town has about a week of food (eating as we do now). Families will either have to kill what chickens they have or go without. <br/><br/>I was hungry as hell tonight. I've been riding all day. The horses have fodder - I'd eat grass too if I thought it would help. Daniella and Luke ate the last of the eggs I had and some of the dandelions we picked beside the church, which I didn't mind. They need the calories more than I do. Luke is so skinny. <br/><br/>I've never been in better shape - I'm weighing in at 168 - which I haven't seen since I was in college. It's the dizzy spells that I could do without. Maybe I'm just dehydrated. I'm going back out to the house tomorrow morning to look for anything. If I see a rabbit or a bird I'll eat it right then. Mrs. Banks asked me to come by the house tomorrow and pick a box of supplies she left. She and George Mason walked back an hour ago.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255331/#Comment_255331" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T15:31:34+00:00" title="February  6, 2010  3:31PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Geneva;">Luke's shoes are about gone.

Devon has it. Lindsay is pretty freaked out. She hasn't told anyone but Jeff and I and Devon's sister. She's put in in the office, away from anyone else. She looked up the symptoms, and it's only an educated guess, but the breathing problems, the blood in his cough - it all adds up to plague. We have no antibiotics of any kind. We have no idea if anyone does. <br/><br/>Lindsay also stressed that until we know for certain, which may be we'll have to wait until Devon gets better or dies, we have to assume it is and stay away from each other.
