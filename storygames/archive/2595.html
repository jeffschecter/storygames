She described the earlier as more "dark, pagany" and the one we were watching as more "fun, actiony".  Or some such.<br/><br/>The two ideas started to wrestle in my head and I had this urge to run a game that allowed Crusades-trained Action Heroes and magic-weilding Druids to work together to overthrow the injustice in England. (My wide looked skeptical - but she's a bit of a purist in that mind space.) By the end of the first episode of Robin Hood, I imagined characters who were experts in different weapons and/or skills - the Archer, the Swordsman, etc.<br/><br/>Then, I saw <a href="http://www.roninarts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=65" rel="nofollow">this thread </a> this thread from the Ronin Arts Forums. Basically, Iago is going to do a mash-up of the Fate system with FASERIP.  Now I realize the open nature of both games makes this a natural, but it got me thinking about what other systems would mash nicely with Fate.<br/><br/>Peering at my shelves of games and rolling all this around in my head, I got enamoured of mashing Fate with Feng Shui to run this game.  Take the ideas of templates, tweak for the setting, add the idea of aspects (invoke an Aspect to reroll, get a +2, etc.).  That's as far as I've gotten, but it feels somehow persuable.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I particularly like the quick-start feel of templates from Feng Shui and the built in balance of making a particular template the BEST at what it is they do.  (It actually feels similar to SotC skills pyramid in that sense.)  I will be watching what Phil and Fred do myself - I like SotC's character creation method and will need to put some thought into how to apply to the Template process....<br/><br/>Anyway, I wanted to share and to capture these ideas somewhere (as my thumb drive has gone missing).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
