Both of those are free PDFs/RPGs. I recently ran them and enjoyed their high-pace combat that felt like a fighting game / action movie sequence. I'm curious if anything else has been done with the mechanic, or if there are any similar RPGs? I'm aware of the old Street-Fighter Game and Burn Legend, which is based off of it, but was never quite as sold on those for some reason.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410630/#Comment_410630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T18:28:54+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  6:28PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mechanic reminds me of <i>Hollowpoint</i>. You start a round by rolling a pool of dice, and any dice which match form "sets" that can be spent for effect. Action starts with the longest set, and you can spend a set to cancel out an opponent's die (possibly spoiling their set) or damage an opponent who doesn't have any sets left. It's very fast-paced and actiony.<br/><br/><i>Example: Bruce has 4 dice in his pool, and rolls 1, 2, 2, 4. Jaci has 5 dice in her pool, and rolls 3, 3, 3, 4, 6. Jaci goes first, and spends her 3's to knock out Bruce's 2's.</i><br/><br/>One big wrinkle: characters have traits that can be "burned" (rendered unusable, they get replaced at the session's end) to let you immediately roll more dice.<br/><br/><i>Jaci decides to burn her <b>strength of serenity</b> trait, as she flies in a mad rage at Bruce. She rolls three dice, getting 1, 4, 5. Her pool is now 1, 4, 4, 5, 6. Because Bruce doesn't have any sets left, and Jaci has one, she gets to go again. She spends it, and inflicts an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effect</span> on Bruce.</i> (when you take two effects from the same skill, you're out of the fight and--if you choose--dead)<br/><br/>The characters also have a better shot at success than it might seem, because they're all on a team (and can lend dice to one another), while their enemies all draw on a single dice pool (albeit one that's bigger).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
