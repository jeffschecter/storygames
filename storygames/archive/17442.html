It relates specifically to <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17273/smallville-rules-questions-and-play-techniques/p1" rel="nofollow">THIS</a> discussion on Smallville started by Joel, and the mecha campaign he's been running for a few weeks.<br/><br/>Anyway, note I'm just copying and pasting what I had typed on G+, and I'll adjust formatting as much as I can:\n<blockquote>Just trying to get my ideas down for what I am tentatively calling <i>Mecha-Opera</i>, a dramatic space-opera/mecha anime game that has arisen from Joel Shempert's <i>Mechaville</i> campaign, spurred by my desire to have a Cortex+ system game that supports giant fighting robots and dramatic anime scenes, while not being bogged down by unnecessary details like power-plant outputs, heatsinks, rates of fire, etc.<br/><br/>These are just the components of making a Lead, because, really, that's the only thing that makes it differ than...say...the base rules of <i>Smallville</i>. It's still a bit in flux, because I like to tackle with naming conventions...blame it on the obsessive compulsions in my brain.<br/><br/><b>VALUES</b><br/>Those things that spur your Lead to action, and connect them to the story. Measured by ratings between D4 and D12, with related statements.<br/>Honor, Glory, Power, Purpose, Heart, Wisdom<br/><br/><b>BONDS</b><br/>How you are connected with the other Leads and important cast members. Also measured by ratings between D4 and D12 with related statements.<br/><br/><b>DRIVES</b><br/>Motivations and driving forces behind your Lead's destiny. These function like Distinctions in Marvel Heroic, often brought into play as a beneficial D8, but also can be used as a disadvantage, giving the Master a D6 Trouble and earning a Plot Point.<br/><br/><b>TRAITS</b><br/>Skills, talents, advantages, and special abilities. This covers everything from being a really good pilot, to being attractive, and even psychic powers (since the characters aren't superheroes, the effects of psychic powers are more narrative than anything else - "I use my Telepathy D8 to peer into his mind as I question him..."). Measured by ratings between D4 and D12.<br/><br/><b>EXTRAS</b><br/>Temporary advantages, gear, contacts, and access you can use. Like most everything else, measured by ratings between D4 and D12. You can only use them once per Episode...if you use them again, you permanently Step Down its rating. Luckily, Extras will be easy to gain and replenish.<br/><br/><b>SYSTEMS</b><br/>This is what most people will be interested in - the things that their Mecha, Powersuits, special Devices, or Spaceships are capable of. It's unlikely any single character will have more than one Mecha, or Suit, or whatever, but in case they somehow do, they can't use abilities from each, like with the Power Sets of Marvel Heroic. Just doesn't work that way.<br/>These are all defined by their Systems, measured again in ratings between D4 and D12 only if the Systems in question actually have any effect on your performance!!! Sure your ship may have some armor, but if it isn't a major feature, it probably won't have a Defense rating to help it.<br/>There will be one overarching Limit for your item, such as the Giant Size of Mecha, losing Gear, etc., and individual Systems may have their own Limits that affect how and when they can be used. They will also have Effects, which are added abilities and stunts your System is capable of (kinda like SFX in Marvel Heroic).<br/>The Systems are:<br/><b>Boost</b> - Engine power and frame strength<br/><b>Speed</b> - Surface movement, either ground or water<br/><b>Flight</b> - Air and space movement<br/><b>Sensors</b> - Scanning and detection<br/><b>Defense</b> -  Durability, shields, and forcefields<br/><b>Assault</b> - Weaponry and targeting systems<br/><b>Network</b> - Communications and encryption<br/><b>Stealth</b> - Cloaking fields and electronic counter-measures<br/><b>Servos</b> - Maneuverability and reflexes<br/><b>Utility</b> - Mechanical advantages (repair systems, tool-hands, etc.)<br/><br/>...I'll type up more ideas later, but right now I need to get back to work...</blockquote>\n<br/>Anyhoo, I'm interested in peoples' thoughts on this concept.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcadia" title="Darcadia"><img alt="Darcadia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcadia">Darcadia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395106/#Comment_395106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T03:36:33+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  3:36AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it a fascinating idea.
