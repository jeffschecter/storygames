                            Okay, just to be clear... the two big approaches I've observed are "Let's play this exactly as the author has it written until we understand why he did it that way," and "Let's just start fiddling with it off the bat." (I'm a proponent of the former, so somebody else can probably more accurately state the latter view. Levi?)                        </div>

                            Enh.  I'd say no.<br/><br/>Not that it's a bad rule.  Huge amounts can be done both with simplicity and with an emphasis on making things transparent to non-gamers, but the obligation to do so is not universal.  Like any hobby, there is a reward that comes from depth of esoterica or interest, and you can write a fantastic game that's _not_ going to be universally accessable, and it can still rock.  Chess is awesome, but so is Advanced Squad Leader (or so I'm told).  Chess may be _more_ awesome, but that's not really the point, is it?<br/><br/>It absolutely bumps up against the geek social fallacy issue - exclusion bad! - but that's its own thing. Anyway, no objection to the principle in general, but always is a dangerous word.<br/><br/>That said, since I have no idea from whence this is spun, what exactly are we talking about?<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

Totally accurate.<br/><br/>I rebuilt one of the classes from the PHB in my very first game of D&amp;D 3.0.  It was a total cock-up, completely broken, and we patched and screwed with the rules constantly to deal with it and all the other stuff I changed; this in no way stopped us from having a blast, but it wasn't even remotely a "serious" game for us.  It wasn't until about 3.5 that I ran a single 'straight' game of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I can now hack and alter d20 with almost buttery ease.                        </div>

                            Well, the pro argument for fiddling has always been, "I just like fiddling." The con argument says that we all got that way because early bad designs sent us all off looking for better. That if D&amp;D actually satisfied all agendas that we'd not be having this discussion today.<br/>
<br/>
It's an unusual phenomenon. Imagine if you were a comic afficianado, but every time you got one, your first impulse was to white out some of the panels and write in your own? Perhaps a better analogy, in modeling this is called "Kit Bashing" where you take the model out of the box, and immediately start using it for something other than it's intended purpose. Or you make it once, and then disassemble it to use the parts with other models.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that, at some point, it becomes too constraining with something creative like this to always work with what you get out of the box. After a while you become good enough at modifying things that, I suppose, kit-bashing becomes more interesting than just assembling he model at hand. I have to admit that few RPGs I've ever encountered have endured first contact with me running them intact.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, with a game like MLWM or DitV, I don't modify. So that would argue that I'm only altering rules when I see a problem. That's probably accurate. Certainly I prefer the rules to be as stable as possible when playing. After all, if I want something distinctly different, I can design my own game, or play something else closer to my needs.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thing...what's the other option in terms of design goals? Design a game that isn't clear as to how it runs, so it must be kit-bashed? Why? Can't a player do that anyhow, even if it works well as clearly designed? Would a comic be sent with just a bag full of panels that you have to sort? Would a model be sent sans instructions on how to build it? Even if you knew that people were kit-bashing it? To force people to kit-bash it?<br/>
<br/>
I'm completely ambivalent on the subject of whether or not games should be kit-bashed, modified, whatever. People should do with them what they want. But a designer does have an imperative to design a game that works well as written out of the box. With as little work neccessary on the part of those playing to figure out how. Not because kit-bashing is bad, but because some people want to just make the model like it looks on the cover of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Mike<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I play Advanced Squad Leader regularly. It's complexity comes in play from the combination of game elements that get entangled. Does an AT gun have LOS from a ditch to a second level house, if there are shrubs in the hex in front of it, and the crew is in a hiding status? But here's the thing. Even at that level of complexity, the game always has instructions. Yeah, occasionally it gets so complicated that you might not be able to tell what to do precisely - which rule takes prescedence over which? But the system never asks you to make up a rule. And people don't modify the rules because they don't find that they work. They only modify them to quicken play or the like. Stylistic stuff. Not fixes.                        </div>

We all know that people are going to kit-bash, so all I've done with my own game is do it for them...  here is the core of the game; as long as you don't mess with this, whatever you tinker with will in theory...work.<br><br>But, not everyone wants to kit-bash...so you simply finish the job and give them all the different ways to play, including your preferred ones.<br>This way, you don't force people to kit-bash, but you allow people the fun of going "hey...I can play this exactly the way I need to play it with this group of people!"<br><br>If people are going to do it anyways, why not have a say in suggesting HOW they do it?                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            On the Rule One issue... Sometimes I just want to write a game where I can tell someone to "frame a scene" and not explain in detail how that is done.  Sometimes it's just not worth your time writing for the Lowest Common Denominator if your game is probably only going to be played by 10-20 hardcore indie games people.  In those cases, better to assume a high level of familiar to save yourself time and effort.  However, if you're hoping to write for a more broader audience, a different approach is certainly called for.                        </div>

                            I am completely a "fiddle with it immediately" sort of person. Actually everyone else is too, there are some deluded folks who think that GURPS is altered if you write a rule where you roll a d20 instead of 3d6 but not altered if you write a character that nobody involved in the creation of GURPS ever wrote before, I have no time for this point of view, it seems mad, mad, mad I say, but that is what they say of me too. Ah well.<br>

                            Responding to Shreyas a bit, I think a lot of people tweak to make a game more familiar and compatible with their existing style of play, which takes away some of the challenge of learning to play within a new framework of guidelines.  But, than again, if the challenge does not seem interesting or rewarding to you (like, I don't know, Shreyas learning to love Wushu or something), tweaking may be necessary to create a set of guidelines that DO challenge players in ways they find interesting or rewarding.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, doesn't scene framing work differently in different games?  Your ideal there seems to assume that "frame a scene" always means the same thing, when in fact a <em>PTA</em> scene frame is different from a <em>DitV</em> scene frame is different from a <em>TSOY</em> scene frame.  Or are you suggesting that your ideal game would work regardless of what flavor scene frame the players chose to use?                        </div>

                            Also to Jonathan -- I find this "tweak for familiarity" thing very persuasive.  That's what I see when I watch other people do the "open the box, start tweaking" thing.  Where <em>obviously</em> you need X rule in any game, and so you kitbash what comes out of the box so that it has X rule.  It seems to me that this stems from a "This is what roleplaying <em>is</em>" sort of mentality, which precludes exploring new ways to play.                        </div>

                            I think the enforced dichotemy between relentless kit-bashing and exactly-by-the-rules play is causing more harm than good.<br/><br/>It washes out the fact that all RPGs are evolving as we play them. Sometimes the players intend changes (choosing options and kit-bashing), sometimes the evolution is more subtle (misapplying a rule, and then remembering the misapplication when it comes up again). Both sides seem to want to still these dynamics - whether by changing to a different but "stable" version or by playing exactly as it is. <br/><br/>Now the tragedy of this is that dynamics can do far more than a static configuration can. We're seeing the tip of the iceberg with some of the pacing and evolving mechanics being developed now. But there's much more design space. <br/><br/>Why do we as designers tend to cede the crafting of characters so easily, but not the crafting of system? <br/><br/>Players change the game they are playing. Its not a matter of whether we should, but the fact that we do. When we design we should try to take that into account and even encourage the kind of changes in the game that meets our goals. <br/><br/>But to do this we must first understand how games change while we play them. And that means giving up the illusion that they do not.<br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            I don't think the question is to tweak or not to tweak, since I'm pretty sure almost all of us use tweaked systems in a form or another.<br/>
<br/>
I think the question is whether you should tweak even before you understand the system or not? And as a premise: when do you think you understood a system? After reading the rules, after one session, after a campaign, or some other time?<br/>
<br/>
My answer is:<br/>
I want to know why the system does what it is doing before tweaking it. The time of understanding a system varies, some designers give insights through the game text so I better understand why mechanics were implemented, some don't. Some games have easier rules, some have complex parts.<br/>
Regarding "tweak-friendly" systems, it's kinda easy: for example in Universalis we use the rules as written to give rule gimmicks.                        </div>

                            What Jonathan said.<br/>
<br/>
JD, by "unusual" I mean the idea of taking a finished product and chopping it up. FanFic is creating entirely new fiction - more like creating a game in the same genre than chopping up a game. In any case I don't mean to say that it's uncommon. As my example of kit-bashing models is supposed to say. It's a recognized activity. It just seems to me that it's odd to feel a need to do such a thing to a finished product.<br/>
<br/>
It might be indicative that the person in question doesn't like the original product. Might.<br/>
<br/>
I've gotta stop using analogies now. Because to extend the analogy to FUDGE, to cover Rob, that's like getting a kit with lots of parts with instructions on how to create a model from those parts. Which is a very different thing than being given a complete model with bad or incomplete instructions. See, analogy's stretching.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I'd actually be the first to say that FUDGE isn't really a very good game this way. Not that the "toolkit" thing isn't a conscious design decision, and not that it's done to hide some fact of it being incomplete. But just that even as a toolkit I think it leaves something to be desired.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I like Hero System, so I'm probably biased there. The point is that the "toolkittish" nature of a game says nothing about whether or not it's got instructions on how to use those tools or not.<br/>

I can't speak for others, but when I'm talking about modifications, I'm not talking about including the pieces without instructions.   I'd tend to think of it more of a solid product with do it yourself expansion ideas.   It's not supplying just the tools and saying make a game; it's more of a matter of supplying a game and saying, here's what you can do to alter it and here is what you need to modify it.<br><br>I tend to think of those as two different things.   As a result, I don't see a problem in that people feel a need to modify games to suit the needs of the group playing.<br><br>I agree with wyrmwood in that it is going to happen, whether people want it to or not, and if it bothers people, they should consider including ways to guide or suggest modifications.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I suspect that disagreement is over the importance of the game designer compared to the play group.  <br><br>For example, I've never played unmodified RuneQuest or CORPS, but I've used them in kitbashed games.  I don't think this is disrespect to the game designer.  I wanted to run a detailed sci-fi game based on Star Trek, and at first used CORPS as a basis.  Similarly, I had an idea for my Vinland game of Icelanders in the New World, and started with RuneQuest for my rules.  In both cases, I had something which I wanted to do, and to get it, I took the closest game to get what I wanted -- and modified it from there.  So I picked up the game at that time not to play it as written, but to use it for something which I already had an idea for.  <br><br/>This is basically the same approach that most game designers work from, taking elements from an existing game (like The Prince's Kingdom or True20, say).  Indeed, I think the only clear difference is whether you package the result of your kitbashing for official publication in the end.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            This may be a contentious bit, but it's about as mild as I can put it.<br/><br/>If people are bothered by others altering their games, and cannot let go of that, they should consider not selling games.<br/><br/>When a text suggests different ways to alter the rules, I read those, and most of the time I giggle like a child, because the suggestions given tend to seem <i>timid</i>.  They often read, <b>to me</b>, as if the designers are trying to placate people from actually digging into the plumbing in any serious way.                        </div>

And we're talking a game for which this is not the abberration, but rather, the _goal_.  It's kind of easy to be dismissive of that as a designer, but that's kind of snotty on my part.

                            I currently play in two regular game-night-thingies.  On Tuesdays, we have a playtest night where we take a game and try to experience how the game is supposed to be played, play it hard and see if there are breakpoints, and see if those breakpoints are interesting in terms of the play experience or not.  I love playtest Tuesdays.  On Thursdays, we play an ongoing <em>Primetime Adventures</em> game where we're moderately stringent about following the rules, but relatively loose about larger play structure and whatnot.  I love <em>PTA</em> Thursdays.<br/><br/>Point being?  There is no one answer.  There's not even a one answer for a single player (me).  There are different answers that are appropriate for different situations pursuing different goals.                        </div>

Somebody point out to me the designer who doesn't think that their game is going to be altered? The one who you're saying shouldn't design games. The one that John is subtly saying has too big an ego.<br/>
<br/>
You get that from what Shreyas writes here? Or me? Then I suggest you carefully re-read.<br/>

It's not a matter of letting go.

And if I don't like it, I get to complain that the game sucks. Customer's always right, I guess. <br/><br/>What a customer does with a game they purchase is their business. <br/>When they criticize the integrity of a design that worked for the designer and playtesters, the designer needs to check to see whether the design is truly flawed, or decide whether to defend the design (that's usually how it works in the RPG field.) <br/><br/>It's a matter of customer support. If a customer flexes the rules in ways that I provide as options, I'm willing to provide encouragement and assistance, and even acknowledge that my design overlooked something. If a customer starts adding in crap I never intended my system to accommodate, my interest and enthusiasm (and indeed, tolerance) for their complaints and inquiries will be zero. <br/><br/>We had a saying in a long-standing DnD game when the DM or a player wanted to challenge another player: <br/>"I can run your character better than you can." <br/>At least there, we had the advantage of watching the target player play his character for a while. <br/><br/>If you can make a better game than the one I wrote, why did you buy mine? <br/>If you screw with my design before trying it, how do you know your ideas are better than the base game?                        </div>

                            Er, admittedly I was attacking the straw men because it was blocking the view of what I wanted to point out.

My Life With Master is actually a specifically bad example to me, because it isn't <i>quite</i> an open-sale product.  Pauls goals with the game have very little to do with getting the game a wide audience.<br/><br/>For those games where the objective is, at least in part, a wide audience, why feel any degre of real concern about people buying it, modding it, and bitching about it?  This does the designer no harm at all and may do them plenty of good - as I see it, their main enemy is not being misunderstood or being slammed, but having their game dismissed as *insignificant*.                        </div>

                            I'm with you, Rumble, when you've said that if someone didn't try the food before adding the salt, they've got no right to bitch.    But I have a hard time believing that anyone would take them seriously for the bitching, after all, wouldn't it be obvious that they added the salt before trying the food?   (anyone lost, read the other thread "systems" for reference)<br/><br/>In most cases though, or at least here? I think that alot of people aren't talking about broken games as much as they are talking about games that work just fine the way they are, but for some reason, doesn't fit the requirements needed for how they want or need to play it.<br/><br/>I don't think most people hold a game in any less regard if they modify it under those conditions, but do it because they really want to play that game as closely to the original way as possible but don't have a way to do it without modifying it? Or there are some people who just love twisting a game after they've played it a few times to see if they can.<br/><br/>Or there are people who just love to mod games, because they can.<br/><br/>So maybe one of the conflicts in question isn't if people mod, but the two distinctly groups of people that do it?  <br/>Just a thought, I could be way off with that tangent.       <br/><br/>I've seen lots of games that I wouldn't imagine adding salt to, but then again, there are always some that you can't resist the urge... I've never seen it as the designer's fault when it happens.  (okay...not never, but not often either!)                        </div>

There was a solid year where people would bitch about<em>Dogs</em>and Vincent would come onto the thread and ask, "Did you use the Town Creation rules?" and they'd admit that they hadn't, and the thread would deflate.<br/><br/>This seems tricky to me, because there is also a lot of praise for Dogs which comes from people who play modified versions of it.  There are two very common mods.  One is playing in a different setting (Banthas in the Vineyard, Wolves of the North, etc.).  The other is having raises which are not an action of the player's character -- which people often don't even call a mod.  However, people don't shout down praise for Dogs which modifies the written rules in this way.  Rather, they often praise the flexibility.  <br/><br/>It seems inconsistent.  If we're judging Dogs as a purely-as-written work, then we have to dismiss praise about the flexibility of it to work with other ways.  On the other hand, if we allow praise for it as a toolkit used for games other than exactly as written, then we have to accept criticism if it doesn't make clear how to play <i>as a toolkit</i>.                        </div>

                            That kind of brings us back to vertical flexibility, which is what I used to consider the signature of games out of the forge.  A game like Sorcerer or Paladin is both very restricitve and very flexible because there are very specific things you can change (What are demons? What is humanity? What are your three moral rules?) but within those things, the range of possibilities is vast indeed.  This model of having things that _mean_ something, but might _be_ anything, allowed an almost mad-libs sort of approach to the content, while still sticking to the creator's vision of the shape of the game.<br/><br/>I don't really consider it an indie signature any longer.  It's still there, but it's been eclipsed by other things as "the thing that looks indie to me."  Still, Dogs was one of the points of transition, so the fact that it's still got that flex seems entirely right.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Fascinating thread, as much for its content as for the already-mentioned ships passing at night with their guns at the ready.<br/><br/>John, I don't think it's inconsistent to give two kinds of praises, one for works-as-written, one for flexibility.  If it can do both, great!  In fact, that's what I see throughout this thread:  We all expect a game to work well out of the "box," but a lot of us also expect to fiddle with it and test out what else we can do with it.<br/><br/>I really don't see a contradiction here.<br/><br/>Dogs, for example, earns praise for the way everything works together if you play it as written.  Now, it might also be cool to fiddle with, but it's not sold as a toolkit, so there's nothing it has to live up to in that regard.  If the game was sold on the basis of both how it works and how to use it as a toolkit, you could judge it on how it fulfills the latter standard.  The fact that it *does* allow for flexibility is like a bonus, like allowing you to mod a computer game but not providing instructions on how to achieve certain outcomes (while at the same time not making the moddability a selling point).                        </div>

Exactly. <br/><br/>If the author didn't provide toolkit options, then there are no documented standards upon which to base the quality of games derived from the base game. <br/><br/>In this case, any extended quality is sourced in the customer, not the game itself. <br/><br/>I can't speak for Dogs, but DoN is a toolkit system. I can, in fact, claim credit (or be lashed soundly) for any quality (or lack thereof) derived by manipulating the tools provided. ESPECIALLY when the customer comes to me for help and I provide them with support.                        </div>

                            So where's the inconsistency in that?  That people praise "Dogs the Game" for flexibility?  That's purely a semantic issue, because in this case, what they're praising are parts of the Dogs mechanics that are applicable to other game designs.  Dogs as a game advertises itself on played-as-written, which works wonderfully, and it also happens to have cool elements you can use in other games, but which are not advertised as a toolkit selling point.<br/><br/>There's "Say yes or roll the dice," Town Creation, Escalation, Initiation... I don't see how you could not give V credit for these just because he doesn't give instructions on how to use them for other purposes.                        </div>

I'm all for modding.  Not only is it inevitable, but it's also fun and a strong source of the hobby's badge of pride.  So I make my games so they're moddable, sure.<br/><br/>But the flipside is that modding game designs that you don't well understand pretty much voids the warranty.  You can, like Levi, make that a learning experience, but if you're doing it to learn, expecting it to work in an entertaining fashion is kind of silly.  So in <em>Dogs</em>, you need that structured Town Creation that stems from a hierarchy of sin / things going wrong.  If you don't, the game collapses no matter if you're playing Dogs or Jedi or Mobsters.  This is something that you come to understand by playing it a couple times, but it may not be obvious on the first read.                        </div>

Which <i>gottverdammt</i> warranty is that?  Any warranty I can see beyond physical workmanship would hinge on the idea that the entire game was in the book, which it cannot ever ever be.  If anything, I'd warrant that most likely two tables playing a game based on the same rules-text will have different lumpley-style systems.  In essence: you cannot help but "mod" a game.  And if your table has fun, you're all due the credit.  Likewise the blame for a dull or upsetting session.<br/><br/>Which does beg the question: what does the rules-text owe you?  Because I definitely feel like a book should be bringing <em>something</em> to the table, and I can think of examples where the book didn't measure up.  But I have yet to find the bar.                        </div>

                            The warranty* that says, "If you follow the directions and use the inspirational setting material in this book, you will produce a game experience as described in this book."  Sure, there is interpretation in any game, but that's <em>playing the game</em>, and can be expected by the designer.  Modding, which is intentionally and consciously changing the procedures presented in the book, is a different magnitude.<br/><br/>You can add skills in <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.  That's interpretation, and it's certainly expected on my part.  There's even a section on the character sheet for it.<br/><br/>Making those skills range from 1-5 instead of 1-4 and rolling five dice instead of four dice is changing the design.  That's modding, and that's going to change how the game operates.  I suspect it would detract a little from the game, but your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>And it's the "Your Mileage May Vary" part that's the kicker, I think.  Adding skills will not change the operation of the game and you will still produce the game experienced as advertised.  If that game experience is not your cup of tea, well, I warned you in the introduction what to expect and when you got that, you shouldn't be surprised.  Once you start modding a design, you can no longer expect to produce that game experience, <em>and that's the point</em>.  Modding is an attempt to change the game experience into something different, preferably something you like more than the game as-is.<br/><br/>* this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_warranty" rel="nofollow">implied warranty of fitness for a particular use</a>.  I understand you're used to the Napoleonic Code, Judson, but out here in Common Law land, we have implied warranties.  It's just how we roll.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite><img alt="image" src="src"/>I really don't see a contradiction here.<br/><br/>Dogs, for example, earns praise for the way everything works together if you play it as written.  Now, it might also be cool to fiddle with, but it's not sold as a toolkit, so there's nothing it has to live up to in that regard.  If the game was sold on the basis of both how it works and how to use it as a toolkit, you could judge it on how it fulfills the latter standard.  The fact that it *does* allow for flexibility is like a bonus, like allowing you to mod a computer game but not providing instructions on how to achieve certain outcomes (while at the same time not making the moddability a selling point).</blockquote>
Well, I agree about the basic point, but in practice, modifying games is very common.  Even if you say that it's not really the designer's responsibility, I think it's a relevant topic to comment on.  The inconsistency would be if when discussing modified play, you only recognize the positive cases when people had fun, and dismiss the negative cases when they didn't have fun as irrelevant.  <br/><br/>I realize that there are people who are consistent in this, though.  <br/><br/>For example, in a review one might comment on playing the game exactly as written, but then also have a comment about how easily it adapts.  In that section, one would comment both on the positive and negative experience people had with modified play.                        </div>

                            I seem to recall that Vincent expressed doubt as to the ability of Dogs to work in other genres. He was like, "Well, try it if you like, but I have no idea what'll come of it." In other words it's been the experiences of other people that have caused them to claim that it's eminently suitable for this sort of thing. An accident of design at best. They took a risk and it payed off. As does anybody modifying a game from the rules.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a game like FUDGE can better claim credit for success in modifying it, as it does, in fact, require such modification, and gives instruction for how to do so. Not really modification, then, but use of the design as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have credited Universalis for modified play, citing that it has a rule that allows the game to be modified. But we pretty clearly say in the book that Caveat Fiddler applies to the Gimmick rule. We take "credit" for the play only to the point that the changes will be functional in that there's an explicit way to make them. After that, the actual effect of the change? All credit to the player who makes the change.<br/>
<br/>
Saying that the Gimmick rule in Universalis made us responsible for the successes that stem from it's use would be like the designers of WOD games saying that mods of the game were to their credit, since they have the Golden Rule in the games which say it's allowable to change the game. This would be analogous to a car manufacturer saying that he gets credit for any improvments to the car you make because they said it's OK for you to take the car to the garage and have it modified there.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, to dangerously extend the analogy, the only difference in Universalis is that we include a road map to the mechanic's shop in the glove compartment. A small feature at best.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, John, I'm not seeing the hypocrisy that you're claiming. At least not from the designers who believe that they should do as good a job as they can in providing directions for the use of their game.<br/>

Most people learn from example, in my experience, so I personally applaud it when games give you ways to make it work for what you may be trying to do.<br><br>(this is a little off-track, but this is what I personally got from the last few segments)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think the "I drift everything until it squeals" approach is over-represented (a) in forum-posting RPGers and (b) among RPGers with an interest in design. Sara (shutupgirl)'s attitude is way, way more common than we tend to realize, in my experience.<br><br>This may be a point in favor of System Does Matter. Or it may just be a differentiation between people - my experience also suggests that people who don't adopt the "I like to drift and tinker" perspective either drop out of the hobby or are perpetual players, rather than GMs, relying on the drifting skillz of a l33t GM. (Probably, although not invariably, named Herbie.)                        </br></br></div>
