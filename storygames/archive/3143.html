This was on Friday, and so as people arrived and things got churning, he never got to finish the story. Here's what I remember:<br/><br/>*Jason (or whatever his name was at the time) was piloting (not captaining) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_ships" rel="nofollow">Chinese Treasure Ship</a><br/>*The actual encounter took place on one of the Hawaiian Islands<br/>*The Helmet of Ping was involved, and had to be obtained in the course of things<br/>*Alcohol was involved<br/>*Trickery was involved<br/>*All or nearly all of the crew were killed<br/>*Jason killed the Devil and got his name.<br/><br/>But there's lots more to the story! and its scattered throughout old books and folklore collections, and scholarly articles in journals like "Record of the East-Australian Oneirologists League". Problem is, I don't have any of the source materials and Jason won't tell me the story until I know a little bit more!<br/><br/>Luckily, I know you're all pretty well-read, with excellent collections. I'm hoping you'll take the time to copy a paragraph or two from one of the writings you have on the subject. It can be anywhere in the whole story, from the time the Fleet leaves China up through the time Jason leaves the Islands. I'm given to believe there were many adventures. Remi may or may not have been there, it's not clear.   Please help me by posting whatever you know of the story. Please cite your sources!<br/><br/>I'm gone for the long weekend starting tomorrow, but I'm hoping we'll have enough pieces by Tuesday for Jason to take pity and tell us some of the part's we've missed or where certain authors have taken liberties. I'll include one of the few scraps of the story I have below.

It was there that they were able to obtain fresh mulberry leaves for the silkworms aboard the ship to spin the silk patches necessary to repair and continue. Departing from Zai-tun, and continuing on an easterly course, but inclining to the south, itwas another two months' navigation before the shores of Manji were sighted. About the coasts there much gold-dust is collected from the sea at those places where the rivers discharge themselves. Copper is also in abundance there, and is beaten into sheets in which the dead of that land are buried.

'Jason' simply indicates a quester; see Chapter 3, 'Things That Have a Vague Resemblance are Equal to Each Other', where I show conclusively the identity between the 'Helmet of Ping', the Golden Fleece, and the Holy Grail (not to mention the True Cross, the Higgs boson, and the mainstream crossover story-game). 'Morningstar' is evidently the name he supposedly took from the Devil (Lucifer, the Morning Star). We need look no further for his legendary status than this: Some texts claim he was married to 'Autumn'. (The identification of Morningstar's wife as a librarian arose from a simple misreading of 'Media' for 'Medea'.)<br/><br/>"As for Remi Treuer ('Truer Memory'), his colleague, rival and sidekick, he occurs late in the canon, and is clearly introduced as a more stable foil to the hyperactive Morningstar. No clearer evidence of the legendary status of these characters can be adduced than this: Treuer is traditionally portrayed as somewhat stocky in appearance, while Morningstar is described as thin. Evidently, we have here the classic comedic duo, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Cook and Moore, Fry and Laurie, Smith and Jones. The archetype is already well established in Shakespeare."<br/><br/>- Sigmund von Zeitgeist, <i>Reductionism for Morons</i>, Dodder Verlag (forthcoming).<br/><br/>I caught up with Professor von Zeitgeist at a conference, where he had just given his interesting paper "Clinton Nixon: Mythic Archtype of the Scandalous Leader", and asked him if the Smith and Jones he referred to were the British duo of Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, or the Americans Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. He looked at me pityingly and said curtly that my asking the question showed clearly that I had not understood his work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
