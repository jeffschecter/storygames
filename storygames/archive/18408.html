Because I had no new releases (aside from a T-shirt) since I was last in England for Dragonmeet late last year, I decided to run a little experiment.<br/><br/>Everything at the table was "Pay What You Want."<br/><br/>I was really stressed out going in, wondering if I was going to lose my ass from a bunch of people taking one copy of everything for \xa31 or something like that. But as I was telling people, "I don't expect people to pay the full regular price, but I trust them not to completely screw me."<br/><br/>Turns out, I was right.<br/><br/>Absolutely nobody gave ridiculous low payments for stuff until the last hours of the convention when I was using the "Come on, don't make me lug all this stuff back to Finland!" line at passersby. Hoping those buyers like what they read and come back for more at least...<br/><br/>Here are the changes in business at my table between the 2012 Expo and this year:<br/><br/>Gross income: +65%<br/>Units Sold: +95%<br/>Number of Customers: +123%<br/>Average \xa3 value of purchase per customer: -26%<br/><br/>I think I made out like a bandit.<br/><br/>Several things skew the figures though. The Expo was at a new venue this year and apparently there was a decent jump in attendance and everyone I talked to in the dealers' room seemed to experience sales growth from last year. Also, I sold out of my two "big ticket" items fairly quickly (a hardcover and a box set which had sold last year for \xa320 and \xa325 each, respectively) and had I brought more of those, all of those % changes would be even more favorable... but stock at foreign conventions is limited by "What me and my wife can fit into our luggage" and I'd figured I'd move a lot of smaller items at very low prices so I loaded up on those. Or maybe I was just afraid that I'd let go of too many of the bigger items at miniscule prices?<br/><br/>I'd publicized the "Pay What You Want" thing on my blog and social media, but my followers are spread out around the world and not concentrated where the Expo is held (Birmingham), so people didn't know. It was great fun watching people be startled as they read the "price list" or when I told them "Pay what you want," when they asked how much something cost. Many were uncomfortable with the pricing scheme and asked the regular prices (which I didn't keep secret if people asked).<br/><br/>Now the next convention I'll attend as a vendor is in Finland. Will the difference between the Finnish and British mentalities make a difference? I'll also be carrying a few new releases by then. Will that make a difference? Nailbite time.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414770/#Comment_414770" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T02:06:37+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  2:06AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I have generally had a very good experience with "Pay what you want" as a model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414774/#Comment_414774" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T02:54:12+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  2:54AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That all went even better than I expected in advance. Specifically, not as many customers as I expected, but the ones you got paid more than I hoped for. I imagine that if you had more aggressive sales tactics (eye-catching booth adverts, an advert in the program pamphlet, whatever), that'd translate into more people coming, but also more people willing to pay ridiculously low prices. Probably your relatively low-profile approach meant that the vast majority of your customers were strongly predisposed towards buying something from you anyway, and thus the flexible discount helped seal the deal.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414783/#Comment_414783" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T08:17:36+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  8:17AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing this Jim.

However, I also wanted to say that I was chatting to a guy yesterday who'd talked to you on your stand, and he was very impressed with your presence/persona, and told how you'd seen a beautiful red-haired woman one day and gone '<i>That's</i> the Flame Princess.' Also, one of my party (the Indie GoD mob) bought a T-shirt, and another runs LotFP (Carcosa flavour) in his home group. I hope to play LotFP one day myself- by all accounts it's an awesome game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414805/#Comment_414805" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T20:42:23+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  8:42PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just so happens that ConTessa, the online game convention just posted at LotFP game or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414806/#Comment_414806" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T20:51:29+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  8:51PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'll be interesting to see how Fate Core pans out, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414826/#Comment_414826" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T08:54:10+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  8:54AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'all have seen the <a href="http://bundleofholding.com/index/current" rel="nofollow">Bundle of Holding</a> thing, right?
