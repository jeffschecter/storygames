It was Furnace, a wonderful little convention in Sheffield, and I only knew one player.<br/><br/>So I'll spare you the gory detail, but the best bits were:<br/><br/>1. A PC died in the first ten minutes. (This gained me, as the GM, much credibility with the Cthulhu crowd). They both wanted to be Captain and drew swords.<br/><br/>2. The game ended with someone bribing the cook to poison the Captain. So, quite, quite beautifully, the game both began and ended with the crew standing on the deck, their Captain dead and the assassin in front of them.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
