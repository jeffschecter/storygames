When I think of game designers in this part of the field who are known to give insightful and useful feedback, or would be great to consult with while developing a game, these names come to mind:<br/><br/>* Vincent Baker<br/>* John Stavropoulos<br/>* Eero Tuovinen<br/>* John Harper<br/>* Ron Edwards<br/>* Ralph Mazza<br/>* Jason Morningstar<br/>* David Berg<br/><br/>I've chosen these people because of their a) I like their way of thinking about RPGs, in terms of practical concerns, theory, and marketing/presentation, b) I've seen them demonstrate a high level of the ability to explain their ideas and thoughts on a regular basis, and c) I've witnessed their critiques of many games, and find them reliably both incisive and insightful.<br/><br/>There are many other designers I respect and admire, but I am not as familiar with their ability (or even desire) to critique games or help in their design. Unfortunately, many of my favourite female game designers fall into this latter category - some brilliant minds and some fantastic games, but, for whatever reason, I'm not as familiar with their game criticism, so to speak. (I think part of it is that honest game critique is much less "in vogue" nowadays than it was, say, at the Forge 10-15 years ago, and so much of my list consists of the "old guard" from those days.)<br/><br/>To actually assemble a team limited to 3-5 consultants, I'd have to consider carefully the subject matter and design of my game, and try to put together a team which covers a lot of different bases. Where do my own strengths and weaknesses lie? Where is the game lacking? I might end up choosing people who are not my 'top choices' to round out a team with the right set of skills and a good variety of viewpoints. (Another point in the process where I would be seriously reconsidering the lack of representation on my team, and might make efforts to change that! My list above is very homogeneous in that sense, and that would be an important weakness to address.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
