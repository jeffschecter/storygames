It came from a tiny indie company called StarChilde Publications, and was written and illustrated by someone named "Gideon."  It came out in '88, but I picked it up the summer of '92, and used it to run a solo campaign for my friend Paul.  It still is my all-time favorite sci-fi RPG.  It was set-up very differently than most RPGs of the time...actually, it was set up very differently.  Which is part of why I enjoyed it so much.  It also helped that Paul and I had both read the book "Sentenced To Prism" by Alan Dean Foster and we're both very interested in exploring a Prism like setting, Paul as a player/explorer, me as a GM/creator.   In many ways it was the easiest campaign I ever ran.  I picked up the book, showed it to Paul, we talked about a world to explore, agreed on it, and ran the campaign.<br/><br/>It wasn't until very recently (three months?) that I was exposed to the "Indie Press Revolution," and places like The Forge and Story Games.  Luckily I'm a quick learner.  I read a bunch of articles and essays, picked up a bunch of big name books, listened to a bunch of podcasts, got inspired to write a game, yadda yadda.  One of the big name games I picked up was <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> which really, really excited me.  So much of it made so much sense to me, solved so many of the problems I had with story telling in games.<br/><br/>And maybe two weeks later, I was pondering the greatness of DitV and using all of these new ideas and this new lexicon of terms to which I've been exposed to explain why DitV rocks my world.  I was doing this in part to figure out what it was about DitV I wanted to steal for my own game, figure out what that structure was that I was responding to.<br/><br/>And while I was doing that, I suddenly understood why Justifiers was so awesome.  Justifiers and Dogs in the Vineyard have the same essential structure underlying them, the difference being that Justifiers never acknowledges what the hell it's doing (did the author even know?), whereas I think Vince Baker's design and GMing section in particular show a lot more self-awareness.<br/><br/>In Justifiers, the players play Justifiers.  This is the first commonality between Dogs and Justifiers.  The central nature of the player characters is expressed right there in the title.  Contrast that with a title like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which makes no mention of the player.  <br/><br/>Anyways, the players play Justifiers.  Justifiers are Betas, artificially created half-human half-animal creatures kitted up in corporate laboratories to sidestep certain pesky legally protected human rights restrictions.  They are loaded onto "jumpships" which are about the size of a long big-city bus.  The jumpship is packed to the gills with gear.  It's exactly wide enough and long enough to fit through a "jump gate" to another star system, as the gates can only be opened so wide for so long.  Normally a jumpship travels from one jump portal to another, but Justifiers are sent on "blind jumps" to unknown worlds.  Their job is to set up a return portal, scout out the world, determine if its exploitable by the corp that made them, and come home.  My Evil DM side's absolute favorite part of the system is the Jump Roll, a random percentile roll made at the start of every new mission.  It's basically a 1 in 100 chance that you beam into a star or planet and die instantly.  You roll this after character creation.  It's brilliant.  It's the system announcing "You Are Disposable."  the Jump Roll can also lead to less instantly fatal issues, like crash landings (as it turns out large square wingless buses are a bitch to land).<br/><br/>By doing this, they "justify" their existence.  They get paid a bounty (after deducting expenses, they have to pay for the jump, their ammo, all medical supplies, food, etc.), which goes towards their "buyback" which is the cost it took to create them.  Once paid, they are set free.  The way the game is set up, the average character will have to survive a hundred or so jumps to earn his or her freedom.  Paul and I played one mission for three months, so at the rate we we're going Paul would have earned his freedom sometime in 2014.  <br/><br/>System-wise, a Justify consists of a handful of stats which are generated randomly and then modified according to the "base stock" of the Justifier, with about 50 different animal species to choose from.  The option is also available to play humans, but this is strongly discouraged.  To this is added an "area of training," which is essentially an MOS.  You've got medical scientist, earth sciences, engineer, and combat specialty.  This allows you to have a full party.<br/><br/>So how is this like Dogs?  Well, in Dogs you play a Dog, and you've got a mission and you go do it.  Your Dog can have some variety, and no two Dogs are exactly alike, but you're always a Dog, and you always have the same mission.  Justifiers works the same way, where your Justifier is unique, but is always a Justifier and always has the same mission.  My game, <i>A murder of crows</i> works the same way, with players having the <i>illusion of character choice</i> in that they always play a Crow, and all Crows have the same mission, but each Crow is customizable and unique.  The difference is that Justifiers goes a step further and offers the illusion that you can escape and go do your own thing, presumabely to apologize for the fact that you have to play a Justifier and go Justify.  Dogs assumes that you don't need a in-setting "leash" to keep you on track with the game, and relies on social contract to ensure that players will continue playing Dogs and continue to remain focused on their mission.<br/><br/>Another point of connection is the Planet and the Town.  They play the same role in each game.  The players are sent into this new setting, there is conflict, players win or lose, move on to new planet, rinse, recycle, repeat.  This is where Justifiers falls apart, and Dogs rules.  Dogs recognizes this, and gives the GM a ton of advice and systems for creating Towns.  Justifiers gives little information on creating Planets, or filling them with conflicts.  It just sort of leaves that to the GM to muddle through for themself (though StarChilde released several adventure/supplements that detailed worlds with different sorts of environments and challenges).  The game worked so great for Paul and I because we both we're really excited by "Sentence to Prism," and so we were both invested in our roles, him as explorer, me as creator, and we agreed on the "setting" of the adventure mutually, but this was a total accident, just something that naturally developed out of a conversation.  If the game had simply put forward the idea that this is how adventures should be generated, with the players and GM discussing what sort of conflict they wanted, and what sort of setting, it would have beat the story games revolution by a decade.<br/><br/>Justifiers deserved to be reborn, I think.  The rule system, which was based on percentiles and was somewhat clunky, needs a lot of spit and polish, but it's begging for a player-participation world creation system, or some other spiffy feature.  I dunno.  It has a ton of story game potential though.  And I found it interesting that what made it work so well was the assigned character roles and built-in adventure plot, which are what make Dogs work so well, and this game came out a dozen years before Dogs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129644/#Comment_129644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T02:59:41+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  2:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy Jebus, I have this game!

I'm more interested in how both games use <i>illusion of choice</i> in character creation, and how both games come with an established plot which informs the creation of adventure.<br/><br/>In your most traditional games, the story and setting of the game is determined by the Game Master, not the System.  Like the original Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, where really the only thing predetermined by the system was the <i>genre</i>.  The game itself was designed to support many different settings that fell into the "Fantasy" genre.  Other early systems were big on being Generic, with GURPS more or less leading the way.<br/><br/>Later, there was a big industry shift towards providing setting along with system, but the story of the game was still left in the hands of the GM.  Vampire and the other World of Darkness games are the vanguard of this shift in the market.  More and more you began seeing setting-specific systems that were only nominally cross-balanced.<br/><br/>Dogs represents a new way of thinking, in which the author provides not just system, but also setting, <b>and also a story to tell with that setting</b>.  Now Dogs is very conscious of what it's doing here, but once I realized what Vince Baker did in Dogs, I realized that Gideon had done in Justifiers <i>without being conscious of it</i>, and that it was why Justifiers had gone off so relatively easy and been so enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's that structure, where the author provides system, setting <b>and</b> story that I'm interested in.  I hate having to figure out through trial and error what kind of stories a system is best at telling -- and many systems are clearly not built with this question in mind, trying to be systems for telling "all kinds" of stories, which means they generally fail to assist in telling any sort of story.<br/><br/>And I don't mean having mechanics for scene setting and all that.  I mean having a built in story.  Compare these ideas:<br/><br/>1) GURPS is a game about actors in settings who do actions.<br/>2) Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a game about character archetypes in a fantasy setting who do (mostly heroic) actions.<br/>3) Vampire: The Masquerade is a game about Camarilla Vampires in the World of Darkness who do actions.<br/>4) Dogs in the Vineyard is a game about Religious Police ("Dogs") in a Fantastic Wild West Utah who travel from town to town encountering Injustice who seek out the Sin that is the source of said Injustice.<br/><br/>Take an idea like "Out of the Box" gameplay.  Dogs wins on that hands down.  All you have to do is read the rules and apply them, and the game is good to go.  Make a town, fill it with people with conflicting agendas, grab some players, make some Dogs, play.<br/><br/>You want to play Vampire, you've got a lot more work to do before you can start playing.  More importantly, the game isn't designed to launch players off a starting pad on a particular trajectory.  Dogs tells the player "Make a Dog." and defines a Dog as "a person who travels from town to town blah blah blah".  Vampire tells a player to "Make a Vampire." and defines a Vampire as "a person with fangs."<br/><br/>See the difference there?  Person who does X vs Person with thing X.  In Dogs, the game itself tells you what your character's "story direction" is.  It tells you what the character will do after you are finished creating them.  Traditional games leave this to the GM to decide, or to the player to decide, without ever making it explicit -- and frequently implicitly supporting both positions -- which leads to much conflict, conflict which frequently involves the use of the word "railroad."<br/><br/>In Dogs, <i>the system</i> is a railroading GM.  Imagine if in the rules of D&amp;D it said "Your character is an Adventurer who works for the Wizard's Guild clearing out Dungeons and retrieving artifacts.  Each adventure will begin with your character and his allies, called a Party, meeting with a contact from the Wizard's Guild.  These meetings will usually occur in taverns.  When you meet with your contact, you will be given a new assignment involving a new Dungeon.  This is how you play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Rules for creating Dungeons are found in the Dungeon Master's Guide."  That's basically what Dogs does, except it's with Dogs, the Church, and Towns instead of Adventurers, Wizard's Guilds and Dungeons.<br/><br/>And because Dogs is meant to be used a system for telling this one type of story, all the rules you need to run Dogs are <b>really</b> in the game.  You'll only encounter problems if you try to run Dogs with a different story, a different plot.  Like you couldn't run a "dungeon crawl" using the Dogs rules, if it worked at all it would work poorly.  But you're not supposed to run dungeon crawls in Dogs, you're supposed to run a story about Dogs inserting themselves into the private lives of people.  So you've got a great set of rules for doing just that.  Who cares if they're crappy rules for doing other stuff?  They are AWESOME for what they do.<br/><br/>I hope that made some sort of sense.  I want to see more games like Dogs, where the setting implies the story, and the system reinforces the story by providing the tools to tell the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130023/#Comment_130023" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T15:15:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  3:15PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2008 3:15PM by Kobayashi.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes sorry about my mistake, I played Dogs a lot myself and couldn't see how Justifiers could be played with Dogs.
