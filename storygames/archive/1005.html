                    Over in Whatcha Playing, TonyLB said:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><strong>RPGs</strong>:  TSOY-a-go-go:  Our fun "Battlestar Galactica in a dungeon" motif is moving from "Let's all talk about how fucked we are" to "Oh shit!  Monsters!  There actually<strong>are</strong>big freakin' monsters in this abandoned city.  We are so fucked!"  We've simultaneously moved away from talky-talky Keys toward more aggressive ones.  There's a chicken-and-egg thing there that's fascinating to watch in action ... but also, watching the Keys, I have a good sense that these characters are near running their course.  The story is almost over, whatever twists our devious GM may have in mind.</blockquote>
I have questions about this.  Specifically:<br/>- How many sessions has this series run?  <br/>- How many advances? (For you, Tony; and maybe also a rough average of the rest of the group, since I'm given to understand those two numbers aren't exactly close.)<br/>- What are the tell-tales you're seeing that indicate the story's coming to a conclusion?  Strictly key-based, or are there other indicators?<br/><br/>Everyone else:  How long a run have *you* had, using TSoY?                </div>

                            We're driving our Spring-and-Autumn China TSOY game to a flaming conclusion in 3-4 sessions, after 30-ish sessions.  I'm guessing an average of 20 advances but that could be way off (at 5 XP per).  Our story really didn't turn out to be driven by keys in all aspects, although I suspect our next campaign (which will likely use TSOY rules again) probably will see them more tightly integrated in the overall story.  Mid-campaign we had a huge meta discussion about what we wanted to see, and have been driving play toward those goals, probably faster than anticipated.                        </div>

                            I'm GMing the "Battlestar Galactica in a Dungeon" game Tony's in. I actually emailed folks a few days before that post of Tony's that I thought were 2-3 sessions from wrapping up, which would put us at 7-8 sessions total, I think.<br/><br/>Now, I based that call off different cues than Tony does, I think: As GM, I know how many major NPCs are on my relationship map, and at this point the player-characters have encountered every single one and pretty much crushed or subdued all but two of them (that'd be Tony's character's scary grandmother, who looks younger than her grandkids and just possessed our priest, and the ox-sized yet incredibly stealthy tiger named Khan, whom our barbarian werewolf and general good guy recently bit on the ear).<br/><br/>I wasn't originally thinking of Keys so much, actually. But, as of the last session, of the three player characters, one has jettisoned her entire existing belief system and constructed another one on which she's beginning to act (Tony's character, Yoshi); another has jettisoned his entire belief system and started playing a dangerous and unsustainable game with the powers of darkness (Eric's character, Brother Vedis); and the third has resolutely held to his belief system despite mounting and increasingly intolerable pressure, including winning a conflict with the stakes of "Okay, if I beat him, I don't have to become King" (Jenn's character, Khaidu). So, again, we're clearly headed towards a climax.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that while the time betwen our sessions is fairly long -- anywhere from 1-3 weeks, given the confusions of summer scheduling -- the time in-game is freakin' intense. From our first session, when the player-characters pelted over the Long Bridge into the abandoned city barely ahead of the Horde, to the latest session, when they hauled their ragged band of refugees into better shelter only to find it occupied by a demon-summing psycho, it's been about 48 hours in-game. During which time, by the way, none of the PCs has actually had a chance to sleep that I'm aware of (though we can presumably handwave in a few naps here and there), and opportunities for rest and recreation have been so rare that at least two PCs have NEVER had a chance to refresh their Vigor pools and can only get new pool dice by spending advances.<br/><br/>Which they have some ungodly number of, luckily, but I don't have my data handy, nor did I actually track the XP very closely compared to the resulting changes on their sheets.                        </div>

                            We've had ... what ... five sessions?<br/>
<br/>
We've undermined our existing power structure and started making a new society (leaving enemies along the path).  We're on a journey to (comparative) safety.  When/if we get there, we'll have faced pretty much every bad thing in the city (except the ones Sydney hasn't thought up yet) and our people will have been tested by fire.<br/>
<br/>
Khaidu, our barbarian, has gone from a curmudgeonly outsider to the leader of our little tribe, and developed a very serious case of honor about the safety and good treatment of everyone, <i>particularly</i> those who cannot fight back.<br/>
<br/>
Brother Vedis has gone from believing in the Gods and his sacred mission to worshipping those who claim to be Gods ... but his worship is a ruse.  He thinks, now, that faith is just a dodge to get enough information to take them down, because ultimately their ideas for him are toxic and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Yoshi has gone from a subordinate, quiet girl to an outspoken <i>bitch</i> who will take you down as soon as look at you, and who believes vengeance is the purest form of human connection.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the overall indicators that I have that the story is coming to a conclusion:  these characters are no longer conflicted in themselves.  They're horribly dysfunctional, but we're <b>happy</b> with the dysfunction.  We no longer want them to change.<br/>
<br/>
I've probably gotten somewhere between fifty and sixty advances.  I suspect that the average is more around forty.<br/>
<br/>
I am, actually, a little <i>awed and scared</i> by Jason's description of a TSOY game in which people were averaging less than one advance per session.  That's ... that's very different from what we're doing.                        </div>

Yeah, I had that happen in my regular game, too.

This thread makes me happy. It is unmannish in the extreme to admit this, but sitting in a lonely hotel room, I read this and got teary. I can't believe you people are playing a game I wrote! I've been writin' this stuff for any soul who wants to come along and give it a try for a long while, and still - people I love and respect says that's just what they did warms my heart.                        </br></br></div>

I, too, noticed this on my first campaign (3 sessions?) My character is as changed as I thought he could get. This is probably due to bad programming on my part, being used to other games where I couldn't play a concept until well into the game and as such I didn't think of acheiving it, much more than moving beyond it.<br/><br/>TSOY has a secret joy for me that makes me feel like we're all agreeing to break 'the rules' and 'level up' like I've always wanted to in other games.                        </div>

The standard for advancement went from 10 xp/advance (old) to 5 xp/advance (new). There are some heavy-duty keys that give you 5 in one hit for doing something big. I think that was it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>The standard for advancement went from 10 xp/advance (old) to 5 xp/advance (new).</blockquote>
The cost of advances might be Judson's and my fault. I know we talked about it during playtesting.<br/><br/>If memory serves, we played about a month or two of weekly game sessions: he, me, and Clintonian running. Judson thinks we snagged about 10-15 advances total.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            Since we're talking about campaign length, how many of you played a character through to Transcendence?<br/>
<br/>
Did you bring in a new character after that or was it close to the end of the actual game?<br/>
<br/>
I am working on TSOY. Meaning, absorbing, altering, fussing, etc. The wiki-extensibility is brilliant and more games should have them "officially" connected and regulated.                        </div>

<p>Transcendance is so much just a choice.  At least at the number of advances we're pulling in over at our table, we've all got a growing crowd of skills jamming up at Master level ... and eventually we're going to say "Okay, I'm gonna bump this one up to Grand-Master and roll five bonus dice into the skill-check, because I want this character to transcend in this scene."</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure how it could happen any other way.  Other stories of paths to Transcendance?</p>

                            Yes, it seems odd that you might choose to go to Grand Master and then ... just <em>wait</em> for a lucky roll and transcendence.  But you totally could.                        </div>

<p>I'm pretty sure that you could get people to do that in a single session, if you told them that it was the priority.  Once folks are totally over Key guilt, you can pretty much generate XPs at will by making the story cooler.</p>

                            we played our first game of TSoY, kickstarting with Rat Moon Rising, planning on a one shot. We had three players with 5, 6 and 3 advances. The 5 advances character earned one by buying off a Key, but the other stuff was simply noting down XP whenever a key was struck.<br/><br/>By the way, that game rocked hard.                        </div>

                            Our current TSOY series is about to wrap up. We've had 5 sessions so far, with one to go. One player has racked up 24 advances and another has 16. Everyone else falls in between. One player got 18 XP from one action last night, which I think was a record for us (not counting buy-offs).<br/><br/>We have at least one player who will try to transcend in the final session, and given his current number of unspent advances and Master-level skills, he should be able to do so at will. Did I mention he wants to become king of the known world? Yeah.<br/><br/>TSOY rocks.                        </div>
