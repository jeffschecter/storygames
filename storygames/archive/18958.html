Feel free to respond here in-thread to another link posted.<br/><br/>a. If you're looking to start a conversation, perhaps take your comment and create a new thread with it in the Stuff to Watch category.<br/><br/>b. Otherwise, to prevent too many comments in the thread, number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. Three posts ([3]) is the limit: The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread, to carry the discussion over there further.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because these threads are great: We can link to little things being talked about on the web in general, on blogs, or other forums that might be noteworthy, without having to dedicate a new thread to each and every one (although that, too, is fine if you want to discuss the item further or "open up a discussion").<br/><br/>Responding to these posts with a comment or two is understandable (other times there might be no comments, just cause the link was self-explanatory: nothing to say, lots of heads nodding in agreement). But we don't want to create a huge discussion in the middle of the thread: Some folks get a lot out of these threads, and don't want to look back to see the "10 latest posts" just to see that it's a heated discussion of something from a previous page.<br/><br/>Cool?<br/><br/>Cool!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423624/#Comment_423624" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T13:55:38+00:00" title="November  1, 2013  1:55PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last year I wrote a comic book, and now it is finally done: <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/nathan-jones-and-johnstone-metzger/from-deep-space/paperback/product-21258714.html" rel="nofollow">From Deep Space</a>.

Unlike most D&amp;D games, however, the classes (save one) are all based on genre archetypes -- instead of combat roles. So if you wanted to play, say, a traditional Van Helsing, he's a Polymath. If you wanted to play a Peter Cushing style Van Helsing, that's a Hunter.<br/><br/>The way things are organized by archetype made it very easy to hybridize them (what most people would call multi-classing). So if you wanted a Detective Dee character, you'd start with a Polymath, add a bit of the Hunter, and finish off with the Exotic.<br/><br/>Unlike most D&amp;D games, there are classes who are very fun and useful to play but have little value in combat like the Valiant and the Polymath. There are also abilities in a few of the classes (Scoundrel, Survivor, Valiant, Hunter, and Polymath) that hand over authorial or directorial control to the players. I'm waiting for the player who combines all these abilities into one character.<br/><br/>There's more there than just classes, however. The book is loaded with tables to generate "kickoffs" (a.k.a. Kickers) for a Hammer Horror-themed adventure. What's called the "Mad Libs" section where many facets of the character's appearance, personality, and mental/emotional makeup are generated in keyword-terms reminiscent of both HeroQuest and Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>There are also tables to auto-generate an adventure with Twists and Stakes baked in. As well as what I consider "mini-games" where a group could run Investigations and determine what happens to their characters between adventures. These tables are focused on emergent play in generating results and complications that will help drive story forward in interesting ways.<br/><br/>I've run entire sessions just having groups use these tables and reacting to the results.<br/><br/>It still has many trappings of an OSR-style game. There are hit points and armor class and levels. But that decision was purposeful and the reasons are spelled out in the book. There's no magical healing (nor need for it). Armor Class is based on class, not armor. And levels are listed out in a table that details what the progression signifies in the game world. Levels function as a "story arc" for characters and parties. No other Gothic Horror-themed game really denotes what it means to have a neophyte monster hunter or exorcist versus a seasoned one. Transylvanian Adventures does.<br/><br/>For those who aren't interested in OSR. The tables are fun and useful. And make up easily half of the book. For those who are, this is a wild romp of a game. Nowhere else do I think there's a game that covers beating monsters into a bloody pulp and then going home and dealing with the post-traumatic consequences and effects on life, home, marriage, and family.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smathis" title="smathis"><img alt="smathis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smathis">smathis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423677/#Comment_423677" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T08:48:37+00:00" title="November  3, 2013  8:48AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the proofing process for the hardcover right now.

You'd need to fill in some blanks that are in DCC RPG, like what to do with Luck Points and the XP charts and all.<br/><br/>The hardest part might be scaling the classes to B/X or 1e. The classes in Transylvanian Adventures are more survivable than B/X or 1e. This allows you as the Judge/DM/GM to throw the kitchen sink at players. But if you don't have a feel for it, you'll run a risk of making things too easy on the players. I generally just up the damage output of monsters. I ran a group of Transylvanian Adventures PCs through the original Castle Ravenloft. Everything went very well. I would just bump up monster damage here and there on the fly. Once you run it once or twice, it's pretty straightforward.<br/><br/>Magic in DCC RPG is also very different. But Transylvanian Adventures magic doesn't come into its own until the third book which is still a ways off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423701/#Comment_423701" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T19:43:10+00:00" title="November  3, 2013  7:43PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u2018Garage Sale of the Damned\u2019, a horror film I\u2019ll be co-directing, is one of the 12 finalists in a contest with a $200,000 prize.

And sometimes I found it tough to evaluate where the line was between 'a cool new idea' and 'something that doesn't fit'.<br/><br/>Also: asking good questions is tough. By 'good', I mean questions that create a scary situation and keep the players engaged but that aren't too directive about what the next thing that happens in the story will be. I think I got the hang of this by two-thirds of the way through my second game: I was genuinely scared about whether I would get out of the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vanguard" title="Vanguard"><img alt="Vanguard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vanguard">Vanguard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424306/#Comment_424306" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T18:27:48+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  6:27PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryuutama looks great.

So, I set the project aside.<br/><br/>But while I was working on it I did write a lot of words. Lots of words. So, I've start posting what I'd written on a blog site. Most of them are things I wrote a couple of years ago now, I guess. <br/><br/>You can find them at <a href="http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow"><i>Play Sorcerer</i></a>.<br/><br/><br/>Here's how the site is set up. Go down to the Word Cloud Tag at the bottom of the right column:<br/><br/><i><b>Play Sorcerer</b></i> posts are the pages I wrote over the last few years. I had written each with a short, digestible word count, like a blog post, so it seems like a nice fit. They are not subdivided into further categories because: <br/>a) all the piece of Sorcerer fold into one another and sub-tagging would become weird; and <br/>b) the headers will provide the essential topic. (If it\u2019s focused on Kickers, the title will have the word \u201cKicker.\u201d) <br/>The Play Sorcerer posts are written to be read in order, staring with Play Sorcerer 1 and moving on.<br/><br/><i><b>Actual Play</b></i> posts are about Actual Plan I\u2019ve done, recounting the process of setting up or actually playing.<br/><br/><i><b>Setting</b></i> posts are settings from Actual Play, or settings I\u2019ve thought about but haven\u2019t played in yet.<br/><br/><i><b>Sorcerer &amp; Story</b></i> posts are thoughts on the intersection of the game Sorcerer and what I know about story.<br/><br/>Other specific tags (Kickers, Demons, Ritual, whatever) are posts about those topics, independent of <i>Play Sorcerer</i> posts. Usually very specific to that topic, or at least very much focused on it.<br/><br/>I'm also posting links and quotes about other matters that I've found pertinent to <i>Sorcerer</i> -- podcasts, essays, and whatnot.<br/><br/>Enjoy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424847/#Comment_424847" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T17:40:21+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  5:40PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since some of us are looking backward I wanted to let everyone know RPGNow now is giving away <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/80190/CT-ST-Starter-Traveller" rel="nofollow"><i>Starter Traveller</i> for free until Dec. 31st</a>.<br/><br/>It's a reformatted edition of the Classic <i>Traveller</i> rules published in 1983.<br/><br/>According to a user at RPGGeek, it's the Classic Traveller rules with the following changes:\n<blockquote>This streamlined box set of rules is designed to introduce new and younger players to Traveller. The books are full (8.5x11-inch) size rather than the classic Traveller digest format.<br/><br/>How does Starter Traveller differ from the full Traveller rules? The most significant difference (other than book size and organization) is in starship movement and combat. There are no vectors in Starter Traveller. Instead, combat between starships is conducted much like man-to-man combat, using range bands.<br/><br/>Missing from the rules are:<br/><br/>\u2022\xa0Archaic Firearms<br/>\u2022\xa0Ship Construction Forms (TAS Form 3: Ship's Papers, TAS Form 4: (Ship Paragraph Description), World Format (TAS Form 7: Subsector Data)<br/>\u2022\xa0Experience<br/>\u2022\xa0Drugs<br/><br/>Newly added:<br/><br/>\u2022\xa0Expanded information on the following encounters: wirebushes, cold snap, tornado, volcano, radiation area, quicksand.<br/>\u2022\xa0Expanded descriptions of the following equipment: handcuffs, wristwatch, shotgun microphone, chainsaw, disguise kit, wheeled AFV, tracked AFV, dirtmover, small steamship, destroyer.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cybrasty" title="cybrasty"><img alt="cybrasty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cybrasty">cybrasty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424849/#Comment_424849" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T18:33:25+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  6:33PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an act of shameless self-promotion I would like to tell you guys about <a href="http://level27geek.blogspot.com/search/label/HEI%24T_ACES" rel="nofollow">HEI$T_ACES</a> -
