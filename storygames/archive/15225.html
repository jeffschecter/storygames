I still do this sometimes (just did it last night with Play Unsafe, in fact - downloaded, took a look, paid for it it, continued reading the pirated PDF), but these days I'll usually pay up front for indie stuff. For mainstream shit I download first and usually buy if/when I actually end up using it (if it's still in print). Sometimes I'll do the reverse - I'll buy a hard copy then download a pirate PDF if it doesn't come for free. The idea of paying extra for a PDF of something I own doesn't sit right with me.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I have a pirated copy of Dogs in the Vineyard I got at the same time as IAWA and MG sitting on my hard drive that I've never read or paid for.

I have never knowingly downoaded anything I was supposed to pay for as far as RPGs goes. I have known too many designers for too many years to ever feel cavalier enough to disrespect them in that way. I presume you're specifically asking after illegally downloaded games; I can certainly foresee the possibility I'd try out a free beta,or a PDF made available by the author ala Misspent Youth before buying a print copy, it just hasn't worked out that way for me because of the relatively unrestricted access I have to print stuff.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346362/#Comment_346362" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T03:40:53+00:00" title="October 18, 2011  3:40AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to say that I have and I am totally in favour of it, but when I look back at my own history, I think that everything that I have downloaded (which then led to a hardcopy purchase) was legal or that I even bought the PDF and then paid for the hardcopy.

I hate reading on PDFs so I've never done it for RPGs. I've gotten a couple of PDFs of RPGs, but there wasn't much connection to buying afterwards. I had already decided to buy, or decided I wouldn't buy and the PDF didn't sway me (mostly because I only skimmed random pages because I can't stand to read them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346491/#Comment_346491" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-19T19:03:07+00:00" title="October 19, 2011  7:03PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything freely available on "Anyway"  was downloaded.<br/>Then bought.<br/>Then I bought everything not freely available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rune" title="Rune"><img alt="Rune" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rune">Rune</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346524/#Comment_346524" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T05:37:27+00:00" title="October 20, 2011  5:37AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to admit that I do this all the time, a few games that come to mind as I'm writing are Eclipse Phase (later purchased rules + several sourcebooks), Mouse Guard (bought both the HC and now the boxed set), 3:16 CAtS, and Burning Wheel. I also downloaded Shock:Social Sci-fi, which later made me buy both a physical copy of the game, but also pledge towards the Shock:Human Contact kickstarter. Sometimes I don't even read through the pdf's but look at certain interesting parts before deciding if I will purchase (and I often do, I buy way to many rpg's), a bit similar to thumbing through a book in the store.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
