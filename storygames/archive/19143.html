Some further notes:<br/><br/>1. The room with the pillar is fairly complicated and I did not understand it on first quick read.<br/><br/>2. The dungeon seems to attempt to tell a specific story, with the countdown only starting when characters are close to the ritual, and with secret doors one can only open from specific direction or which are easy to find from the other one. This makes the dungeon fairly linear (not entirely, which is good). I'd rather have the countdown start when the characters realise the situation, in order to make their decisions on moving swiftly or waiting more important.<br/><br/>3. The bolded text is common and makes reading the adventure slightly uncomfortable. It might very well be useful in play, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alvan" title="Alvan"><img alt="Alvan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alvan">Alvan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427534/#Comment_427534" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T06:01:40+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  6:01AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked the bolded text approach for highlighting what is important in the room. Very useful for creating the room description from the cues. The distraction with that was that the same bolded text was used for mechanical things like hps and saving throws and such, which diminishes the benefit of the bold text tags for me somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427537/#Comment_427537" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T06:33:35+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  6:33AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The premise is fair and well-phrased. The room description paradigm is good (I like the minimalistic monster stat lines), although the incessant bolding of nouns grows tiresome - the conceit would serve better if used with less frequency. The causal movement of hostile NPCs is documented reasonably - too often you see people miss the necessity of describing where a NPC might or might not move in both the staging and target area descriptions.<br/><br/>The setpiece encounter in room <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a> is a black mark in my book; I would prefer for the ritual to have an objective timeline instead of having it be finished just as the PCs get there. (If it seems pointless to have a timeline for something the players know nothing about, well, perhaps some info could be dropped in advance.) I'm sure that there are many others for whom it's worth the cost in consequential play to make sure that the PCs get to be there for the cool stuff. (I'm the sort of GM who has quite willingly run through several sessions of an ultimately pointless dungeon long after the bird has flown the coop, trusting that the players would want me to let them make their own mistakes. I recognize that this is a somewhat extremist viewpoint.)<br/><br/>All in all, quite reasonable. I would use this. Will in fact save this in my lil' folder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%C3%BCrgen_Mayer" title="J\xfcrgen_Mayer"><img alt="J\xfcrgen_Mayer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/003/nFGPS2DQNTF7U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%C3%BCrgen_Mayer">J\xfcrgen_Mayer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428150/#Comment_428150" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-10T00:30:11+00:00" title="February 10, 2014 12:30AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am myself a bit unhappy with how I described the timing of the ritual. A better approach would probably be to have the characters find out "there's something going on in the old temple in 3 hours" and then take it from there.<br/><br/>I'll take a note about the bolded text - it was the first time I tried it. I wanted to make the text better usable for the GM during play. I'll try to just use it only for the main descriptors of the rooms next time (and not for mechanics).<br/><br/>I'm not sure if a random table is needed for a dungeon of this size. I think the time pressure of the imminent ritual should be enough. However, some kind of random rumors table for the characters might be a good idea.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the helpful suggestions! I'll try to improve when writing my next module.
