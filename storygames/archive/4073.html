Some systems, as Shreyas says, are all about "faster, harder, more violent!"  But not all.<br/><i><br/>Primetime Adventures</i> is opened ended in this regard.  Fan Mail is rewarded for -- well, anything that hits another player's fancy. If you take the time to establish the <i>focus</i> of the content up front, it should help people get on the same page for delivering that kind of content.<br/><br/>Bonus dice in <i>Sorcerer</i>, likewise, can be awarded for <i>anything</i>.  Describing how the PC is remembering the murder of his son as he draws his gun, focusing on a simply touch in an encounter between two PCs (I'm thinking here of the moment in <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> when Lector is in the big iron barred cell and she passes him the files and he touches her fingers lightly -- the first human contact in years.)  <br/><br/>I"m sure there are others, but it's 6 in the morning for me right now.  But the key is, at least these two systems can easily reward the quiet, the half-spoken. Remember, we're out of the land of Players Only Speak in Character, so you can lay out the dialogue and then add, "But all he's thinking is that he doesn't want her to leave."<br/><br/>I'm not sure I'm seeing your concern about being "noticed."  If someone points at you and says, "What's your guy do?" at that moment everyone is going to notice what you're doing. Right? I mean, it's not a matter of not being "noticed." People at the table might not <i>care</i>.  But that's a completely different issue. <br/><br/>As Matthijs points out, establish style and genre as a focus. And if you need to pull focus when your turn comes, take the time to set it up and see if you sell it well and get the reward from the group. Also, think more in terms of the "internal life" of the character found in novels, and less in terms cinema and comics books -- which usually reveal life only through external deeds.<br/><br/>There's no guarantee you'll get the reward, of course. But, again, as Matthhijs points out, that comes down to the players and the set up for the game.<br/><br/>If this has been a problem, can you give specific examples? Or is this one of those times where the human brain starts worrying about something that <i>could</i> happen, instead of just pressing forward and seeing what happens?<br/><br/>CK<br/><br/>PS a tangent from some cross-posting from the last few posts:<br/><br/>On the matter of system: There's a trend growing/coming down the road, in my view, where the rules of reward are so clearly spelled out as to guarantee there's never miscommunication, disappointment or lack of clarity about what is good. <br/><br/>While I admire the impulse, to me, it's like asking all the participants to wear foam padding suits at the table. It starts removing the risk of creative endeavour from the players.  And that risk is, in my view, one of the things that makes Narrativist play Narritivist play.  (Some folks don't care about Narrativist play, and I know and respect that, so please know I'm not schooling you to play Narrativist play; I'm saying what I like about a certain kind of play.)<br/><br/>Just as in Gamist play the competition is, "Will I successfully use these rules to win?" in Narrtivist play it's, "Will I use the tools and techniques of story well to reveal what matters to me?"  If there's no risk -- if we're all wearing foam padded suits -- I'm just not that interested. It takes the sport of it out.<br/><br/>That's why I specifically referenced <i>PtA</i> and <i>Sorcerer</i>.  In both cases the reward comes from nothing more than the group -- instinctively, as audience members and peers -- responding to the <i><b>whatever the fuck causes aesthetic pleasure</b></i> that makes us go, "Yeah, that was good."<br/><br/>So, it's a function of system.  But not a completely, "Here, do this and you get and extra die," kind of system.<br/><br/>To each his own.  But I wanted to point that out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90909/#Comment_90909" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T06:29:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  6:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Tony, it's not about noticing at all.

That is, if we were playing <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, he's not getting Fan Mail from me.  The details are lacking, the "sell" isn't there.  Ed's making a play at <i>something</i> -- but it's not clear, not particularly creative.  It clearly means something to <i>Ed</i> -- and I buy that.  But Tony's point is Rachel is supposed to notice/care.  And all I can say is, Ed needs to find a way of phrasing the beat with more poignancy/impact/something.<br/><br/>Just because we think something is important doesn't mean that importance we've <i>communicated</i> that importance to other people at the table.  Fan Mail in PtA is all about that -- did your peers <i>get</i> it.  <br/><br/>Sure, sometimes the joke or the fun-bit-of-violence is (maybe) easier to get the the Fan Mail for.  But why is that?  Is it because that's what this group responds to?  Is it because a kick-to-the nuts is easier to communicate than a soulful moment?  There are a ton of questions to be asked here.  <br/><br/>In Tony's example, Rachel apparently is only focused on fighting.  She got what she got from Ed's plaintiff sigh.  Okay.  In one view, that's fine.  But Tony, I'm assuming, is assuming that Ed is disappointed that Rachel is only interested in taking his character's plaintiff sigh as a kick off for a charge.  Not only does her character apparently miss the beat, but so does Rachel.  And that, apparently is a problem.<br/><br/>My other question is: Why is this a problem?  Ed has his moment.  As Tony points out, no one's going to notice everything.  So, why is he carrying around his disappointment Rachel didn't get more from it?  I mean that.  Really, what's the deal?  <br/><br/>And all I can say is, if Ed really wants to turn the direction at the table ("how the session hits us") he must make that beat clear.  Right now, not clear.<br/><br/>Unsubtle fictional counter-example:<br/><br/>In <i>The Iliad</i>, when a character is cut down outside the walls of Troy, Homer often does this quick flashback, where he'll describe how the character was raised by his mother and father.  He describe how the character, as a boy, played with his dad, and how he laid his head in his mother's lap.  And then he'll describe how the father is already dead and the mother will never have her son lay his head in her lap again.  And then we cut back to the kid hitting the ground outside the walls of Troy.<br/><br/>Now, in my view, if Ed wants to actually get the group onboard with his sigh, he's going to have to unpack it if he wants people to notice it. He's going to have to do some work and not expect everyone to just come along for the ride because he means well and he's doing something emotional and significant.<br/><br/>I means, describing, in that sigh, what his childhood was like with his PC's brother.  It means eliciting incidents that have impact on the other players at the table. It means grabbing the reigns of the narrative for a moment or two and <i>earning</i> the Fan Mail.<br/><br/>We often think people should give us our dues because we mean well or something is a good idea.  But in fact we have to communicate it and make it clear.<br/><br/>Ed might have his guy sigh -- but I don't know what that means.  It's an indication of something, obviously. But it's a blip. <br/><br/>The issue is not about the "size" of the moment.  It's about the clarity, the specifics and the drama of the moment through concrete details. <br/><br/>Is Ed willing to put himself out there and take a risk to have the other players come along with him through some clear, creative effort.  Because, as it stands in the fictional example, I'm not surprised Rachel rode over that moment.  Give me a Homeric flashback.  Give me a St. Crispin's Day speech.  Give me Ed's character drawing his sword, and have Ed describe his character remembering how the two brother's once promised, when they got the swords as boys to go on adventures together.  Give me something concrete and detailed and clear -- or just give me the damned fight.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90927/#Comment_90927" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T07:30:22+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:30AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why are people reading Tony's example as <i>negative</i>?

Shreyas's comment is a bit straw.<br/><br/>To catch up, if I get what Tony's on about in his example, he's asking "how can Ed get Rachel to respond to the <i>subtext</i> in his cue (reluctance and regret) rather than the <i>overt</i> cue (time to fight), given that every cue is inevitably going to contain multiple layers of meaning?"<br/><br/>The thing is, Rachel's response is multivalent too. Is she offering her character as a foil in the conflict between Tommy &amp; Hoshi, so Tommy can stand between her and his brother? Or is she missing the cue and spoiling for a fight? Or is she actively turning down Ed's overture towards "reluctance" as a tone for the fight?<br/><br/>The problem is fundamentally one of communication. It's not about "loud", per se. It's about being able to hit the target when it's not 40 feet high and on fire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90943/#Comment_90943" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T07:53:45+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:53AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>The problem is fundamentally one of communication.

While, of course there's a lot to be said about technique, Tony's looking for mechanics, I believe, and I think that it's doable. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Universalis, in fact, during development, we at one point had a mechanic to meter out progress of plots. You created a plot idea, and then put in X amount of coins into that plot, and then when they were gone, the plot ended. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn't a good mechanic, so that's why it's not in the game anymore. But it's indicative of what you can do to meter out events. Basically have something be like, for lack of a better term, "long-term stakes." And then, like saving in your 401K, people invest toward it's end. If you try to withdraw the results too early, you get a "substantial penalty." If you will. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's good about this is that the player can choose to rush to a conclusion if he feels that it's neccessary by making the decision to burn the extra rewards he'd get by otherwise waiting. This makes each decision on the path one with a mechanical repercussion, informing the decisions all along the path. You'll tend to get longer paths to results, but, where especially appropriate, you'll get the quick dramatic conclusion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can even spike this by making it a "Tragedy of the Commons" situation. That is, say you have a pool for a certain outcome building, where it goes up by the number of scenes played, each scene (so at the end of the first you have 1, at the end of the second 1+2 = 3, at the end of the third 1+2+3 = 6, etc). Any player can take the pool at any time by moving to resolution. But, of course, the longer you wait, the larger the reward. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought. Adding rewards to incentivize moving to a resolution over time can be thought of as the "Puerto Rico Prospector" method. Doing so with penalties for early withdrawal can be called the 401K method. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90958/#Comment_90958" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T08:24:57+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  8:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh. Nice, Mike. I was just reading <i>It Was A Mutual Decision</i> this morning, so I was thinking of the Rat Dice in that game and how they work as both pacing and tone indicators. I wonder if IWaMD would make a good exercise for building these gaming-muscles, actually: there's good signalling and dials in the mechanics, and the "team play" consensus thing might drive more discussion of <i>why</i> I want to do X rather than Y in this scene. Speaking from <b>zero</b> actual play experience here, though, so Probably Talking Out My Ass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90974/#Comment_90974" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T08:39:30+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  8:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Basically, the crazier the situation gets, the bigger the stress factor, and the bigger the penalties that accrue. If the game is meant to model average joes in extraordinary situations, is makes sense that they're going to freak out when things go crazy. Personally, I'm not one for having mechanics with such a deep hook in PC behavior, but it could definitely work, especially if the players feel like I do. Avoiding the stress enhancing situations becomes a way to avoid the stress mechanic, and therefor maintain constant control over their character.<br/><br/>The mechanic could also work just with penalties due to stress, without going all out and having character behavior dictated to te player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90987/#Comment_90987" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T09:19:53+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  9:19AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When play is cranked up to 11 it's about the future.

I'm inviting you to invest in what I care about. Please do."<br/><br/>What Tony was asking about was a moment in the narrative, an incident that gives specific color or emotional impact to a specific character that the Player wants to make sure hits the table.  I might be reading it wrong, but I didn't get the impression form the example Tony offered Ed needed Rachel to grab his character's Sigh, and run with it so much as notice it and let the moment be colored by it for a moment.<br/><br/>To me there's a similarity, but also a difference.  A Pull seemed to suggest something long term (though not always present), where as what Tony is asking about is perhaps short term but <i>very</i> present for all the players when presented.<br/><br/>But I might be misreading (both Pull and Tony's comments) -- and await Tony's response to the ton of material that's been thrown at the wall.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91147/#Comment_91147" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T18:11:16+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  6:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow guys ... that's a lot of responses!

Give me Ed's character drawing his sword, and have Ed describe his character remembering how the two brother's once promised, when they got the swords as boys to go on adventures together. Give me something concrete and detailed and clear -- or just give me the damned fight.</blockquote>In other words, I think you're saying, turn the volume up to eleven.  That's definitely one solution, but it's not really the one I'm aiming for.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>If you make the loud, gonzo, and over-the-top actions painfully dangerous then people are more likely to look for alternative outs. People avoid gunfights when the rules are set up so that only 5% of people that enter one end it without being maimed or dead. Likewise if it's impossible to start with the amount of driving skill necessary to pilot your motorcycle up a spiral staircase, people are more likely to stick to the road.</blockquote>I agree with your premise, but your examples aren't about loud or gonzo, they're about certain types of situations which often (but not always) correlate with loud and gonzo.  Let me assure you, people can make <i>bowling</i> so loud and gonzo that you'd be astonished.  If I just try to punish the situation, what I suspect it'll do is to push the gonzo into other situations (since getting attention is still a good thing).<br/><br/>Now if I actually punished attention-seeking behavior ... uh ... wow, that'd be wierd.  I'm not sure what that would do.  It would still draw attention to the attention-seeking behaviors, and that might be enough for some people.  It'd be enough for me ... even if the attention came along with negative consequences.<br/><br/>Oh, that would be cute.  Perhaps for a different game though.<br/><br/>I wonder if one could penalize not for <i>being loud</i>, but for running over quieter material.  Like, actually penalize people for talking over someone else's "thing."  That'd be hard to pull off, though.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>It's about being able to hit the target when it's not 40 feet high and on fire.</blockquote>I love that description.  That's exactly how I feel about it, only better than I could express.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>What's good about this is that the player can choose to rush to a conclusion if he feels that it's neccessary by making the decision to burn the extra rewards he'd get by otherwise waiting. This makes each decision on the path one with a mechanical repercussion, informing the decisions all along the path. You'll tend to get longer paths to results, but, where especially appropriate, you'll get the quick dramatic conclusion.</blockquote>Yeah.  Pacing is definitely part of it.  The other thing (which I wrestle with more) is actually just <i>quieting down</i> the individual exchanges.  <br/><br/>Hypothetical:  Suppose Hiro confesses his love to Sylvie, and we have a whole plot going on about Sylvie being unable to be vulnerable to someone else since her terrible break-up.  If we're in the middle of that plot (i.e. Sylvie is <b>not</b> going to reciprocate Hiro's feelings) we can still have a loud version (where she barely holds back tears, slaps him in frustration, and runs away, dropping books and cherry-blossoms in her wake) and we can have a quiet version (where she just blushes, and vaguely stammers, and totally flubs things, and Hiro is insecure enough to interpret that as a rejection).<br/><br/>Like the violent situations above:  I think that <i>resolving</i> a conflict is often loud, and sustaining it is often (at least comparatively) quiet, but they don't need to be ... and when you're doing a reward system that is driven by what the players <i>notice</i>, I've found that people will sustain their conflicts in a very loud way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>When play is cranked up to 11 it's about the future.

I don't need the <i>character</i> to sit up and pay attention (though I think they might) so much as I need a chance for the players to pay attention to something that's not (in Mark's wonderful words) forty feet high and on fire.<br/><br/><br/>So ... the executive summary of "What do I want"?  I want techniques, but better yet <i>mechanics</i> that will help to get everyone at the table together on paying attention to small things.  Not all small things, not all the time ... but give small, subtle details a sporting chance in the face of the tendency for attention-driven rewards to encourage the loud and the gonzo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91155/#Comment_91155" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T18:51:11+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  6:51PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A technique I have when I'm a traditional GM to signal that the scene should be introspective, relationship-oriented within the player character group, or similar, is to stand up and leave the room and go make coffee or whatnot.<br/><br/>That means that there is literally only one game in town for players - each other.<br/><br/>This is a really specific technique, though.<br/><br/>Tony, this seems similar to what you've been talking about for months with "silence rules"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91171/#Comment_91171" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T19:48:37+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:48PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 7:49PM by TonyLB.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD:  Yeah, I hadn't thought about it, but the silence-rules would apply to this.

Maybe a 12.<br/><br/>Remembering the fair haired boy laying his head on his mother's lap is a 12?  Well, it's taken me a while, but I think I know what you're going for here.<br/><br/>My question is: Why?  Not in a what the fuck is wrong with you kind of way.  But in a, "Well, it seems to me you're taking the responsibility of making the beat clear off the person who's creating the beat, and hoping that a) people notice, and b) they mind-read the intention the gesture correctly."<br/><br/>And for me... that's missing the boat.  Now, it's just me, but I'm going to explicate in case it helps.<br/><br/>Rule number one for me when writing fiction: Be Clear. If I have something I want the audience to <i>get</i>, I make sure it's clear.  Why hide it?  I want them to get it, right?  If it matters to me, why not use any trick in the book to make it clear?  This doesn't mean just coming out having a character say it -- although sometimes it does.<br/><br/>It does mean, however, no mind reading on the part of the reader or audience member.<br/><br/>In fact, after reading your example above, I now know that if I ever write a book on screenwriting, it's going to be called, "A Sigh is Not Enough."  Because I read all these scripts where the writers' have not done their job of making something clear enough.  I'll say, "So, um, what's this moment here, where he looks at his sister in the middle of the fight and sighs."  And the writer says, "Well, that's all the tension they've built up for years, and he's just tired of it."  And I'm like, "Can you put some clues in there."  And the always say, "The actor will do the job with sigh."  And I always say, "No they won't, cause there's no clarity there yet."<br/><br/>It is, as they say in Town, "It's gotta be on the page."<br/><br/>Again.  I'm not talking about putting everything on the nose.  I'm talking about matching up specific words/images/gestures to produce a specific act of communication.<br/><br/>All successful scenes in movies depend on this.  Novels, too.<br/><br/>Now you might be going for something I'm missing.  But as it stands, your agenda seems to be trying to commit an act of communication <i>without calling attention to the act of communication</i>.  Which I just don't get.

You automatically succeed at your crime, be it stealing patterned fabric from the tailor or burning down the Chief Inspector's home. For some people, this is big incentive to go big or go home, because your crime will always succeed regardless of difficulty or scope. For others, it takes the "Oh, I have to play to the hilt" edge off, surprisingly. I think that this is because when you give limits to what's achievable, people will always push for achieving those limits. When you widen the playing field and say "do whatever you want, just make it matter to your character" then you end up seeing some really low key and personal crime rather than crazy-gonzo-all-the-time.<br/><br/>That said, the phenomenon I most often see is escalation, escalation, gonzo escalation, totally low-key counterpoint that brings everything down to a really symbolic level all over again. Rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>For example: someone steals a locket from an ex-lover (low key). someone busts into an art gallery and replaces a sanctioned painting with their own (unsanctioned) work (pretty big). someone torches a building for revenge (big). someone puts the bible back into print and circulation (crazy gonzo!). someone breaks curfew to deliver a love poem to a girl he's never introduced himself to (low key).<br/><br/>The juxtaposition between epic gonzo and understated simplicity that exists within game sessions of Perfect is great.<br/><br/>Now, how is this dealt with in a more mechanical sense?<br/><br/>Well, the economy of the scene (how many points the GM gets to spend, what the reward level will be, what the consequences might be) is all determined by two questions the GM asks... one of the player and one of himself.<br/><br/>Question to the player: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much does this matter to your character?<br/>Question to oneself: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much does this upset the balance of society?<br/><br/>So if you say 6 and I say 9, I combine the two and have a total of 15 points to spend on adversity this scene.<br/><br/>The important thing about the questions is that they don't address scope or magnitude of a crime. Sneaking out after dark to see the lunar eclipse might be a 10 for a character. Torching the Inspector's Yard building might be a 4.  Similarly, maybe you marking your grey suit with an undetectably subtle pink tint would totally earn you a 10 from the society if I were GMing that game. Killing a man? Well, that could be anywhere from a 4 to a 10, depending on who and why.<br/><br/>The mechanics give even playing field to setting the dials at 4 or 11, in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91248/#Comment_91248" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T05:07:49+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  5:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>I asked the question not say, "What the hell's your problem?" but to tease out the purpose.

Say, I'm playing Hiro and during the scene I have him sigh for some important reason and I want to draw attention to that fact.  After narrating, I drop a token down in the center of the table.  One of the other players can then pick the Token up if they narrate something that draws attention to or focuses on my "sigh" (or whatever it was I wanted emphasized).  They can't narrate something gonzo as that would draw attention away from the quiet action.  The player that took the Token and helped focus the attention could then exchange it for a small bonus to a later action or some other sort of reward.<br/><br/>Obviously since I'm not totally familiar with your game in process, the suggestion above is kinda vague.

(History tells me I frequently am.)  But I'm curious about one thing: Are you looking for subtlety in the story or subtlety at the gaming table?  <br/><br/>If it is the former, it seems to me, that Ed's problem is that the subtlety of his story element has been lost because he is playing in a system that does not allow a subtle story point to be not-so-subtle at the table.  If he had a chip to plunk down, a die to roll, or a card to play, or whatever that said "I define this as an important moment for me," it wouldn't necessarily stop Rachel from going gonzo if she was inclined to do so, but it would be a good way to at least give her a clear signal.<br/><br/>On top of this, if that move required even a minor moment of "system" it would mandate a pause in the game.  System action often slows down pace in a game, and in this case that would be a feature instead of a bug.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure if this is in line with where you were going, but it was my initial reaction.<br/><br/>(Damn!

The music stops or changes, the camera focuses closely on the character, we get a shot of the glance, then a closeup of the sigh, then the shake, then a longshot in which his words are the only things we can hear. In a manga we'd get 7 different frames for all of this before the big one where the fight starts. In other words the quiet moment gets a huge frame around it so that we can't possibly miss how important it is. Its like a little drawing in an art gallery, which almost always gets a huge white mount around it, so that even from a distance we can see that there is something there, even if its far smaller than the 10 by 10 oil painting next to it. (The other gallery option is to put the little pictures in a room of their own, where they are all big compared to each other, but that's a quiet scene full of quiet moments, which is different.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do you get all that framing on the gaming table? One option is clearly to use system to do it. When you lay down the card, or chip, or spend a point you are saying to everyone "Look, this moment is important to me, and I think it should be to you as well, now pay attention". <i>then</i> you get to pause, wait a moment, and introduce your poignant moment. In this case System is like all the movie tricks, giving importance to something that can't command attention by itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative is just to tell the other players, as an aside, or out of character, that this is important. Your fellow players, after all, are just human. They aren't inside your head, knowing what matters to you, and your gaming table probably doesn't come with a score, and close in camera angles. Sometimes their just going to miss things, just as they miss the fact that someone was trying to take a combat action before them, or that you had to pop to the loo when they weren't looking. So if you don't have rules to make it obvious that this little moment really counts for something, you can always tell them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93130/#Comment_93130" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T07:04:28+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  7:04AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you've outlined <i>one</i> system option:  "I pay attention to a quiet moment that I create, and then I use the rules to make other people pay attention to it."<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about another option:  "I pay attention to a quiet moment that <i>someone else</i> creates, and then I use the rules to communicate that I paid attention to it."<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the rules can be set up in such a way that people are encouraged to pay attention to the quiet stuff ... even the quiet stuff that the player creating it <i>wasn't</i> paying attention to.

It was a beautiful pacing mechanism, and while it wasn't explicitly about turning down the volume, there was a beautiful tone structure development going on too.<br><br/>Don't know what happened to the designer or design though.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94522/#Comment_94522" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T20:10:55+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  8:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, been thinking about this a little lately, and haven't responded back until I got my head around it.<br/><br/>As a GM (and as a fellow player) I've used social cues and stuff to "accentuate Ed" in Tony's example.<br/><br/>GM:  Okay, Ed, your character's older brother Hoshi has an army of mind-controlled freshman, and is going to destroy the school.  What's your guy do?<br/>Ed:  Tommy looks at Hoshi, opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again and shakes his head.  "We've come too far," he sighs.  "The only thing left now is war."  He lifts his sword.<br/>Rachel:  ALRIGHT!  Finally some action!  I've been itching to use my 'Punch him in the brains!' skill all evening!<br/>Andy (as fellow player): Hold up a sec, Rach... I think he's going somewhere with this. Let's see what Hoshi responds with.<br/><br/>Then Rachel does one of two things:<br/>1) This ALWAYS happens. In fact, it happened this weekend when I employed this technique (admittedly as GM) in a Tenra game where we started jumping ahead"<br/>Rachel: Oh, shit, yeah. Heh, I didn't see that. (socially "takes a step back"). Yeah, how does Hoshi respond to that?<br/><br/>2) Or:<br/>Rachel: (pouts) Damn, I was hoping to get my Combat off.<br/>Andy: Heh, well Ed, what do you think?<br/>Ed: Fine with me!<br/>Andy: OK, shit, it's on!  Take it away, GM!<br/><br/>3) Or (variation off of immediate above):<br/>Rachel: (pouts) Damn, I was hoping to get my Combat off.<br/>Andy: Heh, well Ed, what do you think?<br/>Ed: Well, I reeeeeeally wanted to see where this would go first. Maybe we'll get to a fight, but I want to play this out for a sec first.<br/>Rachel: *sighs*<br/>Ed: *sighs*<br/>Andy: Hmmm.<br/>And then we get caught in a situation where having mechanics in place could or couldn't have lubricated this issue. But we have a social issue we'll have to figure out as people anyway.<br/><br/>But again, in actual play, I've seen it (from systems like The Riddle of Steel, The Shadow of Yesterday, Polaris (!), With Great Power, etc) ALWAYS play out like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, and never to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> or <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. The "turning down" was needed because of a problem of perception, namely one player jumping ahead, without understanding the player's intent.<br/><br/>I've even been Rachel. Frex, in our current With Great Power game, I've at least 2-3 times in about 6 sessions jumped in screaming:<br/>GM: <b>Conflict!</b><br/>Matthew: ...Um, I'm just not feeling it.<br/>or<br/>Matthew: What's at stake?<br/>GM: ... ... ...uh... Well, you guys seem opposed right now... Tell you what, keep on going and let's see what happens.<br/>(scene resolves, without conflict)<br/><br/>In a way, me as GM jumping in to find conflict was just as "jumpy ahead" as the Rachel above trying to get to the fight scene.  When I backed up and realized that everyone was on the same page <i>But Me</i>, it was easy to say, "*Oh*, yeah my bad. Continue!"<br/><br/>Again, though, that's all social stuff. Well, a piece of social advice you could write down, and thus codifying it into a "rule" without having a Number or Mechanic attached.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94547/#Comment_94547" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T21:50:58+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Tony,<br/><br/>I've got this thing, this idea bouncing around in my brain.  You know how DitV gives mechanical weight to words by assigning dice to them?  Like, words can be stronger than guns in that world?  Ok, so what if we had a system that gave weight to "Something Implied".  Your character shrugs his shoulders and turns his back on my character.  He's not saying anything.  He's avoiding saying things.  He's implying.  That's step 1.<br/><br/>Step 2 is communicating, player to player, that your character is hitting me with the weight of his implications.  I wanna know that this is a clear situation.  I mean, if I call down the katana-rockets after just plain missing the implication, well that won't be awesome for anyone.  But then, the communication between you and I should probably be quiet too, right?  Hand signals might work.  I've got this image in my head of us having a small selection of thought-bubbles on sticks that we can quietly hold up to our temples.  That would be cool.<br/><br/>Step 3 is to reward me for "Interpreting Implied Things".  Ok, so you've hit me with your quiet gunshot of implication.  The only way I can respond to your character's implication, without suffering the consequences of the mechanical weight of your implication, is to make an interpretation.  Not necessarily a correct interpretation.  Any interpretation.  Then maybe my character gets to steal the mechanical weight you levered when you brought down the implication.  Or something.  I can't help but imagine that one player's interpretation of another player's quiet implication will also be quiet.  Subdued.  <br/><br/>Now Rachel gets to know what you're up to while you're doing it, can consider that you're willing to reward and/or punish her for responding or failing to respond.  Not only that, but if Rachel starts punching people in the brain at that moment, you can know that she didn't miss what you were doing, she just chose to respond to it differently than you wanted her to.  Which I imagine will be way more satisfying than assuming she just didn't hear what you were saying between the lines.<br/><br/>-Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94553/#Comment_94553" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T22:35:13+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Ok, so what if we had a system that gave weight to "Something Implied".
