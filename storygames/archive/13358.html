It takes time to whittle off Survival Points, and this seems to run counter to the idea of sudden, brutal death.  The scenario suggests:\n<blockquote>Play up the gratuitous gore, with Survival Point loss representing the deaths of other (non-player) residents, the victims stumbling into traps and the general loss of limbs and blood.</blockquote>\nThis would seem to suggest that Survival Points lost can be lost somehow indirectly.  But how else are they going to be lost except in direct conflict with the killer?  Do we interrupt the kill scene with the PC in order to narrate someone else's death?  It doesn't make sense to me, but maybe I'm just not getting the how and why Survival Points are lost in general.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301059/#Comment_301059" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T17:44:27+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  5:44PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What the text means to say is that you roll dice as normal for the conflict, but then once it comes time to deduct the points from the character's score, you narrate something else instead of the character getting killed. This "something else" is basically pacing: instead of just declaring the character dead you declare wounds, shock, horrible revelations, other people getting killed and other such colorful flourish. There is no intent of a formal rule here for a separate monologue scene or anything like that, the text just acknowledges the fact that the survival point rules as a pacing device override any specific declaration of intent on the part of the characters: if somebody has survival points, you can't kill them yet.<br/><br/>Other games that pace in-fiction goals with mechanics usually approach the task in this same way, so there isn't anything going on here that wouldn't be familiar to you from before. It's the same as D&amp;D, really: you have your hitpoints, and the conflict needs to continue as long as you have those, so what we do to pass time between dice rolls is excess narration. This narration is pretty freeform as long as it doesn't mess with the actual game mechanics, but it is still consequential in a curiously circuituous way: fictional positioning, leverage and conflict stakes can change as rounds of dicing and narration happen.<br/><br/>Reading your suggestion, I should emphasize that the idea of that text is not that a character somehow loses survival points indirectly. You still only lose points when an otherwise successful kill attempt is averted by the loss of the survival point. What that text is trying to communicate is simply that even an averted death is still a source of narration as the players describe how the character was "almost killed" by the monster. As part of this pacing narration others can die, the character can get injured and so on.<br/><br/>As an example of how this narration is informal but consequential, I remember how once when we played Dead of Night a player character was trapped by the slasher in a room on the second floor of the building, with their car parked outside. The first roll was over whether the character could slip around the slasher and dash out of the room. The second was over whether they could get down the stairs without the slasher catching them. The third was whether they could get the car going before the slasher got to them. I seem to remember that the PC basically lost all rolls except for the last; this did not actually change anything much in the fiction aside from the PC getting horribly described, grim and heartless injuries as she was stabbed, thrown down the stairs and so on. The basic question is, why did this scene have three rolls over this matter before the character escaped the scene and it ended with the character alive (as opposed to dead as a doornail, which was my goal as the GM at the time)? The simple answer is that the fictional narration between the "rounds" of conflict established and re-established positioning of the characters in the action, and this positioning progressively determined when and how the scene would end. Individual rounds of survival point loss were described as the game prescribes, in a freeform manner and as part of the on-going action narrative.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I would consider the fact that your character can't get killed in a sudden, brutal manner as long as you have survival points to be the entire point of the survival point mechanic. That's pretty much the only certainty the players have in the game, taking it away would be entirely wrong; survival points would lose their value as a currency were this elegant requirement not there. As long as you have a survival point or several, the monster needs at least two strikes against you to kill you dead, and therefore you can have at least some dramatic confidence in the idea that your character is going to enter a ghost house all alone; if he didn't have those survival points, that's one of the signals for how the story is almost over, and perhaps you should just run as fast as you can. This is a feature even with slashers; if you want a simple and quick kill for your mythical killer, don't go after a character with survival points - they have the right to a close escape, or at least an attempt at one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301107/#Comment_301107" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T05:39:12+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  5:39AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Reading your suggestion, I should emphasize that the idea of that text is not that a character somehow loses survival points indirectly.

Maybe I'm misreading it and Andrew can clarify once he weighs in on the thread.  He said he would do so today sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301109/#Comment_301109" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T05:44:23+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  5:44AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that sounds just weird.

Therefore, whenever a survival point is lost, the PC is a step closer to being out of the story. <br/><br/>That's the mechanical reasoning. How the fiction interacts with that is entirely up to you. So, the survival point loss could be justified in the fiction as anything that puts that character closer to death. In a traditional slasher game, this will be things like getting hurt by the monster, getting cornered and so on.<br/><br/>But, in something like 28 Days Later, it can't be getting hurt, as that's pretty much the end. So instead things that put you closer to death are losing your ammo, getting trapped, setting a car alarm off or losing your companions so next time the zombies come, you're next.<br/><br/>Likewise in the example of Vorkuta Block 9 (the splatter horror). Splatter horror is all about violent, messy deaths, but the PCs can suffer a violent death straight away, right? they've still got survival points left. So instead things that put them closer to death are their fellow inhabitants dying in their stead so they're next in line.<br/><br/>I wouldn't make the survival point loss and npc death utterly separated - after all, the survival point loss is tied to a failed risk check, so the fiction should be. Trying to escape from the murderer but fail? He locks you in the room for later or catches the other person with you instead. Fail a protect check? He batters you unconscious and finishes off your neighbour.<br/><br/>Hope that makes sense? It's rarely a 'problem' when playing in a straight slasher movie, but when playing in more esoteric settings or situations, you have to get creative about what exactly survival point loss represents.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
