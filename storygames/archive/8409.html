This is all well and good and tolerant when you're talking about (for instance) "Deep drama isn't a <b>better</b> way of playing than crunchy power-gaming," but there's a dark side to it too.  If you don't say "X is <i>better</i> than Y" than you can't say "X+Y is <i>better</i> than X on its own."  You can't, in short, say "Hey, here's a tool that can help us <i>play better</i>."<br/>\n<br/>\nAt best, you can say stuff like "Well, this tool has helped me and maybe ... blah, blah, blah."  What other recreational activity could possibly flourish under such mealy-mouthed refusal to advocate for techniques?  Are multiple gears something that has helped <i>me</i> with bicycling?  No.  They are a <i>critical tool</i> for all but the wackiest of serious bicyclists, and if I came upon someone trying to cross-country on a one-speed Schwinn I would feel no compunction whatsoever about telling them to get a bike with some gears before they hit the Rocky Mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you guys have any good ways for talking about these things?  Because I get easily stumped.  I can see the problem, but can't see solutions.  I mean, seriously, how do I say to someone "Y'know, you'd be a much better player if you just X" without being an utter twit?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185874/#Comment_185874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T07:14:58+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  7:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things that makes it so difficult is the whole play preference thing.

That would both be nicer and more helpful, I think.  For example, "you'd be able to have more dramatic stories if you let your PC actually care about other characters" or "you'd be able to focus so much more on the cool fighty bits if you skipped over these boring shopping scenes".<br/><br/>In other words, talk about the effect in terms of what kind of playstyle it furthers rather than just saying "better."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185879/#Comment_185879" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T07:44:09+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  7:44AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I get what you're saying:  There are things that only slant a game toward one goal or another, and are therefore quite clearly stylistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think that you're totally wrong that it's hard to imagine something that would really help <i>everyone</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the "basic social things" can be extended quite easily into "advanced social things" and even "post-graduate social things," in a way that's quite powerful in its effect on <b>any</b> type of game.  Indeed, because of the constraints of the RPG format, it is much easier to give social advice within its bounds than it is to give more general purpose "getting along in the world" social advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, all RPGs have a narrative, even if the construction of the narrative is not their <i>point</i>, and there is a broad swath of skills that have to do with understanding the flow and pacing of that narrative (and adjusting your choices to fit) that are useful for anyone playing an RPG, no matter what they're seeking to get out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, there are probably other whole families of skills that I haven't thought of in this "top of the head" survey.  My overall point is that the quite natural tendency to avoid preaching about the skills that are matters of <i>style</i> has stopped people from teaching the skills that are matters of substance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185880/#Comment_185880" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T07:48:54+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  7:48AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I think this particular community is remarkably good at <i>not</i> doing this.

When I was young, my whole group was learning together how to play the game, and we acted like it ... I'd take advice from Tim, and then turn right around and offer him some advice and he'd take it, and we'd try each others ideas not because we'd been <i>ordered</i> to, but because we wanted good ideas to try out.</blockquote>\nThere's a difference being THE authority, and being AN authority.  I've got friends whose advice about health care I will always heed, but I will always ignore everything they say about carpentry, because I believe they know far more than me about the former and know far less than me about the latter.  Likewise, I don't give them advice about health care, but I'll dispense advice freely when the tools come out.<br/><br/>Sounds like Tim and your other friends were authorities in the sense that for certain things, you thought their ideas were likely to be better than yours (or at least no worse than yours, in a group of complete novices); if, on the other hand, you hated everything Tim ever did in a game, you would likely never take gaming advice from him, even if he was ordering you to do it.  Authority in this case has nothing to do with who's in charge, it's all about who you trust and how you trust them.  If  you have reason to trust Tim's advice, you'll take it.  If you have reason to not trust Tim's advice, you won't.<br/><br/>And maybe that's part of the problem of "better" in a creative context:  it's difficult to separate the problem of taste from the rest of it, and so if you don't trust them on matters of taste it becomes much harder to trust them on practical skills.  There's certainly no reason why you couldn't benefit from taking singing lessons from a demonstrably tone-deaf vocal coach...but it's hard to imagine anyone taking that vocal coach's advice or passing it along without layering on a whole bunch of caveats.  ("Yeah, so he can't sing on-key and can't really teach you to sing well, but he CAN teach proper breathing, so as long as that's all you're asking him for, you'll be fine.")  More likely someone who was interested in singing would go to a better authority on the matter, someone they trust more fully, and thereby sidestep the whole mess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185897/#Comment_185897" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T08:58:43+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  8:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Look, this isn't about better or worse, it's about advocating for the kind of play you want<span style="text-decoration: underline;">openly</span>.</blockquote>No, it's about better or worse.

To the first extreme, we can respond that some methods of play seem <i>objectively</i> better: for example, listening, or not hitting other players in the face. To the second, we can respond that many methods of play that are touted as objective are actually subjective: for example, "The players should not read the adventure before playing it" or "You should push each other's boundaries".<br/><br/>We're likely to end up with a postmodern position, where people <i>do</i> argue that "X is a better way to play than Y", and different people argue different ways to play, but we accept that as a good thing. We understand none of the explanations are <i>objectively</i> correct, but we learn something from the variety of different explanations.<br/><br/>Even then, it's not entirely satisfactory. Are any of these explanations <i>actually</i> better? Should we treat them all equally?<br/><br/>(This means I agree with Jonathan, above, and I imagine he'll explain it better than me).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185904/#Comment_185904" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T09:32:45+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  9:32AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my opinion, there isn't "better" or "worse" in gaming, which is why better/worse discussions don't make very good progress. Gaming is about "more fun", "less fun", and "not fun at all." Play advice is, I think, all about better and worse ways to get to the fun.<br/><br/>Talking about <i>fun </i>is harder than talking about <i>better</i>, because when I say "this is better", I've got the power. When someone contradicts me, I can easily challenge them to back up their statement. When I say "this is fun", you've got the power. If you say "I tried that, and it's not fun". I can't baldly contradict you. I have to back up my statement now. That's the core challenge of talking about gaming, at least as I see it.<br/><br/>If we talk about better and worse in gaming, it needs to be in the context of a better/worse way of describing fun; a better/worse way of achieving a certain goal on the way to fun; a better/worse way of getting the fun out of a particular system, theme, game, or situation. And we do need to talk about what's better or worse, we just need to do so carefully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185905/#Comment_185905" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T09:35:25+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  9:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2009 9:35AM by komradebob.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>It's just that you're putting it in the context of being about<i>your</i>interests.</blockquote>Ah ... so you're advocating that context as a helpful social buffer, yes?<br/><br/>I can totally get behind a style that's more like "Oh yeah, I totally prefer biking with gears ...

Briefly, I was sturuck by the fact that JD took stuff from the advice section ( the soft methods) to heart, where I didn't, and from his reports, it made a huge difference.<br/><br/>As for access to that stuff, consider how different a game runs if players have access to the procedures form step one, as opposed to the GM having access because everything is in a single book. Consider the difference when all players have a player book, versus the old boxed set Player book + GM book. Consider the difference between an approach where certain methods of well, whatever, are presented straight off and required in some form, rather than thrown in at the end as advice on being a good player.<br/><br/>All very different and not likely to produce the same results at all.<br/><br/>As for getting it out there and experimentation, well, sadly the truth is that succes breeds success and experimentation and imitation and improvement.*<br/><br/>A game with whatever methods that you think are importnt that becomes widely known and discussed will be built upon. One that never gets picked up almost doesn't matter, and the best you can hope for is independant parallel invention of something similar.<br/><br/>*Edited to Add:<br/>Basically, this is the path of the generation of RPGs as a hobby. D&amp;D advocates and hard-codes a certain style of play that had already existed in some forms, then becomes picked up, imitated and expanded upon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185917/#Comment_185917" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T10:28:13+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 10:28AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can we look to other fields for models?

Matthijs Holter and me have arranged "role-playing salons" for years, and have found such a setting a good venue for lots of discussions that are hasardous (at best) on the net.<br/><br/>So my advice: make yourself a "role-playing salon". That is: gather some people in the know, play some or just talk rpg's. You may have someone preplan a talk onm a topic for each night, or you may state the topic and let the discussion flow. It's very nice, both socially and intellectually.<br/><br/>I get stumped a lot on forums like this by the simple reason that I often say that not all things are equal. The simple fact is that some playmodes and tools of play are far better than others, but the net is a place where such insights collide with the identity of many a browser ... I have done so repeatedly anyway, but lately I have concluded that it is better to keep these insights for venues where they have a greater chance of bearing sweet fruits.<br/><br/>The web is nice, but it is not an all-compassing solution for human communication. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185922/#Comment_185922" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T10:48:58+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 10:48AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this discussion got abstract really fast.  Tony, can you help bring it back to some of these concrete "better" things? Here's my "walking the dog" thoughts: I feel that the key problems with improving player behavior in a significant way are<br/><br/>1. Can the behavior actually be changed without disrupting other behaviors that are important to the play experience? (i.e. how do you change just a small part of the interconnected whole)<br/><br/>2. Context: "Better" how, for whom, and under what conditions? (specific games, play styles, group dynamics, when playing with specific individuals)<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>You could say, "Jonathan, you aren't very good at games in which you have to compete tactically in order for your contributions to be valued by the group or in the fiction. You're always trying to be expressive through the mechanics instead of just playing hard to win."  (This is true.)<br/><br/>Or you could say, "Jonathan, when you GM, sometimes you consistently restate other players' contributions in your own words, stripping some of the spontaneity and energy from play, as well as robbing players of feeling like they are directly participating." (This is something I keep an eye on and like to think I have gotten better at.)<br/><br/>Or you could say, "Jonathan, when you are organizing or GMing a game, sometimes you facilitate a play environment in which players compete to do the 'most awesome' thing instead of following the natural ebb and flow of the fiction, creating an awkward social/narrative dynamic." (Something I try to avoid, but sometimes still happens.)<br/><br/>However, not all of these are universally bad things that should be avoided if my play is to get better.  They're mostly bad in specific circumstances.  Maybe I should just avoid competitive games entirely, if I don't enjoy that kind of play, instead of trying to play them in a way I find unsatisfying.  Honestly, I'm not sure I could change that part of how I approach games without destroying my overall play priorities. Also, sometimes it's important for a GM to restate player contributions to validate them or work them more effectively into the fiction, as long as it's not overused; plus, there are entire styles of play (which we may consider less functional, but some groups seem to love them) that thrive on seeking GM approval and validation.  Finally, there are some games and play styles in which the escalating awesome thing is totally functional and great.<br/><br/>On the theoretical side, aesthetic relativism in art comes from, uh, three main revelations, I think:<br/><br/>1. High and low art were traditionally defined by the idea that some people have good taste in art and some don't.  Good taste was thought to be cultivated through education and regular appreciation of great works, which was, of course, limited to the upper class.  This was later found to be arrogant bullshit.  So I'm personally really wary of assuming that study and personal reflection necessary leads to play that is better or more fun.  Certainly, it's changed the way I play, but it's also made certain kinds of play, which I remember once really enjoying (relatively passive participation in GM-authored adventures), completely unsatisfying.<br/><br/>2. Descarte was really into subjectivity, right?  Nobody can know what goes on in anybody else's head, which makes it really hard to judge other people's aesthetic enjoyment of something and decide whether it's better or worse than their own enjoyment.  All we have is what people say they enjoy, and we pretty much have to take their word for it.  If folks claim to really love play styles that we consider to be based on dysfunctional relationships and full of ridiculous power fantasies, who are we to say that they don't really?  Or would enjoy something else more?  We have no idea.<br/><br/>3. The "institutional theory of art" was really influential, arguing that good art is basically determined by a group of influential people agreeing that something is good, meaning that value and quality are socially determined.  Took us hundreds of years to figure that out, crazily enough.  This holds true in roleplaying, but on a micro level as well.  The only people who can determine the value of a specific play experience is the people at the table, which makes universal declarations of "better" really difficult and contingent on who's sitting across from you.<br/><br/>Hopefully some of that is useful to this discussion.<br/><br/>I also think that there's a tendency towards, uh, harsh universal declarations of good and bad, that comes mostly out of frustration with the social environment of roleplaying.  Remember those movements to have strong criticism of games that were terrible or lacking?  Yeah.  Honestly, your post reminds me of that in some ways.  You're saying that we've constructed a social environment in which it's not okay to say the really harsh things you want to say, about how other people's play (or games) are no good.  Honesty would make everything better.  Would it?  I'm not sure.  I feel like the existing social environment of "play and let play" (or "publish and let publish") does a lot of good.  Is relativism really preventing us from making our own play better and better?  I'm not sure.  Do you really want me to tell you all the things I find annoying / less good about the way you play?  Maybe not.  Would it make playing with each other more enjoyable or just make the social situation between us worse, such that we might never play together again?  Who knows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185926/#Comment_185926" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T11:06:50+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 11:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas:  I have foolishly forgotten to mention the context of my question.

I am quite clear on the subject, so as not to leave any player in the dark about the intention to create compassionate and entertaining play, normally with whatever depth we may plunge into during our interactions. Before play I am <i>positive </i>in my instructions. During play I remind my players of my positive instructions, and at the same time I am <i>short and dismissive</i> towards any disruptive behaviour. Focus on the things you want, and play down the things unwanted.<br/><br/><b>- As an ordinary player</b> I tend to shrink from any responcilbility in this regard, more than is normally expected from me as a player. What I observe of disruptive behavior at the table is not something I tend to comment. I am conscious in praising my GM for any good game-session, or great scene, as I know myself how nice it is to have some thanks for my achievements as a GM.<br/><br/>I should note that my GM'ing is mostly professional, and my playing is mostly with old friends (and they are heavily into old-school playing). So these are highly different venues of play.<br/><br/>I'll offer some thoughts on that:<br/><br/><b>In my profession</b> I have had the privilege to explore lots of different tools for role-playing, and have ever striven to better myself as a GM, and my game-sessions. I have used my professional GM'ing to develop my rpg Fabula too, and have had ample opportunity to observe how some tools work and some don't. I've also observed how all-important a good balance in the method is. In my experience a method full of great tools may create totally crappy play, due to the fact that the balance of it is bad. "Keep it simple, keep the pace" is my first advice to all GM's I lecture on the subject. When I lecture on a principle of <i>simple and straightforward leadership at the table</i> most people tend to warm to my tools and theories of GM'ing.<br/><br/><b>As for my private game group</b> ... I have played with them since the mid-eighties, and our game-play has not developed noticeably during that time. It is a normal group of friends playing rpg, with an good amateur as GM, and there is no discussion of what is "better". We have the usual stories about the times we did something particularly funny, or exciting, or engaging, but we don't "discuss" our game-play as such. I believe this is fairly common in a traditional group, and that it is a stiff frame in which to institute any kind of change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185928/#Comment_185928" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T11:22:00+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 11:22AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathon:  On a practical level, I cannot imagine why I would <i>ever</i> phrase any suggestion in as intensely negative a way as all of your examples.  I'm much more into "Try this <i>as well</i>, it's fun!" than I am into "Thou Shalt Not!"<br/><br/>My suggestions tend more toward things like "Y'know, I like to leave anything I contribute creatively to the game a little unfinished, and then the GM or the other players have a nice little space where they can invent stuff to complete my thought in their own way.  If you haven't tried it you really should.  It's like a magic recipe for fostering creative connection."<br/><br/>Maybe I'm misreading, but this seems very different from the sort of suggestions you put forth as examples.<br/><br/>On your theoretical discussion:  I worry that aesthetic relativism is a compelling red herring in this regard.  The fundamentals are more ... well ... fundamental than the substance or even the goal of our creative expressions.  They're about the <i>how</i> of our gaming, not the <i>what</i>.  Like, if I asked "What are the fundamental skills of juggling?" a person could easily answer "Well, some people view juggling more as performance, and some more as sport, so there's no way to get at any fundamentals."  And they'd be <b>wrong</b>.  Rhythm and relaxation are the fundamentals, and they're not easy, so jugglers talk about them a lot, no matter what end result they're looking to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185929/#Comment_185929" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T11:38:07+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 11:38AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2009 11:38AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>You're saying that we've constructed a social environment in which it's not okay to say the really harsh things you want to say, about how other people's play (or games) are no good.

In other words, I don't care if you're telling the truth if you don't know what you're talking about. So when someone says "Vampire is just a terrible game!" I don't care if it's honest, it's flat wrong in every conceivable way forever.<br/><br/>Now, if you don't think it's wrong, if you do think Vampire is a terrible game, then you and I have a discussion, which leads to discussion forums, which leads to the Internet.  That's what I see the whole benefit of discussion forums as being. Not because I have some driving interest in others opinions. Really I can just make that up in my own head, and I win the arguments every time in there. What I am after when I log in here is why people have those opinions and what experiences led to (and from) those opinions. <br/><br/>So I think honesty is a bit of a red herring here. If Tony is asking for permission to call play shitty, okay, but where does that get us, I say "no, it is not shitty" and he says "yes it is here is why" and we are back to where we were before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185930/#Comment_185930" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T11:42:22+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 11:42AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2009 11:43AM by Brand_Robins.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, <br/><br/>I think part of the problem is lots of us don't actually have the same hobby. We use the same words to describe it, but we may not actually be doing the same thing. <br/><br/>Now, within a group that is doing the same thing (or close to), I think there is good reason to advocate for and share new techniques. The mutual advancement of skill and understanding is a noble goal, and one that can move whole fields forward as well as giving individuals resources to use when they wish to expand. <br/><br/>But, my strong feeling is that before we get to that point we're going to have to get better at actually figuring out which of us are doing what and being honest, with ourselves at least, about it.* <br/><br/>Until then we're, to use yet another analogy, probably like opera singers trying to give breathing advice to punk rockers trying to explain the best kind of amplifier to flamenco dancers trying to explain about the correct heel-step to a swordfighter. <br/><br/>Seriously, on a lot of RPG forums and blogs you'll find craft advice, you'll find shared techniques, you'll find people arguing for the fine refinement thereof. But when those techniques and craft are, for example, really detailed ways to railroad players down a story of the GM's closing without giving them significant thematic choice, the techniques (and some of them are intelligent, good, and advanced) aren't really helpful if the linear GM controlled story is alien and repugnant to you. But most of these places won't have folks advocating for "This is how you play this kind of game for this result" they'll just say "play better." And yes, we do the same here -- if more cautiously and diffidently. <br/><br/>The good thing about many of the other hobbies that we've used in our analogies is that they have many acknowledge subsets of work. Singing is not just singing. Guitar is not just guitar. And while BMX bikers may share techniques and cross-training with guys on the Tour De France, the majority of their technique, focus, and community are different. <br/><br/>So how do you tell someone 'you'd be a much better player if you just did X?" without being a twit? Well, are they playing with you and are the two of you not maximizing your fun? Because if that's the case, there are lots of ways and I'm sure you already do some of them. But if you mean "How do I tell people I don't play with how to play better, by which I mean more a way I would enjoy playing with them if I were to play with them, despite the fact I don't actually know what their locus of enjoyment is like or what the other surrounding circumstances of their hobby, which might not be quite the same as mine, are and I probably won't ever actually play with them without being a twit" well... that shit is different. <br/><br/>Personally I think we need more splintering. Splinter into subgroups you mother fuckers. Sure, keep many places to keep lines of communication and overlap open. Have many people who are dual citizens. But much of the best work that the communities did is when they were small and focused. As they become wider and more general, and as people all start doing different things but speaking about them as though they're the same, the focus to make better play of any particular type gets lost. <br/><br/><br/><br/>*And this includes the fact that we aren't consistency, either within ourselves or as a group. Which is fine, consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds and all. But it is worth remembering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185934/#Comment_185934" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T11:56:53+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 11:56AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony: Well, then, you're talking about something very different from what I thought you were talking about.

"Story Snippets" in the way I run D&amp;D have more in common with cut-scenes in video games used only to provide a bit of context and color to the real focus of the game: overcoming tactical encounters to achieve a goal.  That's very, very different from the "Story Snippets" in a Sorcerer game which are front and center and indeed being crafted in the moment from the play itself where Strategy has more to do with where you place your narrative momentum.<br/><br/>The advice I'd give on how Strategy-Story Snippets interrelate would be very very different for those two games.  I can't tell you how to make better Story/Strategy snippets without you telling me which game you're playing.<br/><br/>The level that you're talking about I believe applies to ALL social activities.  The skills that are shared across those games are shared across baseball, collaborative writing, partying, getting laid.  What you're talking about is how to be better social human being.

In Sorceror, someone tosses out a story element (his sudden betrayal of the party in order to pursue his selfish goal), you catch it (oh wow, this is showing how much his character values this goal) and return it (as victim I'll help him out by making a big emotional deal out of his betrayal, to enhance the cost and therefore the story impact of his choice).  <br/><br/><i>What</i> people are specifically contributing changes from one game to the next, but the skills of how to handle their contributions, how to layer your own meanings onto them, how to return them hard and fast (or soft and easy, or with a spin, depending) ... these skills are constant across RPGs, and are distinctly different from the comparable skills in other fields of collaboration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185943/#Comment_185943" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T13:19:42+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  1:19PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2009 1:20PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I think part of the problem is lots of us don't actually have the same hobby.

Being concrete is helpful as hell.<br/><br/>As an example, Finaira, my lady, likes the occasional hard mechanical challenge - but she likes to face and solve them alone, as a singular actor.  She's a big player of video games like puzzle quest for this reason, as well.  So, if the game we're playing has nicely tactical fights, and her character calls someone out to a duel, I know what she as a player is after - and <i>I know what my role is in getting her that.</i>  She's given the group her "cues".  As a GM, there are things I can do to give her what she wants.  As a player, I can butt out; she'll be quick.<br/><br/>I know this because she told my group this, and we all went "oooooh", having seen her chase it and get it some of the time, miss it some of the time, in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185951/#Comment_185951" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T14:20:37+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  2:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite>What we want from our pretend-play varies, you bet. But the bloodlessness of describing things as "better" or as "getting the group to have a set style" is nothing but an obfuscatory cover slipped over <i>telling people what you want <b>from them</b>.</i></blockquote>But when you know <i>what</i> people want from you there are still skills involved in delivering it, yes?<br/><br/>In concrete examples:  If someone wants to play a dramatic and moving character, and wants me to help them do that, there are skills that I can deploy toward achieving that goal.  If someone wants to show off their skill at gamesmanship, and wants me to help them do that, there are skills I can deploy toward achieving that goal.  I would suggest that, by the nature of the RPG medium, some of these skills are so bone-deep fundamental that they'll apply to both situations (and, indeed, apply to <i>every</i> thing that someone can want me to do for them in an RPG).  I would further suggest that these skills do not magically manifest in a person the first (or thousandth) time they play an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Are you asking for general principles on how to interact effectively with others, in a creative activity?  I could talk about how group songwriting works in my band, but abstracting that to the point where it's applicable to roleplaying would seem to make it so general as to be not very interesting or insightful.  Likewise, abstracting how one roleplaying group makes decisions to the point that it's applicable to other groups leaves you with really vague homilies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_185972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185972/#Comment_185972" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T15:44:16+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  3:44PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>designing and playing really focused, short-form games ...

Social stuff might involve answering: Did someone introduce that because they liked where things were going, or didn't like it? Do they intend it to flow seamlessly or be a shock?

But I'm not sure how far we can usefully take this, as we already have an extensive vocabulary in which to define and discuss these issues, and it has only gotten us this far.<br><br>The social elements you discuss in your playcraft threads are just one part of gameplay however. They can take place in games (or other activities) not specifically designed as RPGs (like Candyland or Talisman), and some RPGs (such as D&amp;D) can even be played without them! Personally though, I want to play an RPG where these elements are tactically significant and the core token of play.<br><br>Good playcraft appears very close to good improv theater, and the best way to get good improv is not just to discuss things, but to also do exercises, such as those that make up various Theater Sports (many of which are performed on 'Who's Line is it Anyway'). Mind you, this theatrical game of catch is not something everyone wants to do, or even <i>can</i>. But lets not go there, as that's probably a little TOO touchy.<br><br>The only other thing that really undermines playcraft are control issues, and there are quite a few gamers who are, lets face it, somewhat control freaky. They enjoy the fact that all the variables are quantified and all the rules known. They take great effort to make sure every detail of their character is defined, and that every action can be executed through a rule. You are not going to get good playcraft from these kinds of players unless they are willing to give up some control. But how much control, and in what sense, is often difficult to pinpoint precisely enough.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br>You mention the idea of "catching" what people give you and "returning" it. That's perhaps true, but it's rather general (is catching-and-returning the same in Sorcerer as in Tunnels and Trolls?) and, even then, I can imagine a Gamist game where it's expected that you violently squash other people's ideas (you're sending a troll at me? Fuck that shit, he's falling in that pit I dug earlier).</br></blockquote>\nBut you just provided an example of where one player 'threw' an idea and another 'caught' it. If the second player had said "No you don't, trolls don't exist", THAT would have been dropping the ball. Instead, they ran with it and took action (even if in the past tense), presenting another set of facts to be responded to.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>In some LARPs, I'm not expected to catch what other people give me and return it: I'm expected to play my character and react naturally.

A similar thing needs to happen here. Catching what other people give you and returning it should feel exactly the same as your character reacting naturally. But much like too many calculations break my sense of immersion, there are likely players who have their sense of immersion broken by consciously analyzing this social back and forth.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187270/#Comment_187270" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T15:12:44+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  3:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm.<br><br/>It seems to me that there is a lot of advice that can be given, with the following points being understood:<br/><br/>1. The advice is carefully stated, in a specific way and in a specified context<br/>2. There MAY be situations where the advice does not help, but those are not common<br/><br/>Some examples from John (jenskot):\n<blockquote><br/>5. Give them moments to reflect and absorb what happened. Show consequences. Sell their actions. Make them feel what they just did was important. Show the impact. <br/>6. Slow down when they can't keep up. Speed up when they are stalling or bored. <br/>7. If someone doesn't have a goal, give them one. If they don't like it, transform it into a new goal. Keep doing it till they care about the goal. <br/>8. If someone has a goal, give them a way to get it. <br/>9. If someone has a goal and a way to get it, put complications in their way that can be resolved quickly so they don't get too frustrated but build tension and anticipation in one day obtaining the goal without just giving it to them. <br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>1. If someone gives you a detailed background, use it! Make NPCs out of the characters they mention. <br/>2. If someone wants to explore the world, let them travel around, ask questions, and reveal the world to them. Go to Google Images and show them what the world looks like. Use props. Let them create maps of the world. Reward curiosity! <br/>3. If someone spends time explaining their characters' motivations, make those motivations important! <br/>[...]<br/>8. If someone likes to really act out their character, give them an opportunity to do it! <br/>[...]<br/>13. If someone doesn't care about the game and just wants to hang out, let them do it. When it is their turn, don't worry about the details. Ask them what they are doing and just make it fit in somehow. Don't try to force them to do more than they are interested in. Have them play an NPC.<br/></blockquote>\nHow does this kind of advice fit into what we're discussing? Is it too general, and dangerous if improperly applied? Or too specific to be useful as general RPG advice?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/howandwhy99" title="howandwhy99"><img alt="howandwhy99" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/howandwhy99">howandwhy99</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187345/#Comment_187345" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T03:24:27+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  3:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Do you guys have any good ways for talking about these things?  Because I get easily stumped.  I can see the problem, but can't see solutions.  I mean, seriously, how do I say to someone "Y'know, you'd be a much better player if you just X" without being an utter twit?</blockquote>Well, "better" really comes out when you reward the role players, doesn't it?  They can check their score and see how they are doing in comparison to everyone else at the table.  I think an inherent one-upsmanship about scoring is probably the reason computer role playing games continually need to raise the top level in their games.  Dungeon and Dragons keeps doing it too, if you notice. In regards on how to tell a player better ways to play their role, that's just simple advice.  But I will say it does tend to go against the practice of role playing.  The whole point is to actually perform the role, not have someone tell you how to do it.  You are learning for yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187360/#Comment_187360" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T08:09:56+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  8:09AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            don't conflate wow with all computer Role Playing Games. <br/><br/>wow boosts the level cap with expansions but their are reams and reams of games and mmo's that don't. <br/><br/>Dnd 4th in a real way simply incorporated their preexisting epic ruleset (and you know gussied it up) in a lot of way's it even institued a low cap , where before epic play began with those 10 levels where you get the pattern down, it now ends there with the whole exit strategy being built into the epic destiny. <br/><br/>And the obvious to change actions on the table, is on a behavioral level. <br/><br/>By offering demonstration, leading threw example, be the change you want to be excetra <br/>By offering reward, incentivising the new actions with reward (if you really want to change someone slip someone a 5$) althought often Xp or Flowers *concieved of a desired scene,s colour or story * is often enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8409/better-how-it-has-hindered-growth" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8409/better-how-it-has-hindered-growth" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8409/better-how-it-has-hindered-growth/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8409%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8409%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
