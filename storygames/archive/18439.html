I am Rak, and this is my first forum post after lurking for quite a while.<br/>I have had an itch to attempt story gaming for over a year, but around my current residence (Athens, Greece), people stare at me as if I am speaking Quenya. Not surprisingly, since only D&amp;D 3.P, 4e, and the occasional oWoD session seem to ever take place. Looking for a group for pbp only got me so far, never reaching beyond the first couple of forum pages. <br/><br/>Thus, I dare to ask of you, story games forumites, whether anyone else lives around this forsaken place or would be willing to game online.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
