Why do we play them?" a lot, and have written some thoughts on the matter. They are partial, concentrating only on rewards and incentives.<br/><br/>A first cut of said thoughts can be found <a href="https://mhuthulan.wordpress.com/2017/06/17/what-happens-in-rpg-sessions-how-the-fuck-do-they-even-work/" rel="nofollow">on my blog</a>.<br/><br/>My thoughts here are not startlingly original. I doubt I'm the first to suggest any of these points, or even to suggest them on Story Games. There is some originality in the selection, though - I'm including some things and excluding others. Even my decision to focus on rewards is a selection.<br/><br/>If some of you would like to go along, have a read, and respond here or on the blog, that would be very useful. I'm afraid its 1300 words.

In my experience the priorities you indicate (with social and experiental rewards being overwhelmingly more important than others) are typical of newbies, casuals and freeform gamers. It is not uncommon for long-term practitioners to take the experiental rewards for granted, ignore (or even despise) the social rewards, and have a passionate relationship with some less obvious, "deeper" rewards available in the activity. This is of course possible psychologically speaking because the experienced and competent player is capable of predicting with confidence that a non-obvious and abstract reward will reliably occur.<br/><br/>For example, in my experience serious wargaming is ruled by the lesser rewards you list. The same goes for serious drama play.<br/><br/>But then again, that's just vapid bickering over presentation. The base observations are solid, I feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464122/#Comment_464122" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-17T11:17:19+00:00" title="June 17, 2017 11:17AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2017 7:58PM by Rob_Alexander.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2097, sorry, yes - I screwed that up.

Like if I say "I go to the kitchen and start the potatoes boiling", if you say "Oh, wow, she implied or presupposed there was a kitchen and even potatoes". If we play chess and I say "Queen to F7", if you say "She is talking as if there's a queen and as if F7 is a location". If we exit a movie theatre and I say "Wow, it was scary when Ursula's pets appeared", if you say "She seems to imply that some sort of pets exist, where in reality only drawn images, each slightly different from the preceding one, have appeared in sequence on our retinas".<br/><br/>Shared Imagined Space is special not just because of the <b>Imagine</b> part but because of the three other parts as well. <b>Space:</b> it's a stage we can explore, affect, change. Imagin<b>ed:</b> we're building on what has gone before, whether prep or in-play platform-building. <b>Shared:</b> it's more than one person's delusion, it's something we agree on together.<br/><br/>I get that this is a slightly uncharitable and very literal-minded reading of your text (length is fine btw). But it's like describing a trip by examining how we talked to each other on the bus there.<br/><br/>I think you have a mighty fine analysis brewing here with great examples. Stacking the tables, flashback to Merlina's youth, the concept of a "stilt-tomb". So cool!<br/><br/>But the way you describe it makes it sound so ephemeral. When I cook, I imagine the recipe combinations, and how the food might taste if I added vinegar. When I play chess, I imagine moving wood pieces on a paper board has consequences. When I watch an animated movie, I imagine the images turning into characters in motion.<br/><br/><br/>And when we go to the dungeon\u2026 we're going all the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464124/#Comment_464124" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-17T12:19:20+00:00" title="June 17, 2017 12:19PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As with Eero, my complaint, though unrelated to his, is arguably also presentation oriented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464125/#Comment_464125" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-17T12:26:52+00:00" title="June 17, 2017 12:26PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2017 12:28PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The description of GMing as fishing for S-rewards on the micro level also feels incomplete to me.

They happen less at your table and at the tables of the people you know, but that isn't as much representative of the majority of tables in the world as you may think. This is something I ended up learning here in SG just recently. And man, I used to think of myself as a somewhat open-minded person, but turns out I'm still far from it. So with all due respect to your experience... you maybe still lacking a bit more of experience than you think. Also, weaker rewards feel weaker to you and people you know, but that's again not the same for everyone.<br/><br/>I've readed around here somewhere about how Learning is a rewarding experience by itself too, one that perhaps deserves it's own mention as a separate item instead of being crammed into two disconnected parts; learning the system (the written and unwritten part) is one of the joys of learning here, the other is learning social and other skills while playing as you mention. The Technical rewards you listed seem to include (but not expand onto) something that I've found it's another important form of reward, related to diving into rulebooks and juggling synergic rules together to find an exploit. And that's without still really getting into munchkinism. And where's the story? I play for the story, for the memories I'll have after the game ends. I don't think I'm totally alone in this, right?<br/><br/>Then there are all the things that are wrong with players -here comes munchkinism-, that make the game borderline unhealthy but still get some form of validation through the game, making socially awkward people feel functional for a moment. A GM's OCD and/or control issues suddenly turns into a valuable asset because of the results the combination achieves on the table. Players who loathe attention find their spot while characterizing strong fictional heroes. Some players may get a cathartic experience through the development of an in-game methapor for something they are going through IRL. Power fantasies are one of the best escapes for people frustrated with their real life.<br/><br/>But basically, it looks like you're right about the whole deal.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464128/#Comment_464128" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-17T21:05:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2017  9:05PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I probably agree with Sandra that, at least for me, trying to break down the experience of playing a roleplaying game into a lot of individually rewarding actions, if not technically incorrect, misses something important. The best example I can think of is setting up a domino show or a Rube Goldberg device. While it is necessary to think about every single interaction that makes up the process, the real reward comes largely (in my experience) from seeing it complete "successfully."<br/><br/>I agree that all of the things you listed are generally going to be present in a successful game session, but I think that there's still something missing from your analysis, even though I'm having a hard time articulating exactly what it is.

If some concept doesn\u2019t fit in my head \u2014 if I can\u2019t make sense of it and relate it to my own experience \u2014 I\u2019m not going to write it down.<br/><br/>(that\u2019s not apparent from my OP and first blog post, because I hadn\u2019t realised it then)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464186/#Comment_464186" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T18:34:28+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  6:34PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" rel="nofollow">Rob_Alexander</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>ash, mingled with resentment</p></div></blockquote>\n\u2665\u2665\u2665<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464187/#Comment_464187" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T18:46:41+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  6:46PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, if Forge stuff is nothing but tears for you, I can try to short-circuit that process, and maybe help you steer clear of situations that made people cry in the Forge years.<br/><br/>Here's what I think is useful to take away from CA:<br/><br/>1. It's actually a super simple concept until you start trying to get into specifics about types of CA. <br/><br/>2. It's really hard to generalize about why people play without talking to all the people. This path of understanding is fraught with "well, <i>I</i> do it this way--doesn't everyone?" folly. If you're just trying to capture what's useful to you, then be careful about stating any of it as a general rule.<br/><br/>("Why do rpgs even work at all? Why do we play them?" is very different from "Why do rpgs even work at all for me? Why do I play them?")<br/><br/>3. It's super hard to look at motives and rewards as a phenomenon in RPGs. There's little data that you can trust.<br/><br/>4. If you're going to try, anyway, realize that looking at techniques and ephemeral "in the moment" stuff rarely captures the whole picture. You need to look at large-scale structures of play: Creative Agenda is a structure that <i>necessarily</i> (not incidentally) penetrates every layer of the Big Model.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464191/#Comment_464191" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T19:03:35+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  7:03PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2017 7:05PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is Creative Agenda, yeah. I didn't want to say anything because, like, what do we care? It's possible to say something new and interesting, and sometimes it's nice to start from scratch and say things in your own way. Just imagine if Rob opened up by lambasting some old essay from Ron and explaining about how "Simulationism" has been misinterpreted, and so on. And then somebody would've come in to complain about the Big Model, instead of letting Rob's points stand on their own.<br/><br/>If we wanted to summarise Rob's article in traditional Forge terminology, here are the basic points as I understood him:<br/><b>*</b> Roleplaying is rewarding as an activity for reasons outside the substance of play itself; we should not forget that in CA analysis, as human psychology mixes up social satisfaction with creative satisfaction easily and naturally. Rob discusses social reasons to play under the rubric of "social rewards" and compares them with creative reward structures.<br/><b>*</b> Simulationism is the dominant creative agenda mode, Rob calls it "game-experiental rewards". It's the creative satisfaction you get out of Exploration in itself. He names three examples of psychological mechanisms that are activated by this creative agenda.<br/><b>*</b> Social rewards and Simulationist agenda can and do clash when the players ignore one for the sake of the other.<br/><b>*</b> Other creative motivations are considered lesser because Rob thinks that they are either more uncommon or weaker psychologically when compared to Simulationist base psychology - they're not as essential as "reasons to play rpgs", generally speaking. He explicitly identifies three psychological reward mechanisms which Forgite theory traditionally considers either social or fundamental to Creative Agenda, universally present in good play. Interestingly he does not directly name any of the unique psychological reward mechanisms involved in Gamism or Narrativism (competitive desires, need for self-expression, etc.).<br/><b>*</b> Psychological mechanisms underlying creative agenda are not simple, because they form complex cycles of enforcement and have mutual dependencies. Ultimately, however, we should be able to pinpoint the psychological root needs that rpg activities serve, and those needs are going to be the same ones that all the other cultural activities tangle on, because that's how humans are.<br/><b>*</b> The reason for why people care about creative agenda is that creative experiences - activating reward cycles - are pleasurable. Over a longer time-frame, the best roleplaying is the kind that gives out the most rewarding experiences. Essentially, if one wanted to interpret Rob as giving game design advice, he's saying that the best game is the one with a powerful, coherent Simulationist agenda, that's easy and fun to play with friends.<br/><br/>I imagine that one might conclude that Rob's talking about something different because he's focusing not on the endlessly popular GNS modal theory, but rather the psychological nuts and bolts: he's asking why people have a creative agenda in the first place. People sometimes think that it's not creative agenda if it's not GNS. It's a good question to ask even in the Forgite theory context, specifically because Ron as the most read Forgite theorist never went into it in any excessive detail (due to his own disinclination towards psychology, I understand).<br/><br/>Now that I went to the effort of translation, I suppose I might as well pinpoint my precise criticism of Rob's essay: as can be seen in my summary, I understand Rob to claim that Game-Experiental Rewards - or Simulationism - are universally the central psychological reward mechanism for roleplaying. I disagree: in my experience it is relatively common for various types of roleplaying that the intense rewards of immersion are largely ignored or taken for granted while the actual focus of play - and the reward psychology - concerns something else entirely. This is, of course, simply the observation that creative agendas that have nothing to do with Simulationism do exist.<br/><br/>I often use the holodeck metaphor to explain this point, here's how it goes in this context: Rob's saying that the reason to love the Star Trek holodeck and want to buy one for your home is that it's such an intense experience, and you can get all sorts of kicks out of various programs as you immerse in the holographic entertainment. I remind him that many of us are certainly excited about the holodeck, but it's not necessarily the visceral excitement of immersing in it that intrigues us: it's also possible to play complex games of strategy and intrigue in it, or express your own artistic sensibilities and philosophy by programming it, or use it as a learning tool, and it's simply not true if you claim that the visceral thrill is always gonna be the main factor in turning on the holodeck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464193/#Comment_464193" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T19:17:02+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  7:17PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>lambasting some old essay from Ron and explaining about how "Simulationism" has been misinterpreted</p></div></blockquote>\n\u2665\u2665\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464196/#Comment_464196" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T20:12:10+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  8:12PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Adam and Eero's points, here - it seems to me that Rob's breakdown is very much compatible with the Big Model (indeed, so much so that I had assumed this was a Forge-graduate writing!).<br/><br/>I'm not sure that Eero's point about Simulationism being the focus of the little essay is as strong as he is making it out to be, however. Even in the Big Model, the Exploration layer (which is basically what Rob is calling GE rewards here, right?) is of high importance, and presumably responsible for much of the joy of playing, so this model could be read as entirely compatible.<br/><br/>The Gamist rewards are there; they are just placed in the "Social rewards" category, which seems to be of prime importance (and, indeed, is listed first). Perhaps, for Rob's gaming experiences, those are just as important? I can't be sure from the text; Eero's reading is valid, but I could see an alternative reading as well, where those rewards come first and supercede the "GE rewards".<br/><br/>It is true that the traditional core of Story Now seems to be downplayed (presumably it would be Meaning rewards, which are listed as "lesser rewards", which are "lesser" because "perhaps they happen less often or tend to be weaker").<br/><br/>Here, it's very likely that a Big Model theorist would say that Rob hasn't experienced much - or isn't terribly interested - in Story Now play. However, the former - the implication that Rob just hasn't seen much functional and powerful Story Now play in his gaming history - is also possible. In that case, it's being omitted because he hasn't observed it a whole lot "in the wild", as opposed to it being relegated to a less important role in principle.<br/><br/>(I'm also not sure that a person not specifically looking for that difference can identify the distinction between "that story and those characters felt very real, and moved me!" and "we addressed Premise at the table". I think a lot of people describing what Ron might consider Story Now play would describe their experiences as "GE rewards" in Rob's schemes.)<br/><br/>But who knows, really!

While the two overlap, and realizing a particular creative agenda is very commonly a type of player motivation, I still think that the two can't be conflated.<br/><br/>Some of the things Rob lists line up fairly well with identified CAs, but others, like social action, meaning rewards, and to some extent status rewards, do not. In the same vein, player motivators can exist across creative agendas, and can even supersede CA in terms of shaping the game and delivering a rewarding experience (see: Technical Agenda). The reasons I show up for game night are not necessarily going to be the compass that governs the material contributions I make to the game, the latter being what I functionally understand the role of a creative agenda to be.<br/><br/>Is it possible to play a game with a coherent creative agenda that you have no personal stake in, and still feel "rewarded" at the end of the game? You may get very few GE rewards, but that doesn't have to preclude having any fun at all. And even though the extent to which you experience other rewards may depend on adopting that creative agenda, the desire to experience them is still not the same thing as the creative agenda itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464205/#Comment_464205" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-20T07:26:34+00:00" title="June 20, 2017  7:26AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me restate my comments on the Big Model more vehemently.

I can't speak for Rob when it comes to that. But we apparently share a frustration with CA specifically. For me, CA is "so close, but yet so far". Compared to something like Robin's Laws Player Types where I can just go "naw, doesn't really make sense with what I'm trying to do", with CA it's a lot more "Uh... so close, but not really right..." that it's probably healthiest for me to just try other avenues to design, my own models that I can grok more thoroughly than CA.)<br/><br/>Edit: let me affirm that I love behaviorism.

I don\u2019t see it as a manifestation of behaviourism (in the sense I understand it \u2014 the Watson, Skinner etc sense). I see it as a commitment to empiricism. At least an informal kind of empiricism \u2014 we\u2019re not systematic about collecting experiences, but we try to work from those experiences rather than from speculation.<br/><br/>(Aside \u2014 I heard that Ron is a behaviourist in that sense. I find that extremely bizarre, although it may explain why his writing often seemed to derail for me.)\n<blockquote>Do you have any sense of how much of that is your own experience (i.e. potentially quite different for others), and how much might be a universal statement about roleplaying?</blockquote>\nOn reflection, I\u2019m not that interested. I\u2019m interested in building a model to support my design, and trying it out against myself and the kind of people who play in my games. The latter are likely to be a quite specific demographic, by age, by nationality, by class.\n<blockquote>Would a group that finds Meaning rewards regularly (and considers them highly motivating) be an outlier or an anomaly? </blockquote>\nIn <a href="https://mhuthulan.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/notes-on-a-game-design-philosophy-player-motivation/" rel="nofollow">my 200 word version</a>, I\u2019ve moved from thinking of meaning as a reward in itself as being a component of other rewards. Rewards can be so because they imply progress towards a larger goal \u2014 that\u2019s what I mean by meaning. But I can adapt your question for that \u2013 \u201cWould a group that strongly values the meaning component of rewards be an outlier or anomaly?\u201d.<br/><br/>And to that I answer \u201cI suspect so. But I also suspect more groups get their best rewards from high-meaning rewards without realising it.\u201c <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
