Those of you that know me know that this is my holy grail of game design. I'm not sure what I'd do if I ever made this game, but I love trying.<br/><br/>So, I came up with a few ideas and saw that it would work well in a Solar System (The Shadow of Yesterday) framework. I've decided that each character will have three of four possible Pools that match up to the four suits in playing cards. Choosing which Pool to leave out will have a lot of nice characterization and customization in my mental picture of what's going on. But, I'm sort of stuck at the beginning.<br/><br/>What four Pools could I create that the absence of one doesn't make a character impotent? I don't want anything like Physical Social Mental Willpower because that lack of color is disturbing to me. Also, what does it really mean if one of those is missing?<br/><br/>I was thinking of something like Shadow for one of the Pools. This would give it a nice concept as being a power source and I could see making some neat Refreshes based on it. But I'm stuck.<br/><br/>I don't want the four elements, but if the four end up mapping in a way that allows an implication of the four elements, that would be great, because then elemental spells could be keyed in on this.<br/><br/>Also, I want the Pool that the player chooses to remove to be a weakness for that character. Not in a tactical sense, but in a dramatic or narrative sense. If I don't have Romance, that should be an indication.<br/><br/>Ideas?

I'm with you. Four Pools:<br/><br/><b>Inhuman:</b> Many Final Fantasy characters are inhuman in some manner, ranging from catgirls to animals or monsters or living slot machines. Useful for having special monster powers and attack modes.<br/><b>Past:</b> Most characters have a deep and convoluted backstory that is drawn in as the story unfolds. Useful for knowing exotic fighting styles and possessing special weapons.<br/><b>Passion:</b> Often Final Fantasy characters are driven not by reason, but by simple dreams or passions taken to extremes. Useful for going gonzo on your enemies, limit breaking all over the place.<br/><b>Bishi/Moe:</b> Some FF characters seem to mostly get by on looks and panache, never mussing their hairstyle. Useful for never making a fool of yourself and not being the butt of stupid jokes, and in general being like a protagonist. And of course, the scripted battles will all be won because you light up and your innocent magibabble chosen one powerz save the day.<br/><br/>I'd make it so a character might lack more than one of these, though. Perhaps make some more and let the player pick 1-3 for his character, or something like that.<br/><br/>Alternatively:<br/><br/><b>Shadow</b><br/><b>Holy</b><br/><b>Martial</b><br/><b>Sorcery</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175293/#Comment_175293" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T09:22:22+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  9:22AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>tarot suits.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175308/#Comment_175308" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T10:25:24+00:00" title="October 17, 2008 10:25AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe what I'll do is have them pick from the list the Pools they want and have them choose an <i>element</i> that it ties to.<br/><br/>One of the things, though, that I wanted to have happen, was something like this:<br/><br/>Imagine you getting 3 cards at the beginning of the scene.

(Well, okay, the name is a joke.) It's a fantasy cliche in both Japan and west to have a young, pretty protagonist who just happens to be The One. In Final Fantasy that basicly means that the character gets to explode in a flash of light when the time is right and the prophecy needs to be fulfilled. The fact that this is idiotic is just something we'll have to live with if we want to make that sort of stories. Perhaps the pool should be called Fate or Grace? Grace is pretty good, as in "grace of the gods"...<br/><br/>Inhuman could be called... "Special"? I kinda like the edge to it as is, though. Like the Lee/Kirby Inhumans, it doesn't have to be a negative descriptor. I was first going to call it "Monster" pool, which captures the CRPG mode even better.<br/><br/>I like the idea of the characters having both Pools and elements that modify them. Perhaps you could make some sort of mechanics out of how the Pools shift from element to element when the conditions and the feelings of the character change. Like, a character's Passion pool could be dedicated to Fire &amp; Holy at one point when he's both in love and seeking revenge, then Holy turns to Shadow when he loses his love. Or something like that. I don't know, that's probably outside the FF paradigm, in which characters don't change very much. (My secret: I absolutely loathe the FF narrative paradigm personally, probably because the games themselves are so frustrating and I find anybody who immerses in the badly-written stories an idiot. Your guess is as good as any for why I'm participating in the thread.)<br/><br/>A logical turn, depending on how close you're going to cleave to FF, would be to make the elements some sort of xp modifiers - perhaps a character gains elemental points for doing different things, and these are the xp of the system. Color-coded experience points are something I've wanted to try for some time. Perhaps skills (or whatever TSoY Ability equivalents you're thinking of using) could be both elemental and pool specific... lots of possibilities with this symbology to go to different directions. Be careful, or I might make a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26866.0" rel="nofollow">Solar World</a> out of this...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175330/#Comment_175330" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T13:01:18+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  1:01PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crap, I lost my post.<br/><br/>Eero: You're making my heart break. I do appreciate your help, but I feel bad that you're working on something you loathe. I love FF as a form of nostalgia. My previous TSOY game, Side Quests, did let me know that I can have the world and set pieces as I want it and have a fun game. This is just more tweaking to really get that sheen.<br/><br/>I like Monster, I do. If the game focuses in any way that those that are different are subhuman, it'll be the name. Otherwise, I might just use Special or Race as the name of the Pool. I'm still thinking about it.<br/><br/>I had planned on having the elements shift, once I figured out the assignment of them. I think that if you're going to go from Comrade at Arms to Betrayer Most Foul, then these elements are the way to go. I'm not sure if I should make them prerequisites (Key of the Betrayer: Must have a Shadow trait) or a consequence (Key of the Comrade Buy Off: Choose a trait and shift it to Shadow).<br/><br/>Also, I was thinking of making traits important with Abilities as such: "Spears: Use a spear to kill, impress, or focus your magic. Special: Those who have a Holy trait may make a Spear check to heal a point of Harm at Level 1 on themselves or others."<br/><br/>Finally (elements-wise), since there is this variability with the Pools, I was planning on having the subelement be the type of Harm dished out.<br/><br/>Anyway, the point I'm trying to get to is a core set of Pools (and now Traits, or Pool Foci) from which everything builds. Past and Passion are definitely in there. Bishi/moe could be Presence, as it fulfills an alliterative need in me. If Monster/Special/Inhuman stays as a character creation choice (like it is now in TSOY), then I'd need a fourth Pool - maybe Pain? Otherwise, I'd need to make a decision on Monster.<br/><br/>Finally, since I'm not necessarily limiting this to four Pools, I'm wondering if I might go all out and make the Pools player chosen descriptors. Still working this all out I guess.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone for your help so far!

I genuinely do get doubts about a given person's tastes and sensibilities when they declare that something like, say, FF VII with its asinine plotting, cliched characters and argh, so dull and meandering dialogue touched them deeply and taught them important life lessons.

This really is a topic I've discussed at length with many people, I've played something like 150 hours of FF games in my time and it's not even the topic of the thread. I do enjoy bashing these games and this whole corroded model of game design, but it's just going to make people angry if we start going at it here - start a new thread about it, and we can discuss the good and bad and the ugly facets all you want.)<br/><br/>In truth, though, my point was just to note that while I do know these games and enjoy many of the setting elements, creating a roleplaying game that intentionally duplicates the genuine thematics and narrative stylings of FF games is something that to me seems like a ironic statement. It's like somebody decided to make a roleplaying game about Chick Tracts. So I just thought to mention that even if I insist that something is a key property of the genre, it just <i>might</i> be that I'm approaching the topic from a different perspective than you do. In practice I've noticed that usually people who want to make Final Fantasy rpgs (surprising in a way how common it is) don't actually want to replicate the things I hate about them; so for all practical purposes such a game might even be pretty good and not suffer at all from the things that make FF CRPGs so annoying.<br/><br/>But that's that. Good to see that you're getting your act together, Mark - the game seems interesting, and really and truly does not trigger any insane rages in me like seeing the party menu from a FF CRPG does <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Perhaps it's the fact that you're not <i>actually</i> making a Final Fantasy game that forces me to sit through yet another quarter hour of pressing the x button doing nothing. The silly and over-the-top fantasy worlds of FF are quite playable when you take them away from the console games, I imagine.<br/><br/>As for elemental XP, I think you could easily enough have different crunch require different sorts of xp. Perhaps have some basic stuff that can be obtained with "colorless" (any color) xp, but any of the cool stuff would then require particular colors. Lots of interesting mechanical opportunities there. Or you could shift the boundaries between xp and dice pools and allow spending the elemental xp for all sorts of effects that have nothing to do with improving your character. Heck, something like this would be interesting in normal Solar System, too:<br/><br/><b>Secret of Fira</b><br/>Summon lots of fire magic to burn everybody at once, using the <i>Black Magic</i> Ability. The enemies can resist with their <i>Magic Resistance</i>. <b>Cost:</b> 1 Fire and 3 Passion<br/><br/>At least having to spend xp to cast it would make using large magics pretty rare, I imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175380/#Comment_175380" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-18T03:40:10+00:00" title="October 18, 2008  3:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So long as the Fire XP required something involving a scene with another PC/NPC, I'm in.

Given that, I think I've determined the Pools I'm going to use (for now, at least - best to get a set and try them out than to worry over it for too long).<br/><br/>So, given that, the kinds of scenes (or example scenes) I want to see occur in a FF style story game are:\n<ul>\n<li>Questioning your loyalty to a leader gone mad with power with your compatriots<br/></li><li>Romancing your love, or bemoaning your separation from you love<br/></li><li>Visiting a town from your past and renewing friendships or dealing with rivals<br/></li><li>Participating in festivals, contests, gladiator arenas, or gambling halls<br/></li><li>Explaining to someone about your history or revealing a secret about yourself<br/></li><li>Completing side quests for people, so long as they involve interaction<br/></li></ul>\nI wanted to include "Montage scenes" - (preparing for battle, repairing a vessel, researching vital information, "level" building), but, since that doesn't involve any interaction with PCs or NPCs and is kind of hand-wavey, I'm leaving it out.<br/><br/>These are what I can think of right now. Based on that, the Pools should Refresh on those actions and should indicate that the Abilities come from this source. So:\n<ul>\n<li>Past - Visit someone or someplace from your past. Reveal a secret about yourself. Tell your story to someone.<br/></li><li>Punk - Question the government or its leaders. Defy an authority figure in most any situation.<br/></li><li>Passion - Find a new love, or continue to woo one. Commiserate with your friends over lost or unavailable love.<br/></li><li>Pursuit - Take on a job for someone for the heck of it. Enter a contest that you aren't already trying to win. Challenge someone to a friendly game.<br/></li></ul>\nThoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175571/#Comment_175571" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T11:30:20+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 11:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting; I like your reasoning, even if I only recognize your interpretation of FF tangentially.

These will map directly to three out of four suits (and are the same mapping for everyone). There may be other Pools, like a Job Pool that affect other actions. Combat may end up being a subset of normal resolution.<br/><br/>When you start a scene, you're dealt three cards. Based on those cards, you'll know that you have a strong hand or a weak hand towards certain actions. Based on what you want to do in the scene, but before you use the cards for any sort of resolution, you can describe your actions (I stumble towards you, with murder on my mind, weak from a night's deliberation; I counter your every argument, my words fueled with malice and forethought) to accentuate the pull you made. As players get used to this, things that might have called for rolls in the past are ignored and you move towards drawing cards only when you say, "Oh, no, you don't!"<br/><br/>The cards to which you have no main Pool for can act as helper cards but can't be the lead card. I still think you can have Abilities based on non-Pools - you just won't be able to augment them with Pool points.<br/><br/>Damage in Bringing Down the Pain will actually come from an elemental label attached to your Abilities or your Pools, I'm not sure. Shadow, Holy, Fire, Earth, Water, Air, etc. These elements will have conditions that need to be met to recover from the wounds.<br/><br/>When you play a card, your Ability modifier will allow you to add more cards of the same suit (or half the value of a helper suit). So, an Ability at Grand Master would allow you to add in four more cards to come to your total value. The math will have to be worked on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175584/#Comment_175584" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T12:35:31+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 12:35PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite><br/>Also, I want the Pool that the player chooses to remove to be a weakness for that character.

Based on those cards, you'll know that you have a strong hand or a weak hand towards certain actions. </blockquote>\nI'm not sure how your four Pools are tying into this bit. How do Pools like Past and Principles (which I like) give you this sort of thing? It sounds like you want some flavour to tie into combat, as well as supporting different motivations or avenues for characters.<br/><br/>I would suggest making the "Past" definitely dark and creepy in some way, like "Dark Past". It would be related to underhanded, treacherous behaviour, skills and abilities you can only gain "on the wrong side of the tracks", etc.<br/><br/>Finally, looking over your list of the kinds of scenes you want to see, it sounds like you'd benefit from having a strong drive for characters to "prove themselves" in a competitive sense. This seems to work well (based on my little knowledge) in a FF-type setting/game. I would recommend to rename your "Pursuit" Pool to reflect this kind of drive. It's the ambition of youth to tackle the world head-on.<br/><br/>Finally,  a good name that comes to mind for the "principles" category is "Valor".<br/><br/>I don't know if that helps!<br/><br/>Heck, maybe I'm just trying to shoehorn your four new Pools into the four I'd suggested earlier, without realizing it:<br/><br/>Shadow -&gt; Past or Dark Past<br/>Holy -&gt; Principles or Valor<br/>Love -&gt; Passion<br/>Daring -&gt; Pursuit, Drive, etc.<br/><br/>If that's the case, sorry about that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175586/#Comment_175586" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T12:50:03+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 12:50PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, as for the cards tell you what to do thing (which I'm trying to steal from Best Friends, if that helps), I was trying to make it be something like this:<br/><br/>Card draw: 10 Hearts, 2 Clubs, 5 Diamonds<br/><br/>So, you'd know immediately that some Ability based on Hearts (ex. Seduction) would be likely to win without Bringing Down the Pain, and an Ability based on Clubs (ex. Spear-fighting) would get trashed. An Ability based on Diamonds (ex. Bribery) would have an even chance. These aren't absolutes, but high likelihoods.<br/><br/>Given that, you could start describing strongly with Seduction or weakly with spear fighting or even-keel with bribery. Or ignore them and go with your own thoughts and see how the cards back you up in the end.<br/><br/>So, back to the Pools. I did think hard about Dark Past. And I may go back to it soon. I didn't want to make 3/4 of all the characters have a "Dark Past" when they could have just a Convoluted Past or an Innocent Past or something like that.

We'll see if this works.<br/><br/>There are three main Pools that everyone has. There is a slot open for a fourth Pool, which can be filled by any of the Elements or Jobs available in the campaign. However, this Pool is fueled only by Keys.<br/><br/>Main Pools:<br/>Passion<br/>Cunning<br/>Resolve<br/><br/>Sub Pool examples:<br/>Shadow<br/>Dragoon<br/><br/>So, you'd use and Refresh your main Pools as per the rules. The sub Pool would only be available to you for augmenting your draw or roll by spending accumulated XP acquired by fulfilling the Key or Keys associated with the sub Pool or for activating Secrets (which might be based either on current Pool size or by spending XP again). The sub Pools might grow in power based on total XP acquired for that Pool regardless of whether the XP has been used yet or not.<br/><br/>You can have many sub Pools but can only have one active in a given scene, barring a Secret that allows otherwise.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
