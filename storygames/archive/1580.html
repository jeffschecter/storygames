<i>The Invisibles</i> is a cool comic by Grant Morrison about occult conspiracies, time-travel, rebellion, the nature of reality, alien intrusion and pretty much everything else running through Morrison's remarkably fertile mind when it was being written. It is loaded with wonderful and crazy ideas ripe for stealing for gaming - super assassins and astral time travel, a homeless wizard, a transvestite shaman, a voodoo rapper and a hoodoo scatman, occult cops, alien mind control, language as a weapon, clashing realities, etc. However, <i>The Invisibles</i> is more than just good source material for roleplaying games; in many ways, it is actually <i>about</i> roleplaying games.<br/><br/><i>The Invisibles</i> plays constant games with the nature of reality, and it attacks the idea from many, many angles, using elements like capital-C Conspiracy, Gnosticism, shamanic initiation, the nature of perception, spy-thriller ideas of cover identities and agents assuming aliases and personas, agents rotating their roles (and changing their personalities) within a cell etc. Several characters cross the boundaries between fiction and reality, both fictions within the comic and the fiction of the comic itself: There's a character who's written a story called <i>The Invisibles</i> and finds herself living through it; King Mob, the supercool superassassin main character, is very consciously modeled after Grant Morrison himself - and Grant Morrison has tried to model himself on the character in some ways; Mob is also a writer (he uses his fiction as false memory to escape interrogation), and we are aware that he's constantly inventing himself as a character. Another idea is that  reality (or the story of the comic) can be explained as a simulation game being experienced by players projecting themselves into it from outside. These might be higher-dimensional beings, transmigrating souls or just future gamers with good VR.<br/><br/>I don't think you can get deep into the Invisibles without noticing that what Morrison is talking about is roleplaying; One of the concepts he tosses around is the idea of "fiction suits", by analogy to diving suits or space suits, they are the apparatus that enables us to enter a work of fiction, perhaps one we are creating, and experience it, interact with it, from the inside. In the fiction, of course, a fiction suit is a character; but from the outside of the fiction, we know s/he is special, because s/he is a <b>player character</b>. The idea of a fiction suit is useful when you're trying to reconcile authoring narrative with immersing yourself in a character and a world. Think of yourself as a fiction suit and apply to game.<br/><br/>I also find that there are strong similarities between what Morrison experienced writing this ongoing comic (as described in interviews) and what we experience running and playing an ongoing campaign, for example, the feeling that the world is reflecting game reality (and the awareness of how we use game reality to examine events in the real world, and to explore or avoid issues in our personal life.<br/><br/>Anyone else read <i>The Invisibles</i> and has any thoughts on this?                </div>

                            Actually, I found that a lot of the <i>Invisibles</i> involved Morrison indulging in blatant Mary Sue-ism and empty pseudo-postmodern trickery.<br/><br/>The first volume is pure gold. The second volume was OK. The third and final volume was rushed horribly, and looks it too.                        </div>

                            I'm a huge fan of The Invisibles, and whilst I've never personally made a direct connection to RPGs and the series, what you're saying does make sense.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games as such are never referenced in the series that I recall, but as you point out so much of the series is about story, fiction/reality and playing roles that its clearly going to have relevance to RPGs / storygames.  There are strong themes about the power of fiction and narrative to actually shape the world, and also where the line between the two actually resides.  <br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't read it: do.  Its awesome.                        </div>

                            You know, I'm totally up for discussing <i>The Invisibles</i> completely aside from gaming, because it's a fairly rich work, even if it isn't always consistent.  And actually that inconsistency is another, perhaps unintended, parallel with gaming, particularly when doing a long campaign: there are going to be ideas you bring out in the beginning of the work, that kind of go nowhere, and when you rope 'em back into the story years later there's often a bunch of ret-conning.<br/>
<br/>
Another gaming parallel: the shadow-theater at the start of the "Arcadia" arc in Volume I, where the protagonists and their adversaries are ultimately working to the same purpose.  Much as the player-characters and their enemies are opposed on one layer of reality, but on another layer are manifestations of a single process on the players-around-the-table layer of truth.<br/>
<br/>
There are also some role-playing references in "Apocalipstick"--death as just a game, and some of Fanny's dialogue when encountering the assassin in the men's room.<br/>
<br/>
I seem to recall there was a lot of Joseph Campbell stuff in there too, but that might be ranging a bit further afield.                        </div>

<p>Sure, it may have been Mary Sue-ism, but on the other hand, you don't see too many Mary Sue players or writers who <em>suffer</em> with their words as Morrison did. I mean, the guy got a collapsed lung and multiple weird infections along with his alter-ego. So credit for that.</p>
<p>By curious (ha!) coincidence, I happen to have been re-reading the series over the last couple of days. My main gaming insight is that it would work pretty nicely with Heroquest--there are multiple heroquests done within the story by almost every character (Boy seems to be the only exception). The threefold interaction of Lord Fanny's (one of the sexiest comic book characters ever) initiation as a youth, bargain with the death god to save the team, and payment in pain and danger when captured by the enemy really cries out for some tidy mechanic that could do that and have it make sense. I guess it could be a relatively simple resource mechanic, like so: 1) Fanny gets into debt invoking the death god to defeat Orlando; 2) Fanny gets captured, partly but not completely repaying the debt; 3) Fanny's player does a flashback to the initiation to gamble in order to get fully right with her supernatural creditors.</p>
<p>Useful stuff, IMO, but I do regretfully agree that when publishers let Grant have his head, he just goes totally nuts, sometimes in ways that just aren't very helpful to his artistic aims. Say what you will though, his magic seems to work--how many comics authors get such a rock 'n' roll lifestyle?</p>

                            Sometimes I suspect that Morrison's lifestyle is a product of Morrison's marketing department, but hey.  The one fault I find with the series, and with some of Morrison's work in general, is that the pacing/exposition goes completely ker-flooey in the final act.  Whether that's because he keeps trying to create a "runaway train" effect and botches it, or because editors chop out important scenes, I can't tell.<br/>
<br/>
There's a pretty cool moment in <i>The Invisible Kingdom</i> where Mr. Six reaches thorugh the comic book page and merges with the reader, prompting you to comment, "My God, the whole thing is alive and self-aware."  Whether this is effective or not as a literary trick, who knows, but maybe it's a good example of Immersionism?<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>
Speaking of games: what if there were a game of Sorcerer, where the character's demon was its player?  The demon's Need would be things that the player definitely wants to see in the game world, and the desire is the player's preferred outcome?  It would be cool to make the rituals have specific player-level effects . . .                        </div>

                            I played in a D&amp;D game where your character could make a pact with Hell and learn the secrets of the D&amp;D mechanics. If you sold your soul, the devil would help you min-max.  The demons did this because teaching humans to treat each other as collections of statistics encouraged them to dehumanize one another. This was an effective set-piece because it both legitimized and subverted the role of minmaxing in D&amp;D.                        </div>

                            OK, I have to concede that <i>The Invisibles</i> is a flawed work, and that the last volume with it's artists changing every couple of pages is pretty chaotic mess. But even there you find veins of pure gold. I'd recommend <i>The Filth</i> as a work that is just as innovative (and insane) as the Invisibles but that maintains a much more consistent level of quality. And yeah, James' point about how a long campaign can be just as inconsistent is right on the mark: the feel that Morrison's comic was spiraling out of control and buffeted by circumstance and misfortune mirrors the highs and lows of a long game.<br><br>Damn, that idea for Sorcerer is neat; so's the D&amp;D one.<br><br>The similarity of the Invisibles to Heroquest isn't accidental: Heroquesting is all about initiation into the mysteries of your cult(ure), and The Invisibles uses the mystical initiation - of Dane and Fanny, but also of Mob and Six and Robin and Sir Miles and everyone else, including Morrison, the reader and the whole human race - as its central theme and main narrative element. The view of time as a cross-section of something unfolding in a higher dimension also serendipitously matches Heroquest's god-time (but I think both Stafford and Morrison were drawing on the Australian Dreamtime here).<br><br>A friend of mine once played in a one-on-one game where his character slowly discovered that he was a character in a roleplaying game. It ended on a pretty sad note with the character pleading with the player to keep playing and not abandon him to the limbo of non-existence. Which I think left him with this spooky image in his head of his character sitting in a blank room somewhere, waiting. Some day, he'll get his revenge...<br>... the same guy also ended a long running Vampire LARP he was GMing by letting the PCs gang up on the main villain, who was the GM. All this meta nonsense was immediately retconned away by the guy who took over as GM, much to the players' relief. <br>All this he did before I turned him onto Invisibles (in my mind, at least, I was using it as source material for our common campaign).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            There's a good Invisibles concordance called <i>Anarchy For The Masses</i> which is a great tool for unraveling the storyline of the sadly, sadly rushed third volume (and the latter parts of volume 2, which have the same problem from the same sources in my view). It's also a fun read with lots of interviews and such. Published by Disinformation if I remember correctly.<br><br>One of the most interesting and under-explored aspects of the "fiction suit" concept is as a way of approaching time travel in fiction: making it not about going and finding all these different stories from history, but as a way of looping back and becoming a multitude of characters in the story you were in already. That might be fruitful for game design, or it might turn into the final sequences of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. "A trash can... remember a trash can."<br><br/>That could be fun too, actually.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            dotan: Agreed, I enjoyed <i>The Filth</i> much more than <i>The Invisibles</i> simply because it's more compressed: it doesn't have time to outstay its welcome, and everything is happening at once.<br><br>Call Me Curly: I'm mildly distrustful of any model of gaming which posits that some games are for kids and some are for grown-ups. I think as gamers get older they tend to get a better idea of what they actually enjoy in gaming, I don't think their preferred play style necessarily changes. (Which isn't to say they'll always play the same games in the same way - if all you've got to hand is <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> you're going to have trouble finding something to do that isn't dungeon crawling. But it does mean that they can more competantly seek out the particular type of fun they are after.)<br/><br/>Tangent: As far as I'm concerned, the most mature (as in grown up, not "look at how nasty I can be!") writer in comics these days is Warren Ellis. <i>Transmetropolitan</i> is a classic.                        </br></br></div>
