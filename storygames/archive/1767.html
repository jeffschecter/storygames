                    OK it had to happen... the grand-pappy of all D&amp;D settings... I love some elements of it and hate others with a passion. The Suel Imperium and the Scarlet Brotherhood are great - Melnibonean inspired wizard empire and their racialist martial arts assassin descendants. The Slavers and the Earth Dragon also rock. <br/>
<br/>
Suckitude - nearly all the names for countries and cities are awful, the presence of all of Gygax's characters and those of his buddies looming large over the whole setting - especially the dire Zagyg. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?                </div>

But seriously... I'd either pare down the list of gods, or get rid of the cleric class altogether and limit deific interference, so the gods are more abstract. How many gods of the sun, or the sea are there in this one region anyway?                        </div>

                            I sort of LIKE the laundry list of obscure deities. It's more like real-world ancient religions. I like it better than "There are exactly twenty gods, and their spheres of influence are neatly divided up."<br/>
<br/>
The thing that is difficult here is that Greyhawk is comprised of layer upon layer of fantasy pastiche, with not a great deal of unique ideas going on. You could essentially say, "Make an awesome generic fantasy setting," and come out with the same end-product.<br/>
<br/>
The white supremacist monks do kick ass as far as villains go, though.<br/>
<br/>
How 'bout... Vecna won?<br/>
<br/>
My own take on a couple of Greyhawk things:<br/>
a) If the gods (or their avatars) attempt to personally intervene in worldly events, they are susceptible to bodily destruction from rival gods. Hence, they have to lay low and dole out the magic powers via clerics.<br/>
b) Perhaps once there was a god of pacifism... but he's conspicuously absent. Clerics are expected to get out there and promote the faith by force if necessary, and not sit around in the cloister. Faiths which don't do this are obliterated.                        </div>

                            How about this: Put your favorite fantasy setting on an asteroid. Drop that asteroid into the middle of Greyhawk. Splatter your favorite fantasy setting all over Greyhawk in tidal waves of molten magic. Let the inhabitants sort it out.                        </div>

                            Since the most significant feature of Greyhawk is that it's a plain (oh, so plain!) vanilla fantasy setting, I'd pull out one level: The players take the roles of Gygax's real-world friends, vying to make the largest imprint on the fantasy world. Each session is a fantasy-world one-shot where the characters (Gygax's friends) play sub-characters (in the fantasy world), at varying levels of zoom. One might be a dungeon crawl, another a kingdom-level diplomacy game, another a gods vs. gods conflict, and so on. Probably, there are new sub-characters for each one-shot. Each session allows one (or more) of the (Gygax's friend) characters to make some permanent mark on the fantasy world, generally by re-naming something (a region, religion, magic spell, or what-have-you).                        </div>

                            There were some things about Greyhawk that I dimly remember thinking could be awesome, way back in the days when I still played anything related to the setting. <br/><br/>Unfortunatly its been at least 15 years and I don't have any of the books anymore, so I can't easily access the stuff I thought had potential. But I'll dig about in the sub-brain and see what comes out, even if it's inacurate. <br/><br/>There was a group of monks, evil monks (Scarlet Brotherhood?), who were into eugenics programs to try to get the "pure blood of the race" back because they felt it would give them power. In the adventure book that switched Greyhawk from 1st to 2nd edition there was an adventure that included these guys that talked about how they would host the northerm barbarians (another branch of the same ancient race) and be really, really nice to them in order to get their genetic material. This now seems to me like an opportunity for some really hard core nasty villains. Seduction and assasinaiton ninja-girls who milk men with the correct blood for their seed, probe teams that give the term a really ugly meaning, sorcerous vat collonies of genetically modified flesh gollums, missionaries who go to other bastions of the race to indoctrinate them in their own superiority, spells that have saftey triggers keyed to blood types, and so on. You can totally turn these guys into sexual deviant ninja-nazi sorcerers and then go off on them Exalted style. Or you could run it Sorcerer style, with the Blood being the demons. <br/><br/>I also loved the way that the setting seemed to have an evil demi-god burried under every other rock. So many immortal evils had risen and fallen in the setting (Iuz? Venca? I don't remember them all, but do remember that there were a lot) and had only been taken out by being imprisoned in magical bubbles beneath the ground or cut into pieces and scattered to the winds that it seemed like the average farmer must stumble over the left nut of Venca every other week. This now makes me want to run a procedural game where the PCs are a group of Paladins whose job is to travel the world in response to the prophecies of an oracle, putting down the inevitable rise of the DARK LORD that happens, you know, every single week. Something like Ghostbusters, but with TOTAL COSMIC EVIL instead of slime being what is at risk. I like to envision it with the PCs eventually getting that jaundice that the marines from Aliens had, and as they're going in to face the rise of yet another dark lord saying things like "Great, another evil eyeball taking over the villagers" and "I love the smell of holy water in the morning...."                        </div>

"Left nut of Vecna" is a classic. On reading that, I very nearly burned out my sinuses with orange juice, but it's all good.<br/>
<br/>
So the idea would be run it tongue-in-cheek, but kinda serious, right? If you were going for straight up farce, I'd do something like Elfs instead.                        </div>

                            There's a lot of under-the-surface stuff in both the Greyhawk stuff and the AD&amp;D1 books (especially the Dungeon Master's Guide) that, to me, have Gamma World written all over it.  You've got the Rain of Colorless Fire and the other big disaster (what was it called?) that destroyed perhaps several worlds, you've got a long "dark age," you've got monsters in the wilderness that need to be cleaned out in order to make the world civilized, powerful artifacts hidden in ruins.                        </div>

                            The other of the Twin Cataclysms was the Invoked Devastation upon Baklunish. It was so bad, it gets an ambiguous name like "Invoked Devastation."<br/>

                            Wow. I know that Greyhawk probably has the longest way to go of any big published D&amp;D setting to make it Awesome, but is is really so hopeless that people can't even try to awesemofie it? It has to devolve into parody?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that the parodies aren't funny, but...c'mon. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. And doesn't make Greyhawk very Awesome, it seems to me.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the "Grand-daddy" of D&amp;D settings might be considered to be Tekumel - the system it was published with as Empire of the Petal Throne was so similar to D&amp;D as to be absurd not to call it D&amp;D. But it was definitely the first setting published for RPGs. And it still stands up pretty darn well.<br/>
<br/>
But back to Greyhawk. By way of my standard response to the awsemoification threads, I'll merely point to the thread where we discussed and created some keywords for Greyhawk using Hero Quest: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19402.msg204330" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19402.msg204330</a><br/>

                            I think one of the problems with trying to "awesomeify" Greyhawk is that it lacks the conceptual binding glue that settings like Planescape, Dark Sun, and Spelljammer have. You can really summarize each of those in a few words, and while you're losing nuance, you're still transmitting the core idea. Greyhawk's core idea, on the other hand, is "the standard D&amp;D campaign setting," and from what I can tell Ptolus would be the awesomification of that - everything that is D&amp;D, crammed into a single city.<br/><br/>I suspect this is why Kingdoms of Kalamar and the Scarred Lands eventually died as well - they were both great, but lacked that easily transmissible core idea.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with Greyhawk, here are some references:<br/>Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhawk" rel="nofollow">Greyhawk</a> entry.<br/>The current <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=lg/welcome" rel="nofollow">Living Greyhawk</a> page.                        </div>

<p>You know how, months ago, we talked about core story?</p>
<p>What if Greyhawk is the world that automatically emerges around that core story; it's the country where <em>your characters</em> are on a travelogue-quest to change or save the world.</p>
<p>That doesn't actually give you the various bits of setting crap that settings are usualy built out of, but it gives a guiding, character-centric principle; for every character there is a homeland and a place where he is out-of-place; for every desire there is opposition and danger...</p>

I"m interested, do you have more thoughts on these two things?!<br/><br/>Not a huge amount at the moment. It's just that early D&amp;D was often an uncomfortable marriage of Tolkien (wise elves, stout footed hobbits, idilic rural fantasy) and Howard (savage combat, barbarian warriors superior to the civilization they sometimes protect and sometimes despise, lost and evil ancient magics). In Greyhawk it comes out more clearly than normal, is all, a setting in which you get very Tolkenesque all holy elves mixing with humans who are having race wars over getting pure breeding stock because they need to reclaim the lost glory of their devolved line (Atlantis - monkey - Cimmerian) all in one setting. <br/><br/>Which is why folks like Iuz and Vecna could be so hit or miss: they were the inheritors of two different strains of villains, the evil sorcerers of Howard and the immortal broken demiurges of Tolkien. <br/><br/>Of course, the magic was all out of Vance and so you've got a bit of Cudgle action going on with your barbarian race wars too.                        </div>

                            You forgot the Leiber and Moorcock influences...<br/>
<br/>
The original D&amp;D seems, quite obviously, to be a pastiche of Fritz Leiber and Robert E. Howard adventure stories, set in a Tolkeinian world of Moorcockian morality, using Jack Vance's magic system, redacted for multiple protagonists. No wonder things are confused.<br/>
- Ken Hite<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I think that any attempt to get at a central theme for a world built to support characters romping around killing things and taking their stuff is doomed to failure. I think that, instead, what you can find are the themes common to all fantasy. Which are about the mystery of magic, and socio-political-racial strife. What's Awesome to focus on in Greyhawk? Well, the Invoked Devastation! Is it blandly ambiguous? Well then it's crying out for you to figure out why it happened and what it means to the current political situation.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, the thing that I find most interesting about Greyhawk is that the area detailed was once under the rule of a single empire, almost entirely. So what you have at the time of play is a "Balkanization" (to use a Travellerism) of this empire mostly along racial lines, demarked in most cases by religious differences. Some of which are foemented and highlighted by the rise of the evil demigods in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Dude, want to play in Greyhawk? I'll have no problem finding things to do with it.<br/>

                            My off-the-cuff summary of Greyhawk<br><br>Since Greyhawk is the world that co-evolved with Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, most of its basic tropes have been lifted and dropped right into other generic D&amp;D fantasy settings. Many of the details exist solely to support the odd conventions of the D&amp;D rules. For instance, every leader is some sort of high-level PC class. Still, there are a few things that are relatively unique to Greyhawk. <br><br>It is a world in decline. Long ago the big magical empires wiped each other off the face of the map, the survivors fled east into the eastern end of the continent called the Flaeness, which is the only developed part of the campaign world. Since then, smaller "big" empires have already come and gone in the Flaeness.  This of course, means there are a bunch of powerful treasures and magics, the likes of which cannot be created anymore, stashed away in ancient dungeons waiting to be discovered.<br><br>More than other, sanitized D&amp;D settings, it features the issue of race. There are four major human races which are (refreshingly) not 100% analogous to real-world racial groups (as well as three lesser races that are pretty much based on earth peoples). By now, they've all pretty much intermingled throughout the Flaeness and race isn't a big deal, but having the history of migrations and the cultural intermingling in place gives surprisingly plausible reasons for current political setups. It also gives us...<br><br>The Scarlet Brotherhood are a mysterious organization of Suel (the blond-haired, blue-eyed race) martial artist race supremacists who seem to have their fingers in much of the bad evilness going on in the southern Flaeness, particularly the slave trade. I dunno, the combination of Western fascists with Eastern fascists makes for fun villains.<br><br>There's Iuz the Old and Overking Ivid too, but they're relatively generic big bads.<br><br/>Yeah, the fact that the Circle of Eight, led by Mordenkainen -- Gary Gygax's own character -- are not necessarily good is always interesting.<br/><br/>Carl Sargent probably gets the credit for making Greyhawk darker and less silly than its original incarnation. Under his editorship, the Greyhawk Wars (a big meta-plot thing) occurred and the bad guys nearly won.<br/><br/>Really though, the whole thing is constructed for the sole purpose of justifying, "Why do we adventure?" It's best left sitting in the background while various bizarre dungeon crawls and evil humanoid exterminations play out.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Okay, so you've got awful names for countries and cities like the Grand Duchy of Geoff and the Gnarley Forest, you've got grandiose villains beyond redemption popping up every third Thursday, and you've got random bits of fantasy novels crammed into the setting. <br/><br/>It's obviously a dreamworld.<br/><br/>Greyhawk is where all the fledgling heroes go when they dream.  Here in Greyhawk the villains are capital-E Evil, the heroes are Big Damn Heroes.  Everyone else are either people to save or creatures serving Evil.  The setting doesn't have to make sense because it's all a dream.  <br/><br/>Greyhawk is obviously the fantasy setting for Lacuna.<br/><br/>That's where I would start with Awesome-i-fying Greyhawk.                        </div>

                            I'd dump the crap elements like the Grand Duchy of Geoff if we're going to awesome-o-fy it.  Assuming this is a remake along the lines of Battlestar Galactica, let's grab the core ideas and build from there.<br/><br/>1 - Balkanization.  Everything used to be part of a great Empire, not that long ago (a few generations)--and every place has its own special Imperial heritage, myth, and rationale for being the center of a new Empire.  This is deeply ingrained.  Everyone wants the throne.  Intergenerational hatreds, pacts, oaths, and feuds are rampant.  No one group is strong enough to win, so alliances and leagues are necessary.  But these are ever-shifting.<br/><br/>2 - Oaths and Pacts.  Some of the ancient oaths are magically binding on various parties, nations, or races if invoked by the proper beneficiaries or heirs.  If you can dredge up the right lore on the oaths, that is.  You might rip the Dark Ages: Fae for ideas on Stone, Iron, and Gold Oaths.<br/><br/>3 - The Imperial capital was Greyhawk, the city of faded glory.  The prize for the various contenders.  Held, looted, sacked, and fought over like an old bone, over and over.<br/><br/>4 - Hatred.  Since hatred is fed and sealed with generations of border wars, insurgency, assassination, torture, massacre, and mass sacrifice, the evil demigods and spirits are currently ascendant.<br/><br/>5 - Adventuring.  Aside from the need for mercenaries and magistrates, there's a demand for ancient secrets both to validate claims on the throne and to dig up artifacts and lore that might give one side the necessary edge.<br/><br/>6 - Pre-load Feud:  Players all start with a bloodfeud against another nation and must take a named NPC or small group of NPCs as an enemy.  Bonus is double experience, maybe, and favored enemy bonuses applied against these foes.<br/><br/>7 - Pre-load Allegiance:  Players each favor one of the factions or nations striving for the throne.  Neutrality is possible, but if it becomes known, that position becomes a social stigma.  Give experience for helping one's chosen faction in some way.<br/><br/>8 - Magic is Degraded.  Compared to the arcane might of the good old days, magic is a weak sister.  Except for blood magic and magic that draws off the power of feuds and division.<br/><br/>9 - The Land is Wounded.  Individual nations take on something of the nature of their people, their oaths, their hatreds, and their dreams.  So each nation may have subtly different laws of magic, for instance, or may twist with the moral fabric of its people.<br/><br/>10 - A Ray of Hope.  Old Imperial banners, magics, and gear, if used selflessly to heal the land.  Maybe.                        </div>

                            I had considered Greyhawk as the setting for my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/dawnoffire/" rel="nofollow"><b>Dawn of Fire</b></a> campaign.  <br/><br/>The concept is that dragons suddenly start multiplying quickly, and before anyone quite realizes it, dragons sweep through and conquer the surface world.  The PCs survive by going into a remote underground hideaway, taking with them a band of surviving people of various races.  So it's a reversal of D&amp;D where you're running down into dungeons to get away from the dragons, and taking the survivors with you.  So the PCs become dungeon inhabitants, slowly civilizing their home.  <br/><br/>So, the surface of Greyhawk wouldn't be very important except for flashbacks and cultural roots.  But it would serve as a backdrop.                        </div>

That sounds a lot like Birthright (especially near the beginning and the end of your list).  Not that that's a bad thing--I liked Birthright.  Frankly, I think a lot of vanilla fantasty settings could be awesomified by making them more like Birthright.                        </div>

                            Birthright was pretty cool. I dug its take on ethnicities and demihumans and monsters. I would totally like to score a box cheap someday.

                            Okay, so getting one of the Vecna artifacts is like the culmination of years' worth of slaying stuff to be awesome enough to deserve it. But, being good Narr monkeys, we know the good stuff <i>starts</i>with just giving the players what they want and seeing where the story goes from there.<br><br><b>The Hand And The Eye</b><br>A <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> one-sheet<br><br/>Long time ago, at the cusp of world domination, the archlich Venca's body was sundered, and in a perversion of the Osiris myth, the pieces seek to reunite so that Vecna may be reborn. The PC sorcerers have voluntarily grafted one of the relics of Vecna to themselves to gain personal power.<br/><br/>The relics are obviously Parasite-type demons, and have to be the character's starting demon. Whether the character amputated his own flesh just for the graft, or used it to replace an already-missing part is at the player's discretion. It's recommended that the infamous Hand and Eye of Vecna be the first two relics selected, with other parts invented as necessary to accommodate additional players. Use the D&amp;D texts' description of powers for inspiration, but certainly don't slavishly adhere to these either. (For reference, the canonical lesser relics of Vecna, as described in the adventure <i>Die Vecna Die!</i>, are the <i>scalp of Vecna</i>, the <i>first digit [thumb] of Vecna</i>, the <i>second digit [index finger] of Vecna</i>, the <i>third digit [middle finger] of Vecna</i>, the <i>right eye of Vecna</i>, the <i>molar of Vecna</i>, the <i>incisors of Vecna</i>, the <i>foot of Vecna</i>, the <i>heart of Vecna</i>, the <i>skin of Vecna</i>, and the <i>last digit [pinkie] of Vecna</i>. But seriously, don't use <i>all</i> of these in a given game.)<br/><br/>Reimagining Greyhawk<br/><br/>The game is assumed to take place on Oerth, but you may want to avoid setting it in the Flaeness to avoid getting tripped up with creative baggage. You could set it someplace else on the continent of Oerik, perhaps west of the Twin Cataclysms, or set it in a different era than the standard Greyhawk campaign, perhaps long before the Twin Cataclysms occurred.<br/><br/>As described in <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>, the tidy dichotomy of quaint non-human "races" is right out. If desired, demi-humans must be drifted into either genuine human beings bearing a shared, ununusal culture and phenotype (recommended for halflings) or alien, terrifying anthropomorphic nature spirits, (recommended for elves) unsuited for PCs and handled mechanically as demons. (But see the first three Lore descriptors in <i>S&amp;S</i> for exceptions!) Golblinoid races and their ilk are replaced by various bands of mongrel near-men, similar to those in proper sword &amp; sorcery. Other "monsters" are handled as types of Immanent demons.<br/><br/>(As a fun aside, in this setting an NPC like Iuz the Old, technically a demon in D&amp;D terms, is actually a powerful sorcerer with the Half-Breed descriptor, who gets his power from his Demon Lord consort Zuggtmoy in a clear example of the classic "demon girlfriend" of core <i>Sorcerer</i>.)<br/><br/>Humanity is defined as the ability to freely, bodily carry out one's own desires. At zero humanity, the graft (or whatever) usurps control of the host, horrifyingly trapping him as a slave to his own flesh. Humanity is gained by successfully using the demons as mere tools towards achieving one's own (original) goals. Humanity is lost when the sorcerer compromises his goals for new goals (presumably made available by the demon's power) and generally allowing the line between the demon's personality and his own to blur.<br/><br/>The relic demons have a shared Desire to reunite by means of all being grafted to the same host. Vecna is reborn and basically destroys the world if a) all grafts are bound to the same host, and b) the host hits 0 Humanity.<br/><br/>Unlike the D&amp;D rules, hosts are not necessarily killed if a relic is violent severed from their body, since they're sorcerers and can do all that death-defying willpower stuff. This also keeps players from being eliminated if a sorcerer is making progress on the path of collecting all the relics.<br/><br/>It's important to emphasize the morally "Grey" aspect of Greyhawk in this game. In particular, the institutions of Law should be portrayed in an unpleasant light, with members of civilization's establishments being pompous, self-righteous fuckwits, only scarely preferable to the inhuman horrors of chaos. (Clerics of Pholtus are good candidates here.) The concept of "good" is only possessed by individuals, those exceedingly rare individuals fortunate enough to remain innocent (and frankly naive) of the ancient evils that permeate this world. Protecting these individuals from harm probably counts for Humanity gain, too.<br/><br/>Most importantly, this game is "no myth," with elements from the existing Greyhawk setting not being a part of the world unless explicitly brought in by players.<br/><br/>Recommended reading for tone: <i>Vecna: Hand of the Revenant</i>, Iron Hammer Graphics, 2002.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
