                    I promised in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1825&amp;page=1#Item_29" rel="nofollow">another SG thread</a> that I'd post some "Buzz uses indie thinking with HERO AP. Apologies in advance for the length of this. Vanilla is limiting the length of comments, so I'm breaking this up over the next few posts.<br/><br/>This past Friday I ran the first session of a short Star HERO campaign for my regular HERO group. We play biweekly and usually do supers, though we do have a Fantasy HERO campaign that we rotate in occasionally. I've been with this group for almost four years now.<br/><br/>I rarely GM HERO, and this was the first time I'd ever run a Heroic game (as opposed to Superheroic). I tried to leverage some of my nascent Indie/Forge-fu. The group has a lot of "bad" habits, IMO, and I wanted to use some new techniques and see how they reacted. I know that Mr. Holmes says "you can't sneak up on mode," but I wanted to try getting away from our usual "Push players through the plot and fudge while doing so." I'm not sure I actually accomplished this. Overall, I wasn't too happy with the results, though my players claim they had fun.<br/><br/>So, the players...<br/><br/>* Steck: Steck was playing our starship captain, Amelia Bjorn. She's got a DNPC parrot, Marvin, who has been with the ship for decades.<br/>* Bart: Steck's husband, playing Dr. Emily Summerland, the ship's medic. A malpractice suit has blemished her career.<br/>* Mike: Playing disgraced ex-marine colonel Eas E. Slutt (yeah, that's his name, and he took it as a Disad), the ship's weapon expert. He hopes to one day clear his name.<br/>* Kathy: Mike's wife, playing a fex (feline race), is the ship's cook. She's also a talented hacker and budding information-broker.<br/>* Jason: Playing the ship's engineer, is a "space dwarf" (basically), and owns a mining/cargo mecha (Jason was insistent that he get to have a mech in this campaign). Jason is actually an operative for his planet's government, who are currently involved in a cold war with an opposing planetary faction.<br/><br/>The setting is Hero Games' Terran Empire, filtered through Traveller. I slimmed down the races a bit and added Niven's Kzin and the Fraal from Alternity's Star*Drive setting. The PCs are the crew of the IMS Beggar's Banquet, a rickety old free trader.<br/><br/>In prepping the session, I tried to make use of Chris Chinn's advice on Flag Framing and the Conflict Web. So, rather than cerate some sort of overall plot, I made up the following:<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.buzzmo.com/starhero/ap/Conflict-Web.gif" rel="nofollow">A relationship map of the PCs and NPCs</a><br/>* <a href="http://www.buzzmo.com/starhero/ap/Disad-Flags.gif" rel="nofollow">A list of all their Disadvantages</a><br/>* <a href="http://www.buzzmo.com/starhero/ap/Disad-Map.gif" rel="nofollow">A disadvantage map for the PCs.</a><br/><br/>The last was kind of an experiment. The color of the Disads indicates their point value, from little (green) to lots (red). Their position indicates (sorta) how much they relate to each other, in terms of similarity or opposition. I was pretty much flying by the seat of my pants here to see if this would be an at all useful tool. As you can tell, I was using HERO's Disads as my character flags. Whether this was a good idea or not, I dunno. They seemed the most obvious aspect of the system to use.<br/><br/>The basic situation is...<br/><br/>Steck's mom had been a sometime smuggler for many decades. Recently, she'd finally been caught and was under "house arrest," i.e., unable to leave her current planet of residence. However, she had recently outfitted the Banquet with a near-state-of-the-art displacer drive, and had recruited Steck to assemble a new crew. Before she could make clear to Steck what exactly is going on, she died under mysterious circumstances. So, Steck inherited the ship.<br/><br/>I then wanted to start off with everyone as part of the crew and get going on the main "bang," but the players seemed interested in playing out how they joined the crew. So, I offered the idea of rp'ing their job interviews with Steck. These scenes were mostly:<br/><br/>Steck: "What do you have to offer as a member of my crew?"<br/>Player: "I'm good at x, y, and z."<br/><br/>â€¦followed by quirky personality stuff. Jason acting the grumpy dwarf; Mike being very military ("Sir, yes sir!"); and Bart being very polite. Kathy just came on board and started cooking. Steck: "That'll work."<br/><br/>Kathy also did make a point of doing some background investigation into Steck's mom before her interview. She found out that Mom had been seen meeting with a hzeel (think Ferengi) and his kzin bodyguard.                </div>

                            With the crew assembled and staking out quarters for themselves, I started pulling out the "bangs."<br/><br/>Imperial Security Police Major Alyssa Barth arrives with some red shirts, a security robot, and a Mind Police telepath. She informs Steck that the autopsy on Mom reveals that she died from a destructive upload, i.e., her brain was removed and scanned into a digital medium, though attempts were made to cover up signs of the procedure. (Yes, I stole this from Transhuman Space. I love THS.) Maj. Barth suspects this is some sort of ruse for Mom to circumvent the terms of her house arrest, and thus is very suspicious of Steck. She demands that her telepath be allowed to interview the crew, and that her security 'bot accompany the ship on any trips made for the time being.<br/><br/>Steck agreed to all of this.<br/><br/>The 'bot, of course, is a sleeper agent for Jason's enemies. Nobody knows this yet.<br/><br/>I also had Maj. Barth warn Steck that a notorious hzeel gangster was spotted on-planet, with sort of a wink-wink, nudge-nudge that Barth suspected Steck already knew this and that she'd nail her if they were caught together.<br/><br/>So, Barth, the telepath, and the 'bot board the ship and start looking around. All of the players had scattered to different parts of the ship, so I had individual scenes with each of the NPCs running into them separately. The 'bot pretty much just toured the ship in silence, but the telepath and Maj. Barth did some interaction. I somehow managed to lose the sheet for the telepath, so I winged it. I'm pretty sure I WAY overestimated his Telepathy dice.<br/><br/>Jason: In the engineering area, building a hyper-beer still on to the hyperdrive. Since he was alone, I had his superiors contact him. (I was assuming some sort of secret interstellar pocket communicator, but I think I'll need to re-think that.) They ask if he's obtained employment on Steck's ship (seemed logical to me they would be behind it, Jason seemed okay with that idea). They then tell him that they've tracked down some sort of illegal weapon that's going to be moved off-planet, probably by his ship. Orders: obtain the weapon for us.<br/><br/>Jason was a little taken aback that I was doing this in front of the other players, but I had tried to make clear that there'd be no secrets in my game. It happens in our other games and it drives me nuts.<br/><br/>When the telepath came in, it was easy for him to totally read Jason's mind (again, I gave him way too many dice). However, I figured that this would really ruin Jason's fun, and I started fudging, to my own chagrin. Basically, the telepath gets the info from Jason, but isn't telling his superior for some reason.<br/><br/>Mike: Cleaning up one of the laser turrets. The telepath recognizes Mike's PC and psionically notifies Maj. Barth. Maj. Barth turns out (I decided) to be ex-marine as well, and served at the same time Mike was disgraced. Mike had bought a Reputation and Rivalry for his PC, so I figured Barth could fill both roles. We have a scene where Maj. Barth marvels at how such a total failure could have managed to find a job, and Mike fumes, vowing that he's going to clear his name someday. <br/><br/>Kathy: The 'bot eventually plunks itself down in the mess hall. Kathy is nonplussed. The telepath arrives and starts scanning her. He picks up on her "information broker" vibe and indicates that the Imperial Police would happy take her on as an informant. Kathy says she'll think about it. While getting the mess together, Kathy also installs some spybots in the ship's computer.<br/><br/>Steck: Pretty much the whole info-dump from Barth mentioned above.<br/><br/>Bart: His PC is a born spacer, so he has her stateroom set up for zero-g. The telepath comes by, and Bart won't even open the door (has "Hates Imperial authority figures" as a Disad). The telepath scans her from outside (again, that probably shouldn't have worked), and senses much hostility.<br/><br/>So, the PCs get their various sections of the ship in order, and the police, sans â€˜bot, leave.<br/><br/>Marvin the parrot is trained to turn on the PA and alert everyone when the comm light blinks, and starts squawking that there's an incoming transmission ("Blinking light! Blinking light!"). It's a text transmission of a cargo manifest for a bunch of low-berth modules (cryo-sleep, i.e., "coach class") marked as "Paid." Obviously, this is the deal Mom had set up. The players realize that the new displacer drive upgrade must have been the advance payment.<br/><br/>Come nightfall, the cargo gets delivered, and, naturally, the hzeel and his bodyguard are behind the deal. They muscle their way onto the ship as the low-berth modules are baing loaded, manhandling Steck as they do so. Mike tries to stop them, but the kzin rolls better than he does. This was also the point when I really started blanking on the rules, so the Mike-kzin altercation is handled with basic STR v. STR rolls, instead of a Grab maneuver.<br/><br/>Once on the ship, the hzeel reveals that he had a deal with Mom. In exchange for the new drive, her ship will transport the hezeel, his bodyguard, and his cargo to an as-yet undisclosed location to complete an unspecified transaction. The low-berth modules are a front, and the hzeel has already filed a forged flight plan for them.<br/><br/>Jason has his mech computer scan the cargo. Naturally, there's a sealed, un-scanable case inside one of the low-berth modules. This must be the weapon!<br/><br/>Steck agrees to honor the deal, but notifies the hzeel and kzin that there's a police 'bot on board. The hzeel orders his kzin to check it out, and ducks into a passenger stateroom. So... more fudging on my part. The 'bot has mysteriously powered down and seems totally dead. The kzin is concerned, but figures they can just space the thing before it powers back up. The ship takes off.<br/><br/>Mike and Jason haul the 'bot down to the cargo bay. Scanning the 'bot reveals some programming that is obviously linked back to Jason's enemy faction. Better space this thing, quick!<br/><br/>Of course, that's when it activates... and so ensues one of the shittiest combats I've ever run. I biff a LOT of rules ("How does Entangle work again?"), and the Big Hitter police 'bot turns out to be a Big Wuss. It uses capturefoam to immobilize Jason (the Entangle), but Jason has a Mind Link to his mech he uses to have it attack the 'bot. Granted, there's no way this should have worked, given how Jason built the mech and its computer, but I'm oblivious. So, the mech bear-hugs the 'bot and Mike shoots it a few times. End of combat.<br/><br/>So, the journey continues. The upgraded drive for the Banquet has some Limitations that should make the ride kind of bumpy, reflecting that it's a little worse for wear and doesn't interface with the aging Banquet all that well: activation rolls, unlucky, required crew, etc. However, I realize that any serious problems and the players will never get to the delivery point. On top of this, according to the Terran Empire map, the player's starting planet and the destination planet is ten days at max speed. I realize that I'd be compressing this anyway since a whole lot of nothing would probably happen, so we fudge again and it only takes most of a day, with minimal drive mishaps.                        </div>

                            Meanwhile, Jason receives another transmission from his superiors. They provide specs on the secret weapon: it's a planet-killing nanobot device of possible Ancient origin. Yes, the nano-killer weapon is a cliche, as is tech from the Ancients. Jason's reaction was pretty much, "Oh, a black-goo nanoweapon. Got it."<br/><br/>Once at the destination system, the hzeel provides the final rendezvous coordinates: a dense asteroid field. There, he makes contact with the buyer via an encrypted transmission that Kathy is unable to decipher in the time she has to monitor it. A big, organic-looking ship comes into view in the main viewport. Mike biffs his KS: Military World roll (the closest the group had to a useful skill for this), and has no idea what species' ship it might be.<br/><br/>Which becomes meaningless a few moments later as the comm screen comes on. The buyers are Xenovore pirates. Xenovores are the Terran Empire's BBEG, basically civilized versions of Giger's Alien.<br/><br/>And that's where we stopped. I'd say we ran from about 8pm to 11:30pm.<br/><br/>So, why was I so disappointed?<br/><br/>First off, I had thought that I was setting up a situation, but presenting it felt more like a plot. I wasn't fudging (many) rolls, but I felt like I was fudging details and events (such as the 'bot fiasco). I didn't want to just pull them from A to B to C, but that's what I felt like I ended up doing. I partly think this was just poor timing of all the bits I had wanted to use, partly fear of improvising.<br/><br/>Second, the players and I seemed to be working at cross-purposes. I wanted to "spill my guts" and give them all the basic info about the situation so we could get to the point where they took that info and had to make some decisions. They seemed to want to go through the whole process of figuring out the hook. "What can I find out about the mother?" "I want to scan the hold and see if I can find anything." I honestly started to feel bad that I was just giving it all to them; it's like they wanted to work for it.<br/><br/>Conversely, sometimes I would lay what I thought was some big event on them (e.g., "The police want to leave an armed 'bot on your ship for the duration"), and they'd respond with, "Okay. I head back to my quarters and make my bed." There were dead spots when I figured they'd want to take action, but would just kind of sit there waiting for me to move on.<br/><br/>Third, we hardly rolled any dice. Granted, this is usually how our games go, but I didn't want this game to be like that. It just seems pointless to me to play such a crunchy system like HERO and then ignore most of it. Of course, the fact that I managed to almost completely blank on all the rules didn't really help this situation. On top of this, I forgot to use my GM screen, and my copious notes and NPC sheets worked against me, in that it took me forever to find what I needed at any given time.<br/><br/>Lastly, just the fact that they looked as listless as I often feel during our games. I know I shouldn't have been expecting all-night gamergasms from them, but I really didn't want to see the usual tired faces and flipping through rulebooks. Of course, I was probably suffering from high expectations, like I was going to "show them how's it's really done" or something. I dunno.<br/><br/>So... I'm hoping to rectify this in time for the next session (many weeks away in our rotation). I'm cutting myself some slack given how infrequently I GM, much less GM a homebrew scenario. Still, I want figure out how to pull this off more successfully.                        </div>

                            Buzz,<br/><br/>I feel your pain. I'm generally of the suspicion that all of us have to attempt to run one "I'll use indie Nar techniques to 'fix' an otherwise poorly-focused traditional system!" game before seeing for ourselves how the latter system is ultimately baggage.<br/><br/>So, the issue here is not that the game is "not-fun," but that you think it should be more fun, like an engine firing on all cylinders? Right?<br/><br/>Lots of cool stuff going on here. I don't know what to suggest other than make sure your players have buy-in to a particular creative agenda. It sounds like you guys enjoy one another's company enough to tolerate a fair amount of pretty marginal play punctuated by the occasional really cool thing. But that's also going to make getting critical feedback from your players a little tricky.<br/><br/>I'll leave it to somebody more fluent in Hero to suggest how best to drift that system to support a particular CA. Which CA, I can't really determine from your write-up, which bugs me.                        </div>

Yes, though the game certainly felt "not-fun" when I was running it. I was relieved when we got to a point where I could call it quits.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that I'm not trying to force some CA on the group. I was more trying to just avoid the common HERO situation of plowing through a pre-determined plot while you wait for the fights. Chinn stated that his ideas were applicable to both Sim and Nar, so I figured they should be usable no matter how we ended up playing. Not to mention, his methods are less prep-intensive, which is very appealing for HERO, and already very complex game.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>But that's also going to make getting critical feedback from your players a little tricky.</blockquote>
I asked them to email me feedback, and the responses I got were all positive. Not very critically useful, but positive. (Of course, they say positive things about sessions I find pretty boring, so I dunno.)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>I'll leave it to somebody more fluent in Hero to suggest how best to drift that system to support a particular CA. Which CA, I can't really determine from your write-up, which bugs me.</blockquote>
I'm not really sure, either, unless we just say Sim. I talked about this same group in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19543" rel="nofollow">a thread over on the Forge</a>, and Ron basically called us "mildly incoherent," which seems to fit. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

They may not have understood what options were available to them-- perhaps they expected this to be the (usually reluctantly tolerated) GM NPC who travels with the party.<br/><br/>The not rolling dice and feeling listless may be related.  Perhaps, if you make up a quick reference of a few key tests you expect next session, you can make sure the rules get used.  Your habit of rolling in the open might help them see that the adventure depends on the dice, not just pre-plotting.<br/><br/>Hopefully, the stuff you play out next session will catch them (people expect dice for combat); plus, introducing new bangs that hit on the same stuff as last time might help emphasize the different nature of the game you're planning.<br/><br/>Scott                        </div>

                            Buzz, this sounds like a stupid question, but do they realize that they're supposed to be making decisions?  It's a feature of thoroughly-enculturated gamers that they perceive many "choices" as nothing of the sort, with only one option being an acceptable answer.<br/><br/>To me, it seems like you tried to creep up on the bang(s).  Were I you, I would start using some heavy scene framing to cut past the drek and head right into the bangs.                        </div>

                            Interesting.  I'm a fairly experienced Hero GM, and I've got some notes.  Incidentally, just last week I ran a space opera HERO System pickup game.  It was an original series Star Trek scenario that I had prepared for convention games.  I posted about the run on my LiveJournal as <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/43803.html" rel="nofollow"><b>"Ethical Dilemmas in Star Trek"</b></a>.  <br/><br/>As for your run...  In my opinion, you have too many plots and especially too many scenes for only one characters.  It seems to me that you introduced a lot of elements, and tried to drop things (like the telepath and the police robot) because you didn't know where they would go.  This made for a bunch of half-hearted dropping of stuff, rather than strong follow-through.  <br/><br/>You also are trying to put some culpability on the players for not wanting to get the information too easily, but I am skeptical of this. It would have been pretty trivial for you to simply have a message from Amelia's mom to her explaining what she was doing and what she wanted her daughter to do.  However, you kept everything a secret until the last minute -- not even knowing who they were meeting before they came on the comm screen, etc.  If you want the players making important decisions, they need to know what's going on.  At the least, they should know more than any of the individual NPCs.  <br/><br/>Especially, I think having Major Barth come in with authoritative demands and bring in a telepath was over the top in overpowering the PCs -- especially with them having no way to resist.  (Really, that one seems sort of obvious to me.  It's not a bang as far as I can tell.)  <br/><br/>The one-on-one scenes are also problematic, I think.  The HERO System doesn't have a way for non-involved players to affect the scene, so it favors having a more central situations which the PCs interact over.  You want to look for ways to enhance the PCs ties and conflicts with each other.  The disad map has some nice ones: the clashes over religion and violence, notably.  <br/><br/>Lastly, if you're going to use the Hero System, then your combats should be fun and involving.  Never throw in a fight just to have a fight -- your fights should generally be setpieces.  A minor fight in the Hero System is a real waste.  Minimize your fight-possible NPCs, but make sure that the ones which might fight will be interesting opponents.  <br/><br/>As for how to proceed from here.  First of all, the players need an info dump, stat.  I'd start with an emergency action scene as they face off and the pirates give them a strict countdown.  The obvious way out is for them to use the weapon on the pirates.  I'd go do that -- if they have a superweapon, it's a seed for a lot of future possibilities.  Once the emergency is past one way or another, then you need to spill the beans on the background here -- the likely source is from interrogating Zee'Gansh and searching his stuff.  If you don't have a good explanation to spill to them, then you need to come up with one.  You might want to announce a retcon or two if you have some trouble.                        </div>

Agreed. The weird thing is that I intended to do this while prepping, but come game time, everything came out in dribs and drabs. I guess it was my old-school habits coming through, e.g., wanting to build up tot he "big reveal" or whatever.<br/><br/>Now, you're right that I shouldn't blame the players for this. Still, I did feel like they were fighting me a bit. For example, I was going to start off assuming everyone was already part of the crew, but Bart insisted that his PC had not yet joined and wanted to play out being hired. So, we went with the interviews. Then, everyone almost immediately went off to separate parts of the ship to do their own thing.

Very true, especially since I over-estimated the telepath's powers. I guess I was hoping they'd resist. You know, ask if Barth had a warrant or something. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>

Yes. Again, I had hoped to avoid this, as our regular sessions almost always involve slowly going around the table, one by one, playing solo scenes with everyone's unrelated plot lines.

It's entirely possible. This is a group of long-time HERO players and GMs used to heavily plotted scenarios. As I mentioned to John, it's also a group whose PCs generally act wholly independently until it's time for combat.<br/><br/>Obviously, though, I ran this session pretty poorly, so I'm not going to pin everything on them. I capitulated to our default habits too easily, and was not as ready with the rules as I should have been.

Tell me how this plays out. What sort of involvement do the players of characters not in the scene have? Do they sit there passively enjoying the scene as audience members? Do they sort of start drifting off in disinterest, as though they're under some sort of gag rule? Do they comment and make suggestions about what's happening?<br/><br/>Long-time gamers are generally going to have their heads in the sand about how they can participate as players even when their characters couldn't "realistically" affect anything, until they're encouraged to do so. Some people may really dig the <span style="color: #FF0000;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">pawn</span> actor</span> stance encouraged as the "best way" by many gaming texts, but as I see it it's prone to inducing creative blocking and a lot of boredom when all characters aren't present in the same scene. Compare to the attitude of "I'm Gonna Make You Awesome," where players are actively striving to be interested in the other guy.<br/><br/>So, um, what's the reward system in this game? Standard Hero-rules experience stuff? That might be the easiest thing to tweak to incentivize certain ways of playing over others.<br/><br/><i>Edited term goof to reflect what I originally meant.</i> </div>

Other than occasional commentary or rules-help, they have none. Any commentary is subject to "You're not there" dismissal. You essentially sit there and wait your turn. It's very common for people to literally sit and read a book while waiting for their turn.*<br/><br/>Remember when I said that Jason was surprised that I played out his "secret agent" stuff in front of the group? Did I also mention that one of the first things Kathy did was to pass me a note that read, "I want to investigate Amelia's mom."<br/><br/>There's a lot of secrecy in our regular games. In one of our Champions campaigns, there's whole subplots about Kathy's PC that the rest of us know nothing about, other than what we glean from her solo scenes with the GM.<br/><br/>Drives me bonkers.

I'm using standard HERO XP, but also Heroic Action Points (i.e., points that let you re-roll dice)... which I also completely forgot about during the session.<br/><br/><br/>* I ran BW for this group once (which they didn't really like), and one of the players did the "reading KOTD when I'm not in the spotlight" during that session. And this was "The Sword," which is a demo almost entirely dependent on active PvP conflict. I guess old habits die hard.                        </div>

Interesting.  Most of my HERO System experience was from Champions, where there's a lot of PC interaction.  Since the PCs pretty much trust each other, scenes were almost always open.  I think you should work to get the PCs to trust each other and work as a team, at least to a degree.  They may have conflicts, but those should generally be open conflicts rather than trying to work behind each others' backs.  <br/><br/>My first bit of advice: I'd start by dragging in the outlying member here...  Perhaps have the dwarf's bosses openly contact the captain for some sort of clear deal.  I don't know about the background, but it seems that they could be good guys and allies of the group.  Also, from the disad tree, the feline needs some sort of hook added to her character.                        </div>

A number of players still haven't fully fleshed out their PCs. Kathy's feline in particular has yet to really figure out what Disads she's going to take, ergo why she has so little on the Disdad map.<br/><br/>This was another issue. I wanted to really focus on using their Disads as inspiration for the situation, but a good number of players were really lax in actually sending me their PCs in advance.                        </div>

                            Mark,<br/>
<br/>
First, toldyaso. :-P<br/>
<br/>
OK, that's not too helpful. John and Larry are giving good advice above. But if what Larry is saying is true, and the players either are unaware that they're allowed to do things out of the scene, and play with author stance (not Pawn Stance, Larry, that's about having the character at player whim act sans respect for plausibility), and all of this stuff, you're going to have to show them that you want it.<br/>
<br/>
Show. Don't tell. You can talk till you're blue in the face, and it isn't going to matter. You have to demonstrate in actual play.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the best "clubs" you can use for being blunt about this sort of play:<br/>
<br/>
- Use third person narration instead of second person. This seems minor, but you'll find it's both hard to break out of the old habit and that people will definitely notice a difference. "You see a light ahead, what do you do?" becomes, "Your character sees a light ahead, what's he doing?" This tends to catapult players into thinking of their character as their character, and not as though they and their character are one and the same (so they don't have the "I can't do that because my character can't do that logic" going on in their head).<br/>
- Ask metagame questions and foster people talking about things when they're not in the scene. "Let's stop this scene for a second. What do you all think of what's going on?"<br/>
- Continue with your out of character player knowledge barrage. But step it up. Don't just reveal things about the player's secrets, reveal them about your plot (Larry or somebody hints at this above). That's the problem, they're still seeing you holding on to secrets, but they're not supposed to. For instance, "OK, we're going to have your character roll to see if he can determine that those are Kzinti ships, OK? Oh, failed? Well that's too bad, isn't it?"<br/>
- Ask a player if he'd rather just succeed at a die roll. "Is this dramatic to roll for the docking, or should we just say he does it and moves on?" For really high impact, do this with a combat. This way you can avoid the sorts of combats that John says aren't any fun to play out. Let the player decide. Or, heck, let the whole group vote. "Do you all want to see him beat up on this robot by the numbers or can we just narrate our way through it?"<br/>
- Ask players to frame scenes. Don't say, "What do you do next?" That won't cut it. Ask instead, "What sort of scene would you like to have next? What characters are in it?" If you really want to press them add, "What conflict do you want to resolve or set up with the scene?"<br/>
- Get really radical and ask Player A to frame for Player B. "What sort of scene should we have for his character?"<br/>
- Allow them to create the plot. "You know, the telepath would normally tell his boss, of course, what he's learned. But I think it would be more fun if there's some reason for him to hide that information. What interesting reason can we come up with for why he'd do that?<br/>
- Announce that you're changing your plans to fit the player's idea. "Hmm, I was going to have some murder mystery on Arcturus Station, but given that you've decided to head to Mora, I'm thinking now that we'll slant things into some political action. What do you think?"<br/>
<br/>
Note that I think that people get the idea that I use this stuff all the time in my games. I don't. Occassionally I'll pull something like this out. But mostly I only use it for demonstrative purposes. Yeah, I'm a real pedantic bastard about it. Like:<br/>
<br/>
Player: "Oh, the robot is a plant? Imagine that? I go make my bed."<br/>
Mike: "Huh, I thought that would make for some interesting decisions for your character, but apparently not? What should I be hitting you with then? What would you like to see?"<br/>
<br/>
Or even:<br/>
<br/>
Player: "Huh, the bot's a plant..."<br/>
Mike: "Yep. How do you feel about that?"<br/>
Player: "Uh, well, my guy goes back to his cabin..."<br/>
Mike (interrupting): "No, I didn't ask what your character feels like, I asked how you feel about it."<br/>
<br/>
You're a player in the game, too. If you want the other players to play in this particular style, you have to show them by the example of your play. Bangs alone won't do it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, your bang-fu is weak! That's OK, most everybody's is, even mine. The key is to keep on working at it. Keep in mind the two principles of a bang:<br/>
1. Unavoidable - even "walking away" is somehow dramatic.<br/>
2. Open-ended - not only don't you know what's going to happen, but you feel that the player will have to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've done this for a bit, you'll start to pick up on what sort of stuff interests the players, and the bangs will get better. As you say, the characters aren't communicating to you through either complete characters, or through using metagame methods. So it's no surprise you don't know where to hit them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and here's a mechanical note. Give the players 1 of your special reward points each time they play to one of their disads...whether to emphasize it, or to resist it! Like the guy with the code vs. killing. "The alien scum writhes before you, do you kill him or not? If you walk away and leave it to the other characters, no reward. But if you either stop them from killing it, or kill it yourself, you get a reward point!" Make him roll to kill the enemy if you want to keep with the HS rules. Even the fact that the player is rolling is interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Put it this way, in how many games have you ever seen anyone roll against their psych lims to overcome them? The rule is there to inform the player that they're generally not supposed to do so. So most HS play involves little rolling (this is a sim thing, if they are rolling, then they're probably gamists). Change that attitude, and reward players for character dynamism. This way each time the disad comes up, it's a decision point, not a "duh, he does what the psych lim says" moment.<br/>

By "barking up the wrong tree", you mean it sounds like they don't like getting out-of-character information during game, yes?  It does appear to be so.  <br><br>I guess it depends what you're looking for.  Buzz, are you looking for out-of-character play specifically, or is it a means to an end?  Also, Mike - why did you specifically suggest out-of-character techniques?  <br><br>Offhand, from what you say, I'd say that you should instead provide them with in-character information.  i.e. Give them a video recording of what the NPC did.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mike: Whoops! I actually meant "actor stance" there, which is what Mark's group (especially Bart, as noted above) seem to assume is the "one true way" to play RPGs. Not at all unusual, when the texts themselves sermonize about it.<br><br>Anyway, the general problem I'm seeing here (incoherency) is an very common one. For some reason, it's not always obvious to us longtime gamers what's going on here unless you've really assimilated all the Forge stuff about Social Contract as the outer and all-encompassing layer of the game. Let me try to explain my take on it, as I currently understand it.<br><br>Basically, a lot of gaming groups will change rulesets and genres and what not from time to time, and think of this as playing different games. But... they're still carrying forward all of original unspoken assumptions about the group's social contract, often from way back when. So, to a very real degree, they're still pretty much <b>playing the same game</b> they learned to play in the very beginning. Doesn't matter if you're calling it "D&amp;D" or "Champions," "sci-fi" or "horror," "rules-heavy" or "freeform." They're playing the game called "role-playing games," as though that's some monolithic, universally understood meaning, but where certain nebulously identified things that featured in previous games must arbitrarily be in place. It's a nasty circular definition.<br><br>My thought is that the only particularly good way to break out of this trend, short of some sort of unimaginably ideal pow-wow where you communicate everything you've learned about gaming, is to present players with a game that will in no way be mistaken as "the same old game." Games like <i>My Life With Master</i> or even <i>Donjon</i>, where the mechanics and narration structure are so radically different in an up-front and visible way, it just clearly communicates "we are playing a totally different sort of game, and that's okay and it can still be fun." Something where if they're not genuinely willing to try something new (despite claims to the contrary) they'll stamp their feet and bail out, and nobody's under any illusions.<br><br>I wish I knew of reliable ways to successful transform a clunky, traditional-style game into dazzlingly coherent, fresh gameplay. Mike's suggestions above are as excellent as you'll find to pursuing that end. But I don't have a lot of confidence in the "patch-kit" approach.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Any comments on how this worked for you.  I discussed mine a while ago on the Forge in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9812.0" rel="nofollow"><b>"Mike's Standard Rant #7: You Can't Sneak Up on Mode"</b></a>.  Since then, I've played MLWM with my RQ/Buffy group, and I played Dogs in the Vineyard with my HarnMaster/LotR/JB007 group, but I don't see that either changed our play patterns a whole lot.  We've all been having a lot of fun and I find our games very fresh, though.  <br><br>Mike's rant was preceded by a number of prior posts about unsuccessful attempts to sneak up on mode, where someone tried to lead his fellow gamers about the other ways to play.  However, I haven't heard a whole lot of success stories where players resistant to the idea were brought around by MLWM play (say).  From my observation, the people who like MLWM are the ones who are happy to try it.

As I commented in the sneaking up thread, it depends what you're trying for.  I agree that if you really want them to play MLWM, I think it's better to just try playing it.  If they don't like it, they don't like it.  However, if you just want fresh, fun gameplay, I think there is more than one way to get there.                        </br></br></div>

I was essentially using this question (and others, e.g., asking them to look at The Pool and give me their impressions) as sort of a litmus test to get an idea how interested they were in more Nar-leaning, less-mainstream play. I didn't have a specific need for OOC techniques in mind, though I had inklings of the kind of things Mike talks about above; I wanted to find out up-front whether they'd be at all amenable.<br><br>In general, though, my hope was not so much to drag them kicking and screaming into Nar play, but just run a game that wasn't based wholly on Illusionism, and in which the players got to be active participants, working together, rather than spectators kept mostly in the dark while waiting their turn.<br><br>A secondary goal was to test whether HERO is really for me anymore. I've been a big fan of the system for a long time and, unhealthy as it may be, slavishly buy the books. However, since dipping my toes into the indie pond, I've been looking at the many feet of shelf space devoted to heavy HERO tomes and wondering if it's all really necessary. That my HERO group's play has been unsatisfying for me for a while now isn't helping HERO's case all that much. <br><br>Ditto that in our regular games (run by Mike and Bart), we use maybe 10% of the HERO rules, assuming any dice get rolled at all, which seems utterly pointless to me. I find it extremely bizarre that there's such dedication in this group to a highly complex, page-heavy system that is mostly ignored.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I think I mentioned above running BW's "The Sword" for this group (well, a subset). It ended up not being much different from a typical dungeon-crawl. They also really didn't like DoW; "It gets in the way of the roleplaying." Granted, BW is not quite as radical as, say, <i>Universalis</i> or something. Given the general negative reaction to <i>The Pool</i>, though, I think the more radical stuff wouldn't go over well.<br><br>(Which, again, I find a little weird, as at least one player often complains about lack of input... while at the same time being afraid of <i>The Pool</i>.)                        </br></br></div>

                            Your experience with Burning Wheel's "The Sword" is eerily familiar. When I brought "Dogs in the Vineyard" the "old" group, at least one person became increasingly frustrated with how conflicts were resolved. At one point he exclaimed that the resolution system was "getting in the way of role-playing." I asked him to clarify what he meant by that, and basically he meant "me convincing you". Whether or not he realized that included bullying and physical intimidation and lots of talking that was aimed , I don't know. <br/>
<br/>
By contrast, when I ran the "Sword" for a demo at my FLGS no body had this problem. I might have been because I was running the game for people who sought out a new game to try. Instead of looking for reasons why the new game was bad according to their old experiences, they seemed to accept and even began to rely on the DoW as a mechanic. Which is what you really want to have happen, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I now know that Burning Wheel will probably evoke similar reactions among the same people in my "old" group. I can plan and prepare according to that.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also suddenly aware that the "old" group also slavishly purchased heaps of Hero and GURPS books. I doubt we used even 10% of the printed text in our play.                        </div>

Well, I think I can help with the part about making the players active participants.  First off, I've got an oldish essay on proactive PCs here: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/plot/proactivity.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Proactive PCs and Related Issues</b></a><br/><br/>More on that in a moment.  <br/><br/>Regarding the system test...  For what it's worth, I'm also a HERO System fan.  I have a credit in HERO System 5th edition (even though I prefer 4th), and for a long time it was my primary system of choice.  It all worked pretty well.  However, when I moved away from the group of grognard friends who played, I found that the players I liked just couldn't stomach learning it.  So I've generally moved to simpler systems, though I still run and play occaisionally at conventions or one-shots.  <br/><br/>For comparison, I've played recently with a group who are mostly into GURPS (which I'm not very fond of).  I've had some luck playing Dogs in the Vineyard and Dead of Night with them, though they were profoundly uninterested in, say, Hero's Banner.  <br/><br/>Going back to your game: Do you have their full sheets online?  I saw the disad map which was cool, but HERO powers/abilities are often better as flags than disads.  Do you have a plan for next time, and would you want feedback?                        </div>

Another good article on your site. Thanks!

I don't have their sheets online, but I can rectify that. I went with Disads as flags because a) they're usually "story" elements rather than capabilities, and 2) I wanted to hit them hard to avoid the "I don't do that 'cause it's my Psych Lim, duh" think you mentioned above. But, yeah, looking beyond them for flags is a very good idea.<br/><br/>As for feedback, heck yeah.<br/><br/>At this point, we've left off with the Xenovore pirates awaiting delivery of the super-weapon, the criminal and his kzin bodyguard on board, and Jason's PC under orders to secure the weapon for his government.<br/><br/>I was assuming that the Xenovores would want to ignore the deal, take the weapon, and eat everyone on board. I assume the players don't want to get eaten, and that the criminal and bodyguard (before they are betrayed by the Xenovores) will resist any attempt to prevent the deal from going down. So, lots of combat in airlocks and possibly some vehicle combat.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I have no idea.                        </div>

OK, here's my two cents.  <br/><br/>1) The Xenovores should expect to go through with the deal.  I'm assuming here that the PCs are going to reject giving the superweapon to the Xenovores -- so there's going to be conflict anyway.  This way the PCs are the ones who get to make the choice and screw over the opposition.  Let's say the Xenovores have made deals with the hzeel before and want to keep him as a useful contact.  However, to keep the pressue, though, the Xenovores can be very curt and say something like "Deliver the goods in five minutes or we will destroy you."  <br/><br/>2) Assume that there are way too many of the Xenovores, and that the PCs are probably going to have to use the superweapon on them.  In a fight, the Xenovores will try to disable the ship (but not destroy it for fear of losing the weapon), and then attack in waves.  Having a few waves of increasing toughness gives you a chance to twiddle their numbers and/or stats if you're having trouble with the combat rules.  <br/><br/>3) You need to work out a backstory that makes sense, and dump it to the players after the fight is over.  The best way for a dump is probably for the hzeel to spill the beans relatively easily (or have documents which can be found).  As I mentioned, the PCs should have more information than any of the NPCs.  <br/><br/><br/>So:  The hzeel reveals that it is selling the weapon to the Xenovores for Destron (these are the enemies of Skippy's people in Optimal, right?), on the condition that they use it to attack Optimal.  However, the weapon itself was stolen from a rogue Imperial project which had been taken over by a radical Christian doomsday cult. <br/><br/>Major Barth is actually working for cult elements within the Imperium.  (Note that based on disads we want to drag in religious conflict.  The cult should be nuts but have some degree of sensibility to them, such that there could be sympathetic NPCs among them.)  I don't know much about the empire or its religious background, so I'm not sure what their beliefs or causes should be exactly.  <br/><br/>Also, Steck's mom has actually been loaded onto the ship's computer as an AI.  She's currently undergoing a long re-adjustment and re-formatting process, but she will awaken sometime soon.  She didn't know anything about the Xenovore deal, but did have previous conflict with Maj. Barth.  (My logic is that if you have a family member, bring her in rather than leaving her as a big unknown.  It should be fun roleplaying to have Steck's mom as the ship's computer.)                        </div>

                            buzz, your description of "everyone waits an hour while I play through other people's scenes, plays their own scene for ten minutes, and then there's a fight" maps almost perfectly to one of my most successful (and most hair-pulling) games that I've ever run, my Adventure! Gotham City game. I post about it a lot because both its successes and its failures drive me absolutely bugnuts and I have a hard time grasping either one.<br/><br/>What was driving this structural choice in my game was not any dedication to any kind of narrative principle or indie hippie hoohaw, it was my dedication to the genre, where the heroes are broody loners with serious emotional problems and private lives that are not only kept highly private but which are deeply troublesome to them. I got some great characters designed to this standard, but it meant that outside of fighting crime together (although of course in Gotham City games there's no shortage of crime to fight) they didn't hardly do anything together.<br/><br/>I asked the group what they thought about this and they confirmed what I guessed from looking around the room during the game: they were largely bored during other people's individual scenes. The weird part is that they were so highly engaged in their individual scenes that there was insane mutiny threatened if I pulled the plug or even severely altered the project.  They wanted their 15 minutes. They wanted it bad.  The source material and my interpretation of it spoke so strongly to them that they were willing to sit there and read or chat about this and that, or play X-Box, or whatever they did when they were bored just so they could get to it.<br/><br/>The very simple method I've used to avoid this kind of thing in future campaign designs is JUST DON'T DO IT.  Make games where 'team' scenes are the norm and not the exception.  Minimize 'I go off and do this' scenes, use scene-level resolutions, summarize conversations, etc.<br/><br/>That to me is the best way to handle structural changes if they like the basic way the game is played but are sort of twiddling their thumbs waiting to actually play it.<br/><br/>All righty, hope that helped.                        </div>

Also, note that a lot of this will require practice as a GM.  I'm not a perfect GM by any means, but when I implement new tricks or whatever, sure some hit it out of the park on the first try, but a lot of time I have to simply try harder, try in new ways, etc to gain ground. Not every session is going to be 100% awesome, but at least you can learn from your mistakes to try to make the next session better.<br/><br/>So hopefully you're finding stuff to implement into your next game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Absotively.<br/><br/>Tangent...<br/><br/>You know, back in the day, I'd always thought I was a pretty hot shit GM. My players always told me I was really, really good. When I got back into gaming a few years back, I made a point to just be a player; I assumed I was still hot shit, and figured I should try life on the other side of the screen for a while. When I would feel unsatisfied while playing, I kept thinking, "I need to run a game for these guys and show them how it's done."<br/><br/>I'm realizing now that, as I've seen others in the same boat realize, I wasn't a hot shit GM; I was a hot shit storyteller and actor. My GM'ing was limited to heavy Illusionist story-telling and "explore the map and clear the level" D&amp;D with colorful accents.<br/><br/>Ergo, now that I've been digesting theory and new-school games and can better articulate what play excites me and what play doesn't, I'm realizing that I have a LOT of work to do and need to run a LOT more games. I need to re-learn how to be a hot shit GM WITHOUT relying on fudging and funny accents.<br/><br/>I can't convey how happy I am that I have resources like SG to draw upon as part of my re-education.                        </div>

                            A little necromancy here.<br/><br/>John, I used your ideas. We just finished the second session of the campaign and it went very well, a vast improvement over last time. There was more focus, a tense situation, and the players just ran with it. Had a nice big combat with PCs running all over the ship, cargo bays decompressing, some minor starship combat, tense debate, and some Han-Solo-esque maneuvers in an asteroid field. As an epilogue, I introduced the "You mom is the ship's computer thing," which we will pick up on next session.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for your help.
