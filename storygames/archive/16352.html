Furthermore, we all learn best the things that we discovered for ourselves. Therefore the exercises form a major part of this work; a definite attempt has been made to keep them as informative as possible and to select problems that are enjoyable to solve.</blockquote>\nThat got me thinking about GMing and learning to GM. I feel like the common answers to "how do I learn to GM better?" are:<br/><br/>"Play more"<br/><br/>"Play more, these games in particular"<br/><br/>The "these games in particular" bit is cool because it points out that some games give you tools or constraints that help you discover new things about GMing, but not everyone wants to pick up an entire new game and convince others to play just to learn some skill. Can we make "GMing exercises" that build a certain skill or help you see GMing in a different way? Can those exercises be at least semi-system-independent? (Like "this exercise is for drama-heavy games focused on personal goals and issues" or "this exercise is for action games with tactical positioning.")<br/><br/>So my challenge to you: I want to be a better GM. Give me exercises that will help build my GMing muscles.<br/><br/><strong>Edited to add:</strong> To clarify, neither of those answers is <em>wrong</em>, I just wonder if they could be more pointed or directed. My original though was people would tell me things like "run a session of a drama-y game, one where you've got a web of connected people, but use only one NPC if at all possible (anyone else should play a minor role). Think about how focusing on one part of the web of connections shifts it." People have far surpassed my expectations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373384/#Comment_373384" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T07:43:03+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  7:43AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2012 7:46AM by jenskot.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What GM muscles would you like to build?<br/><br/>(exercise one is before leaping to reply... stop yourself... pause... then ask clarifying questions to establish context and intent to make sure you are on the same page)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373392/#Comment_373392" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T08:13:02+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  8:13AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frame Scenes like practicing scales.

You get to observe another GM succeed or fail, you get to absorb the lessons of both, if you're playing a GMless game you get to baby-bird your own GM authority surrounded by tolerant peers and the ability to only 25% wreck the game. So, you know, play more.<br/><br/>More on point with your request, anything that helps you learn how to listen will make you a better GM. Improvisation, Toastmasters, Model UN, structured social activities that involve spontaneity and communication. Find one you like and become a better listener.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373434/#Comment_373434" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T10:56:59+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 10:56AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2012 11:06AM by sage.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, "play more" is totally a valid answer. I'm looking for <em>play</em> exercises. Or non-play too, I guess. I'm not saying those answers aren't useful, I just wonder if they could be more pointed? Like "play this way to see a different view on NPCs" or whatever.<br/><br/>In the text that prompted this Knuth breaks up all his exercises into numbered difficulty bands. I think that kind of applies here too: non-play exercises are generally easier (no need to waste someone else's time) but also less rewarding since you aren't actually doing it. Play exercises are generally more valuable, but require more investment.<br/><br/>This is probably all wrapped up in my personal experience, but the "exercises" I'm thinking of here are a lot like musical etudes or programming problems: you're putting the skill to work in a very directed way to grow it in a more general sense. I mean, from my personal experience: learning to play bassoon or code C is much easier when someone's pointing you at skills, giving you challenges of a sort, all designed to build certain parts of that skill.<br/><br/><br/>jenksot: you caught me! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I guess I was more excited to hear about what skills other people could suggest than any one in particular.

You can flesh out that one room as much as you like, but the only way to find out what's beyond it is by listening to the players and answering their direct questions. You can't make up anything outside the room unless a player establishes it or the player asks about it with absolutely no expectations (if they have expectations you have to use them)."

Each would teach one technique. I wrote a stupid little superhero game that was exclusively about bird-in-ear, for example.

During the session check your list often. If there's an opportunity for an NPC or force to do what you wrote down, make it happen. After the session look over which NPCs and forces moved towards their goals or accomplished them. How are these forces moving in your game?"<br/><br/>That's a bit of AW transplanted into a "try this and think about it" exercise. I love trying different games, but with limited time and gaming it's super useful to me to have a way of trying out these concepts and learning from them in the context of a game I'm already playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373449/#Comment_373449" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T11:35:05+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 11:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, The Upgrade may totally be the kind of thing I'm looking for.

Draw a relationship map for an ensemble TV show (<i>the Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Mad Men, Game of Thrones, Arrested Development, Community, Parks &amp; Rec, Battlestar Galactica</i>, etc).  Using that relationship map, frame an opening scene for an episode.  Make it as relevant to as many characters as possible.  <br/><br/>(rationale: I really love doing the prep for an IAWA chapter.  Plopping a bunch of brand-new characters and best interests onto an R-Map and then framing a tight first scene for them feels like running a brainsprint, like I've taken the 1-2 weeks of prep I do for a D&amp;D session and boiled it down into 5-10 minutes of intense thinking.)<br/><br/>2. If your game has a skill list or move list, write a list of "yes, buts" for each move or skill.<br/><br/>(I did this for my fictionful D&amp;D article and it definitely helped my play the next session.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>(exercise one is before leaping to reply... stop yourself... pause... then ask clarifying questions to establish context and intent to make sure you are on the same page)</blockquote>\nYes, this is a very important technique!

I really am. So in the last hour I came up with this (I'll edit it later to make it look pretty).<br/><br/><b>Setup</b><br/><br/>Decide on a Genre.<br/><br/>Gather 24 index cards together. Set them aside in groups of twelve. You will also need a timer, three coins, and three d6's. The coins represent players (or more specifically, their interest in the game.)<br/><br/>One is the Characters deck. On each of them write a character appropriate to the genre. Include a couple of traits and a general motivation.<br/><br/>One is the Setting deck. On each of them write a location appropriate to the genre. Include some general features.<br/><br/>You have ten minutes to create the decks. For every thirty seconds longer than this you take lose a player. To do this, turn a coin over to tails.<br/><br/><b>Play</b><br/><br/>Draw one setting and three characters. You have two minutes to frame a scene using that setting and involving at least two of the characters. For every thirty seconds longer than this you take lose a player.<br/><br/>When you are done, narrate the scene. Break it down into actions and reactions, and try to create a sense of buildup. When the scene reaches it's peak, there will undoutedly be a conflict brewing. Assign a die to each character and roll them. Whichever character rolls highest wins the conflict; narrate accordingly. Then, wrap up the scene. There's no time limit on this part but you must try to keep things moving: if you pause for longer than 30 seconds, lose a player.<br/><br/>Now, shuffle one of the characters back in the character deck. Draw a new one. Repeat the process until the story feels complete.<br/><br/>At any time, you can buy an extra thirty seconds to think by asking a question. Don't continue until you come up with an answer. Also, when you come up with something really juicy and satisfying, gain a player back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373533/#Comment_373533" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T17:47:04+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  5:47PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Sage, I think one of the biggest fears (for me at least) to experimenting with untried GM practices, was the effect on the other player's experience at the table. Often it was enough to play a new system and explain that I was as much a novice at implementing the new 'system' into our role-play, and thus be granted some leniency when things feel somewhat disjointed. So my first suggestion would be to second the practice of playing more and playing unfamiliar systems, but with the adage to everyone at the table that it is a practice run, with the expectation that after we share a meal and we talk about the things that worked and things that jarred. Thus play becomes the exercise, for both GM and players. We are still playing (and having fun) but we are also taking notice of our play and what is enhancing experience, and what is detrimental.<br/><br/>I like all the above exercises though! When I'm watching a particularly good series or movie or reading a book, I like to transpose the tense fiction resolution onto any given system that I'm learning. If that narration had been played out during a session, what mechanics / process / randomiser would have been instigated? I love to imagine 'what if' at a conflict driven moment. What if the hero had failed then? What antagonism is in the back of mind as GM? What would have the player been thinking as they pursed that flag? What is obvious in this scene? Unexpected? What has been re-incorporated? What choices would I have given the players? How would the 'conversation' of the table, the back and forth between the players and GM play out?<br/><br/>When characters are introduced in movies or books I like to ask myself are they protagonists or antagonists? What does their stat block / character sheet look like (system specific)? What are their flags? What do they want the story to be about? What are their goals? How can I challenge them? How will they be changed by the story that emerges? Then its exciting to see how they are challenged, or how they change and compare with my initial, intuitive response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373573/#Comment_373573" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T02:05:18+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  2:05AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you pick up a new game, try to play it exactly according to its text.  <br/><br/>Give it and the designer the benefit of the doubt and don't dismiss it or hack it until you've played it enough to understand what the designer's going for.<br/><br/>(This isn't really exercising an established muscle, rather it's a way to discover new muscles.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373594/#Comment_373594" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T05:49:23+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  5:49AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2012 5:50AM by zircher.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of cards (which I also have in abundance), I like throwing down some Rory's Story Cubes and building a scene from that.

It's called Playing with Intent. Feel free to whisper him or me for access to the text in progress. We've played a few times now, and it has worked well. It's very democratic in it's use of tecnhiques, and I can see it being helpful for fostering skills for GMing semi-live play in anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374451/#Comment_374451" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T04:26:23+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  4:26AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>A few years ago we were all hot to teach Jeepform techniques more generally, because they are awesome, and came up with the idea of a series of approachable, short, modular minigames.
