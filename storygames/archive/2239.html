                    So I started a playtest of <a href="http://wyrmwood.srgames.org/RPGs/24hour/Savagery.pdf" rel="nofollow">Savagery</a> (pdf) last night. While we only finished characters, we did have a meta-argument about the rules, which suggests that the basic idea of the game is sound.<br/><br/>So by meta-argument, I mean we had an argument about the rules as an example of the rules: <br/><br/>"Zack seems to think that he just did a feint, but I think he just did a beat. What do you think? ... I know you're going to evade, but what kind of attack is that?"<br/><br/>Realize, feint, beat, evade, and attacks in general are all descriptions of social interaction - so they refer to the conversation as it is going on. <br/><br/>And, yes, I evaded both questions, the later by pointing out that the inflection of "What do you think?" matters - a passionate inflection means a libido attack (like strike), or possibly an ideals attack (like beat), while a calmer one leans more towards a beat or maybe a feint (as a reasoned attack). <br/><br/>So far the game does everything I hoped, and perhaps a bit more. Perhaps I should do more RPG design under altered states...<br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                </div>

                            Hi Mendel,<br/>
<br/>
"Some may seem more pleasant than others, but they share a common goal, to defeat your foes in emotional combat."<br/>
<br/>
I laughed out loud when I read this! And for some reason, the movie theme to Mortal Combat started playing in my head!!! It helped that I was looking at those awesome photos you used on page 8 while reading it (bashing away &amp; dominate).<br/>
<br/>
I love the fighting styles and assist! The "should have tapped out" really spoke to me as a wrestling and MMA fan. I love the results of Ego, Empathy, Ideal, Libido, and Reason injury. From just reading and not playing, the fighting maneuvers, stats, bonuses, and damage sound all very cool. But I would need to play it out before I can get a better idea of how it all fits together. I'm also really excited about the way you use the D6 + D8 mechanic and how each individual die result has different meanings if you succeed with a specific maneuver.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever played <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://burningwheel.org/" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits</a>? Your game has certain similarities to the way BW handles social combat. It's worth checking out. Especially for different types of maneuvers like dismiss and the way it handles compromises. It's also a system that has been tested relentlessly by hundreds (maybe thousands) of people and is pretty rock solid. The Duel of Wits printouts are also worth noting as a way of streamlining the process. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/20963" rel="nofollow">Fury of Dracula</a> is another great game worth checking out for how it handles combat with cards representing different maneuvers &amp; items and how the effects mix and match.<br/>
<br/>
I was caught off guard that the roll of GM is first mentioned half way through the PDF on page 10. Till that point I had assumed there was no GM and that the players framed Trigger and Club scenes. Although I understand why in a Trigger scene, you wouldn't involve the other player controlled characters. But is the role of a GM only to deal with trigger scenes? Does the GM not have their own character for Club scenes? This becomes less confusing when I get to Playing Without a Net (page 12). It seems like you don't really want to include a GM but are including it not to scare away certain players. If you haven't, take a look at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock: Social Science Fiction</a>. I really like the way Shock handles players acting as antagonists for each other's characters. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/products.php?publisherLink=princeDarkness" rel="nofollow">Contenders</a> would also be another great game to check out.<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be helpful to include more info for Style of Play (found on page 11) earlier in the PDF since the group needs to make Style of Play choices before creating characters.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like a really interesting game. I love the concept. Thanks for the great read!<br/>
<br/>
Rock,<br/>

                            John,<br>
<br>
Thank you, I'm heartened by your enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
I'm familar with Burning Wheel, Shock, and Contenders, though I wasn't when I designed Savagery (indeed neither Shock or Contenders were published then, and Contenders didn't exist at all - since I had the ill-fortune to do my 24-hour RPG design during the grand act prior to the Ronnies.)<br>
<br>
The Duel of Wits works very well for skilled people debating in court (royal or judicial), there are different extensions to cultural and psychic conflict (with the Infection / Propoganda rules and the Psychologist rules in Burning Empires), but none of these really capture the emotional side. <br>
<br>
In a Duel of Wits, the conflict is really about whether someone is convinced - whether the people, a judge, or your own mind, but that's not how most arguments people have end. Savagery is meant to handle the brutal emotional beatings we will give each other - in the practice fight I set up for the playtesters it ended up being a dominate versus grapple blood match, with rising desperation as it became apparent that the next good blow was going to break someone. <br>
<br>
People are much more easily hurt than convinced.<br>
<br>
That being said, as far as looking at The Duel of Wits for possibilities, most of the maneuvers map thematically as much as anything else. It actually makes me curious if Entice could be a valid Duel of Wits manuever - especially in the more seductive applications. The last Duel of Wits I played might have worked out better if offering mead had been something more fitting than an Obfuscate.<br>
<br>
I'm not familar with Fury of Dracula, but given how fighting styles work, I don't think a card mechanic would help (other than index cards with each of your styles on them). The core flow is that you choose defense and lock your fighting style, then you choose your attack in ego order. Repeating each bout.<br>
<br>
As far as the player's acting as antagonists, in retrospect a modified troupe system, where each player has a foe who builds the people they encounter. The random antagonist works fairly well, but I fear it will be a bit boring after a while. I'll be putting the troupe style approach in the next version - in addition to the GMed and non-GMed versions (I generally see no problem with GMs doing less work - after all a game where the GM has equal or less to do than the players tends to be more fun for the players.)<br>
<br/>
Thank you again for reading. I hope to post summaries of later playtests, as we get to them.<br/>
