Then I quit back in 2006 for various reasons. The last game I tried before quitting was Shadow of Yesterday. It was the only RPG I had ever played aside from D&amp;D's various incarnations, and I was struck by how it looked superficially very similar to D&amp;D 3E, yet so completely different in actual play. I got on the Forge and started asking a lot of n00b questions. Good times.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago a couple of friends wanted to play an RPG, and one of them recommended TSOY. My imagination was fired, I went back to the texts (I kept them all those years), and we started playing. it led to some observations and questions I wanted to share.<br/><br/>The players:<br/>Me: My name is Ricky. I've been friends with these players for years. I've played a lot of D&amp;D over the years, a couple of sessions of TSOY, and nothing else. I'm the SG here. I fall into the role naturally; I was almost always the DM in D&amp;D games. I like TSOY because I can whip up a new character in less than 5 minutes, which means I can adapt to what happens at the table and I don't have to pre-plan everything. I specifically don't want to dedicate a huge amount of time to prep work, but then again it's 6 AM and I'm posting on an RPG forum.<br/><br/>Pat: Pat is a game designer (he's releasing a board game right now actually), so he brings a designer's perspective to the game. He had played TSOY with me back in 2006, and he's the one who recommended we play it again now. He created a goblin character, Squig, who is addicted to destroying things, and he uses Three-Corner Destruction magic to do it. He also has the Key of Destruction so when he blows things up he gets XP and refreshes his Vigor. He wants to be famous for destroying things (Key of Renown) and likes pissing people off when he does it (Key of Disrespect).<br/><br/>Geoff: Geoff is also a game designer, and Pat's business partner in their game design business. He created a character named Armitage, a Neil Gaiman-inspired elf who is on a quest to figure out the nature of the universe (Key of the Eternal Question). Specifically, he sees the world as a computer simulation, and Zu is the world's programming language. He's dedicated himself to learning more Zu words, more command words of the world computer. He also has Key of the Self, so he ignores requests for help in favor of helping himself.<br/><br/>We've played two sessions so far. We established Armitage and Squig as slaves of a Maldorian minor landowner named Alejo. I specifically had done no prep work at all, and once they had their characters created I whipped up a couple of NPCs and we set the first scene. The two slaves were at the opening ceremonies of a new library that Alejo had commissioned. Squig used his Destruction magic to start blowing it up. Well, that escalated quickly. We had a conflict where he was blowing up pieces of it, Alejo was trying to stop him and getting set on fire for his troubles, and another NPC (a soldier named Hafdan I made up on the spot) was also trying to stop Squig and Armitage interfered with Zu, by creating a wall that Hafdan ran into.<br/><br/>So yeah, we went slapstick. :-)<br/><br/>I gave Alejo the Key of Power and decided he was looking for magical power, so rather than killing his slaves for their rebellion he took them back to his house and started interviewing them about their magic. Again it went silly, with Squig insisting that he Destroys things by licking them, and ended with Squig being sent to shovel coal as a punishment for insolence, watched over by Hafdan (who now had Key of Vengeance against Squig for hurting him in their prior meeting).<br/><br/>Armitage and Alejo went to the slave market to seek Zaru slaves who might know Zu. Armitage took the opportunity to also get the word out to the Zaru underground railroad that he and Squig wanted to break free from Alejo.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Squig immediately went to lick Hafdan's face (not even to use magic against him, just to freak him out), and Hafdan, well, freaked out. Hafdan has Infantry 2 and an Imbued battelax, but it didn't help him; Squig has Destruction 2, the Massive Damage Secret and I rolled terribly. Squig inflicted harm 6 on the second round of BDTP and I conceded. Hafdan was left with an explosion-blackened face like in a cartoon, his pants around his ankles (Squig had blown up his belt buckle), and a new-found respect for Squig (buying off the Key of Vengeance in the process). We ended the session with the underground railroad breaking the two slaves out.<br/><br/>Our thoughts:<br/>We took stock after the second session, and this is what we noticed.<br/><br/>First off, this game takes some getting used to. We had to flip through all the rules frequently (fortunately I have them online which makes searches easy). That's mostly a question of experience. The second session was easier than the first, for example.<br/><br/>I also noticed that the NPCs I created didn't work too well. They were haphazard, and I wasn't invested in them. It seems I can't avoid all game prep. Prep is quick, but I do have to do it. Fortunately, the PCs fled so I can ditch those NPCs and create better ones. For instance, I spent a bit of time creating a new NPC for our third session and he sizzles. He's a ratkin wizard who specializes in telekinesis magic. I'm so excited to play him.<br/><br/>I don't like the slapstick tone we created. That mostly came from Pat's goblin blowing things up indiscriminately. It felt silly rather than arising organically from the narrative. Partly that's a question of the three of sitting down and discussing the tone we want for the game. (Nothing wrong with slapstick if that's what you feel like.) But partly I think we misunderstood the rules of goblin addiction. Every time he destroyed something, Pat would restore a Vigor point with his Secret of Addiction, but it seemed way too easy. Can someone explain the addiction rules more clearly? Is it really that easy to use?<br/><br/>We never, ever gave out Gift Dice in either session. I don't know what's up with that. Whenever I thought of using the Gift Dice, we were involved in a check where I wanted to win, so I didn't want to give them to the other guy.<br/><br/>I COMPLETELY forgot about Key Scenes and I didn't create any, for either session. I've fixed that for session 3 - my Key Scenes are that the characters meet the ratkin wizard (1 XP), they learn about the army (2 XP), and someone (anyone) gets thrown out a window or off a cliff (3 XP to the thrower and the thrown, 1 XP to everyone else in the scene). I especially like this because I'm going to announce these at the beginning of session 3 and they're going to say, "What army?" My point exactly.<br/><br/>Did I really write all that?

TSoY is one of those games where you are expected to get to know the rules well despite their mediocre complexity (as opposed to some tool-box games like 3rd edition D&amp;D, where you can ignore most of the rules most of the time and then look them up when you need them). Fortunately it's pretty logical, all told, and situational rules can be counted on the fingers of one hand.\n<blockquote>I also noticed that the NPCs I created didn't work too well.

As long as you develop interesting "stuff" (locations, people, magics, motivations), leave sufficient empty space in the scenario for the players, and do not make the mistake of pre-determining actual outcomes, the prep will probably be just fine.\n<blockquote>I don't like the slapstick tone we created.

I've found that the best way to improve on this sort of thing as the Story Guide is to take everything that happens seriously, show consequences and allow the choices the players make to stand, even when they are strange. Let the NPCs acknowledge that the PCs are asocial and strange, and let the events follow from that - this has the effect of emphasizing it even more when a single PC actually manages to befriend a NPC or find a social position for themselves, while the other player characters continue acting like looney tunes. If players complain that the game never goes anywhere except weird slapstick, then they might be ready to take on some responsibility: this type of game doesn't really have any core ethos except what the players bring to it, so if their characters don't act seriously and constructively, the SG can't make them, either.<br/><br/>You are playing the addiction rules basically correctly, I think: yes, those rules do indeed allow you to get that one Pool point per action pretty easily. The intended balance is that the SG will push back a bit by showing the consequences and addressing the difficulties of engaging the addictive lifestyle: the character with addiction does not usually act like a healthy and balanced individual, and this will have social consequences for them. Specifically: if it seems that a player is "getting away with it" and getting Pool points too easily (I don't personally think of it this way - it's trivial to get Pool anyway), that's a clear sign that the SG is trivializing the events. When the player declares that their character is going to blow up a house, the correct answer is not to go "OK" and then ignore it; likewise, when they say that they're blowing up a big rock, it's OK to tell them that you think that their character doesn't get any rush out of that anymore, now that they've done it so many times. Push back, in other words.<br/><br/>The ultimate reality about the addiction rules, as well as many other things in TSoY, is that the rule is not there to be exploited destructively: the Story Guide needs to use the character's addiction as matter of the story, and the player has to embrace that. If either the SG is unwilling to treat the character's nature seriously (by say ignoring their addiction), or the player is trying to score easy points without being interested in actually playing with the character's addiction, then the game is going to lack in content. This is not fixable by changing the addiction rules, really - it's going to be a different game if you try to fix a problem the player has (attempting to game a system trivial to be gamed) by punitive measures.<br/><br/>We never, ever gave out Gift Dice in either session. I don't know what's up with that. Whenever I thought of using the Gift Dice, we were involved in a check where I wanted to win, so I didn't want to give them to the other guy.<br/><br/>I don't usually use Gift Dice myself, either. It's a bolt-on optional rule, in truth, and I personally tend to view it as a sort of a crutch - the results can be quite impressive when the rule helps the group up their game in terms of social appreciation and audience engagement (the core purpose of the rule: quantify how players can participate even in scenes where their characters are not present), but for a group that either engages without the Gift Dice or doesn't engage despite them the rule is basically doing nothing useful.<br/><br/><br/>I COMPLETELY forgot about Key Scenes and I didn't create any, for either session.

I created a couple more NPCs and they should fit in just fine. Some of the NPCs have motivations to hate or go after the PCs, and others will want something from them. The PCs will have reasons to interact with the NPCs too; the magic-collecting elf can learn from the ratkin wizard. I haven't figured out how to hit the goblin's Keys next session, though he will learn about another way to blow things up so that might interest him.\n<blockquote><br/>Yeah, this happens all the time in TSoY, it's something in the way the game presents its rules, combined with the amount of creative authority players get.

I did keep escalating things, until eventually the stakes got bad enough that the goblin had to BDTP against Hafdan (if I recall, Hafdan rolled really well on an ability check that would have caused Harm 4, and Pat didn't like that). So it worked as expected, I think.\n<blockquote><br/>likewise, when they say that they're blowing up a big rock, it's OK to tell them that you think that their character doesn't get any rush out of that anymore, now that they've done it so many times.</blockquote>\nWell, I never thought of that. :-) I'll have to discuss it with my players and see what they think.

The whole idea of Key Scenes is that the scene itself is a reward to me, and the XP is a way to convince the players to give me that scene.

I mean, isn't it obvious that the text implicitly intends each act of "satisfying the craving" to be present in the fiction as a reasonably human-like physiological cycle? It wouldn't occur to me to interpret it as a magical ritual where pushing the button just pops out Pool points.<br/><br/>I hope you don't mind, I'll philosophize about this a bit - it's not a big deal or anything, I'm just curious about how TSoY works, it being one of my favourite roleplaying games.<br/><br/>We could talk about rules lawyering here - about whether the players are interpreting the rules in good faith, I mean, as that seems to me like a misreading in service of wrongful motivations more than an honest mistake. However, I'd like to instead quote a more recent game that has the exact same relationship between the rules mechanics and fiction as TSoY does: Apocalypse World advices us that "to do it, do it". This principle means that activating fiction-related game mechanics (Secrets in TSoY, maneuvers on AW) requires the event to actually happen in the fiction. Applying this principle, we immediately may question: did the goblin, in fact, satisfy their addictive mentality by this act of destruction yet?<br/><br/>The above sort of thinking would cause me to strongly advocate (or make a ruling, assuming the group gave me such authority) that a goblin with an appetite for destruction probably shouldn't get more than one point of Vigor per combat for destroying things in combat. The same for a goblin addicted to ice-cream cones, they should only get one point of Vigor for a given session of eating, not one per ice-cream cone. In general, it's the <i>binge</i> that matters for the addiction, not the individual actions described during it. In practice you'd only have at most one binge per scene, if that makes it easier to judge the mental realism.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the game has another implied principle: events that are shown in play should matter, and events that matter should be shown. What this generally means is that while the rules do not usually explicitly differentiate between "free" actions and other things, the general principle is that players usually cannot freely activate game mechanics during downtime by mere declaration; you need to do things during actual scenes framed by the Story Guide. I'm saying this because the next logical step for a rules-lawyer reading that rules text would surely be to declare that their character fulfills their addiction requirement "quickly, a dozen times" in between two scenes. "I stop for a minute on the way to point B to squash some bugs. I'm squashing five, so that's a full Vigor Pool for me". This is not bullshit only because of the notion that the character actually needs to have five separate binges instead of merely five separate actions, but also because the Story Guide is enabled to provide context and consequence for what happens in the game: the player needs to allow narrative space for things to happen in between those addictive binges, and in their consequence, otherwise they're not playing fairly. In other words: the SG controls narrative framing and pacing, and they do it for the sake of dramatic coordination, and this prevents players from activating their powers "trivially", without caring about fictional context.<br/><br/>I know that I advice here completely opposite to what I said above (where I encouraged you to allow the player to utilize the addiction often), but I hope you see the distinction: the goblin addiction thing is certainly supposed to be easy for players to fulfill (once a scene - sure, why not), but it's still not just a mechanical formality, it's something that really happens to the goblin mentally and physiologically - they can't just snap twigs or whatever for two seconds and be in top condition the next combat round. Therefore: by all means encourage the player to use the mechanic constantly, but also call them on frivolous application. The player should be allowed to have the power that comes from ample, unnatural Vigor, but they should also be willing to pay the price of having a lot of spotlight time shed upon their character pigging out.<br/><br/>Were I playing a goblin addicted to destruction, I'd depict my character's reaction to destruction in terms similar to pyromania or similar psychosomatic state: flushing, shallow breathing, gazing towards distance, sweating palms, generally euphoric and relaxed state post-destruction. This is obviously not something that happens in the split second between one sword-stroke and next: certainly my character will get their destruction high from a battle, but just once at the end!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/r_donato" title="r_donato"><img alt="r_donato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/539/nGJ3PVU7WMVLV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/r_donato">r_donato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412338/#Comment_412338" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-20T12:35:28+00:00" title="April 20, 2013 12:35PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your description makes <b>way </b>more sense to me. What you're describing is a discussion of granularity - at what level should the system be operating, which actions are important and which are too trivial to bother with? We ran into the exact same problem in terms of XP too. Namely if you execute a series of actions all with the same overall goal, should the Key trigger for each action or just for the overall goal? The answer is for the overall goal. That's more in line with what I was thinking.<br/><br/>It's possible that Pat was lawyering in bad faith, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. We're all new at TSOY and narrative games in general. Heck, it only takes 8 advances for a new TSOY character to transcend, so it seemed like gaining benefits quickly was encouraged. It felt kinda wrong, but I thought that was just my unfamiliarity with the system.<br/><br/>You nailed it here: <blockquote>"to do it, do it". This principle means that activating fiction-related game mechanics (Secrets in TSoY, maneuvers on AW) requires the event to actually happen in the fiction. Applying this principle, we immediately may question: did the goblin, in fact, satisfy their addictive mentality by this act of destruction yet?</blockquote>\nSimilarly, if the PC has Key of Disrespect, does he gain XP every time he tells a shopkeeper to buzz off? I suppose no, those would all be part of the same act of disrespect, each separate action being just part of a chain (assuming it was all in the same scene). However, if he also told the stranger in the corner to buzz off, that would be separate - he just disrespected a separate person, and will face separate consequences for it. Actually not even then, necessarily, because it depends on whether the stranger is a character who can actually inflict consequences. We need to clearly demarcate which actions are separate and which are part of a greater whole.<br/><br/>That leads me to wonder something. Let's go back to that example above where the PC has Key of Disrespect. He insults the shopkeeper, and the stranger in the corner. Now it suddenly matters whether that stranger is a separate significant character, or if he's just color, a shop customer, so insulting him is simply adding more insult to the shopkeeper. But I had only told the PC there was a stranger, not who the stranger was or whether he was important, and I hadn't even decided myself. A decision needs to be made, right now as XP is given out. But who makes that decision? I assume it's the SG, since the stranger is his scope. Of course, if the player insulted the stranger assuming he was just color, then he's in for a shock and may accuse me of taking a decision away from him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412339/#Comment_412339" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-20T13:16:22+00:00" title="April 20, 2013  1:16PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you've clearly got it. The granularity of all mechanical actions in TSoY is "dramatic" instead of "simulative", so there basically never are any actions that have mechanical significance but may also be spammed arbitrarily due to how quick they are to make in the fiction or whatever. Basically the principle in this type of game is always that players have great leeway in describing how their characters go about doing things, but real mechanically significant actions go along with discrete <i>choices</i>, not just any arbitrary events that might be described. For example, whether you get separate XP for disrespecting two separate people depends on whether disrespecting them both was both significant (interesting, consequential) and separate choices. I might formulate a maxim here, actually: actions without mechanical consequence are free "color" of narration, available for everybody to add, and consequently narration that <i>matters</i> should have mechanical consequences. You can't have mechanical movement that is trivialized in the fiction, nor important fiction that skips the appropriate mechanics. If you find yourself omitting mechanics or utilizing them more than the narrated story justifies, then that means that an unwanted imbalance has appeared in the landscape of the game.<br/><br/>Regarding your question, it's an interesting one because it brings up another largely implicit principle: usually when players declare action in TSoY the issue we at the table are looking at is not whether their choice is a "good" one, but rather whether the choice is interesting, true to life, dramatic, etc. What this means is that the game has no motivation whatsoever for playing "Gotcha!" with anybody - we're cooperating to come up with spontaneous art, not competing. And what <i><b>that</b></i> means is huge procedurally, for playing the game: players in a game like this do not so much declare actions for the referee to judge, but they rather suggest a preliminary course of action that is implicitly open to feedback before being finalized. In other words, it's totally kosher for the Story Guide to ask clarifying questions and give additional information if it seems that the player has potentially misunderstood the situation. This is often called the "free and clear" in procedural context, such as in the BDtP rules: players should be able to first discuss what is going to happen in the fiction, then the SG should provide mechanical judgement (which rules are invoked), and only after that the player finalizes their course of action.<br/><br/>What this process looks like in play is that if a PC with the Key of Disrespect insults a bunch of NPCs, ideally this happens because the player chose to do so and not because he e.g. was under the mistaken impression that there wouldn't be consequences. The SG might tell him something like this: "Are you sure that you want to insult a stranger you don't know? For all you know, he could be an Ammeni heir traveling incognito." If the player agrees, we've achieved more clearly drawn drama: we've learned that the character's nature is quite deliberately to insult strangers, not that the player was just pissing around. In some other games it would not be good if the GM second-guessed players like this, but in a drama-oriented game like this it's often good if you simply talk about your characters: what you the player are trying to achieve, is your character really like that, and so on. Whatever the answers, it helps everybody at the table appreciate the character as a hero or villain.<br/><br/>But that's just procedure. Regarding the concrete issue of who gets to decide what a stranger is like, that's clearly the Story Guide. What's more, he should be utilizing a principle I like to call "dramatic coordination" in making that decision: he makes the choice that facilitates confronting player characters with their thematic challenges. I often explain this by postulating a character who has gotten lost in the woods while escaping from his brother, who murdered their father. It's up to the SG to frame the next scene, so what does he do? My answer in the context of TSoY is that he either provides a lull in the action by having the PC encounter an interesting parallel setting element, or he has the brothers meet each other in the forest by chance. This is not railroading, but merely perceiving what is relevant in the fictional world, and acting upon that: we could spend the entire game with the player character being lost in the woods and not meeting anybody, but that's not how movies go, and neither does our game.<br/><br/>In summation, what I'd do as the SG in that situation would probably be to improvise a bit of nature for the suddenly appearing NPC. It's a great opportunity to bring in more setting color, after all! For example, I might ask myself: which culture of Near has not made an appearance yet? Perhaps that person is a stereotypical member of that culture! That's enough to go by for a single scene, and then I can prep something deeper for the next session or however I do my GMing. And the player would get their second XP for the insult, as they managed to make two significant insults in one scene. (Of course when the player tries for the hat trick I tell them to stop fooling around - the point of the rule is to encourage clearly-drawn and interesting behaviour, not to have your character act like they have a neurotic tick.)<br/><br/>Interesting thread, partly because this goes really, really deep into preconceptions that I wouldn't even verbalize were it not for a discussion like this. I've come to think over the last decade that roleplaying game texts can't really be "perfect" simply because what the reader assumes differs so much on the basis of experience. I mean, this stuff that I'm explaining isn't really very clearly laid out in the TSoY rules text, but I do think that it's a real part of the game - it's just so obvious for the reader with a suitable background (as well as the author, obviously).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/r_donato" title="r_donato"><img alt="r_donato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/539/nGJ3PVU7WMVLV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/r_donato">r_donato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412390/#Comment_412390" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-21T21:44:10+00:00" title="April 21, 2013  9:44PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sent this thread to Pat and we discussed it.

For me this is a necessity, I couldn't imagine e.g. tracking all Keys of all characters myself while simultaneously running NPCs and planning the next scene. This means that in practice it's on the players to declare when mechanical features of their characters are triggered, and I'll interfere if necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412413/#Comment_412413" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T08:54:33+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  8:54AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread, lots of good points here.<br/><br/>I've seen some players (and/or versions of these rules) restrict XP gain from a Key to "X times per session" (this is in some drafts of the original TSoY rules) or "once per scene" (which is a pretty good guideline for most XP rewards). <br/><br/>However, as Eero points out, this kind of restriction is not necessary so long as everyone playing is on the same page about the purpose of the XP rules: to flag significant dramatic choices made by the players. If what you just did wasn't some kind of meaningful choice or action in the story, you probably should bother taking XP for it (with the exception of some 1 XP hits, which are written so as to be things which can happen pretty matter-of-factly, and that's OK).<br/><br/>If you find Eero's explanations of TSoY play illuminating, I highly highly recommend you pick up his "Solar System" booklet, which is one of my favourite game texts and a really clear re-write of the TSoY rules (along with some fun new details like the Effects rules).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412427/#Comment_412427" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T14:46:06+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  2:46PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the trick I have used it to imagine the Goblin's addiction like a IRL addiction (cigarettes, drugs, etc.).

I 'm not sure how I would distinguish them, in fact. Ultimately, any social consequences are something that the goblin has to respond to, either accepting it or trying to overcome it. That seems like it would just be another form of conflict.
