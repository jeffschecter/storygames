One currently plays D&amp;D 3.5, the rest I believe have played D&amp;D or other games in the past, possibly 10 or more years ago.  Today I realized that one of my first indie game purchases, The Mountain Witch, is a game I've not yet tried to play precisely because I've been under the impression it would just not be that great with only 2 players.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering: has anyone played it with people who are non-gamers or gamers who haven't played RPGs in years, or whose only RPG experience has been with strictly "traditional" games?  how did it go?  any suggestions?<br/><br/>and, any general purpose suggestion for running TMW?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189413/#Comment_189413" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T12:51:20+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 12:51PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I must've played TMW with something like 50-100 non-gamers, occasional gamers or people otherwise on the gaming fringe. It's one of my favourite choices for a game to play with a group that doesn't have iron-clad preconceptions of how to go about rpgs. More problematic if your players are incorrigible (that is, unable to play otherwise) hack'n'slashers.<br/><br/>My primary suggestion is to be clear on the duties of individual players: explain carefully how players are supposed to create interesting heroes by inventing a backstory they then relate in an interesting manner as opportunity presents itself. Also explain what you as the GM are doing from moment to moment and what you as a fellow player expect next. This sort of communication is important to harmonious play - let the other players know what you expect of them, and give them feedback on how well they succeeded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189833/#Comment_189833" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T05:02:15+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  5:02AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TMW was the topic for my most recent <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a> episode, centered around a game I played in at CharCon.  Of the four players in that game, two came from a mostly traditional RPG background.  It was certainly their first time playing TMW.  The game went great.  The only hurdle the 'new' players had to overcome, which they did quickly, was the desire to have things their character did kept secret, known only to the GM, Lars, and player.  Specifically, when going through a guarded gate, the sentry demanded each character give up that which he or she most valued.  One character's sacrifice was kept secret from the other players.  This scene, which I'm sure the GM set up to provide an opportunity for players to foreshadow their character's Dark Fate, doesn't really work if everything is kept secret.  In later scenes, as the idea of foreshadowing Dark Fates became more concrete to the players, the desire for secrecy faded.  As the game progressed both of the new players wound up with some pretty cool backstories to explain their Dark Fates.     <br/>I can see the loss of a certain dynamic in a game with only two players.  In our game, although most 'intraparty' conflicts started as 1-to-1 affairs, part of the calculus for each side was to seek to enlist the aid of the remaining characters.  We had a fairly rapidly shifting network of temporary allies and foes, even as we all worked to move deeper into the Witch's lair.  These shifting alliances made the re-allocation of Trust between chapters a tense period--which was great!<br/>I'll repeat a few general points about TMW that I make in the show--recognize the connection between the strength of an opponent and the level of success necessary to defeat that opponent.  I'm sure it's crystal clear in the book, but it didn't click for me until the game at Charcon.  Second, Lars used planned scenes as vehicles for the players to foreshadow character's Dark Fates.  So there was a lot in each scene that even he didn't know, but he had some planned questions to ask; things like, 'the creature falls dead, what happens to the corpse?'  "It changes shape into a man." "Who is the man?"  etc., more or less the process named 'The Mountain Witch trick'. <br/>Anyway, I hope you play and let us know how it goes!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
