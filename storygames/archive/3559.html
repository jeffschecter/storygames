If that's "not optional" then I'm not playing.  Which is, of course, bollocks - of course it's optional.  But just like everything else in the book, you might not get the same play experience if you ignore it.  Personally, I'm happy with that: If the game doesn't work without the funny handshake, then the game doesn't work.<br/><br/>(I think there's an issue of the subtle and often unspoken English taboo on funny handshakes, but that might just be me)<br/><br/>I think that there's a thing with game authors wanting to dictate exactly how a game is played.  Like that whole fiasco with Jared Sorensen saying that character gender was restricted to player gender in Decay.  Everyone's like "yeah, whatever, I'll just play the game the way I want..."  Which is a reasonable reaction, but the point is the author is actually saying "This is really how I'd like you to play this game".  I just think that this is an unfortunate choice of phrasing which, frankly, rather pissed me off and apparently had the same reaction from you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80153/#Comment_80153" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T02:14:17+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  2:14AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If they were that integral and important, the text wouldn't need to remind you to do them.</blockquote>\nThe whole purpose of the text is to remind you to do them.

I felt a very strong resistance to this, but did it anyway. I grudgingly had to admit to myself it worked, and had a positive effect on the game - now that we'd done that, it was easier to do other trust-requiring things in the game.<br/><br/>However, the <i>phrasing</i> of such rules - and all rules - is extremely important. Use of suggestive communication is often very effective. Magnus Jaboksson's "Until we Sink" is the best example of this I've ever seen. The rules hardly ever say "do this! and you have to do this!" - it's always "It might be a good idea to...", "a good way to do this would be..." etc. You don't build up resistance to the text, because it doesn't push you - there's nothing to actually resist.<br/><br/>Magnus Jakobsson.

After all, we don't read "roll a d20 and add your attack bonus" and say "well, that's just a suggestion". What makes that more important then saluting before the game begins?  Just because a rule speaks to the social side of a game instead of the mechanical side does not mean it should be seen as optional or a suggestion (any more then any other rule at least).<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80159/#Comment_80159" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T04:59:09+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  4:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not a case of "more important" really, more a case of "what I'm willing to be told by a game text".<br/><br/>A game's text consists of rules and instructions.

When we play, we tend to put all the cards where everyone can get them and let everyone take their own cards.  That works just fine for us.

The members of your Crew must:<br/>-\tBe Polish.  Your characters may be devout Catholics, or Jews, or even ethnic German Communists, but they will be Polish.<br/>-\tBe 15, 16, or 17 years old.  Any older, and they're in the Home Army.  Any younger, and nobody is going to put a gun in their hands (with tragic and notable exceptions; see <i>Varsovian</i>, sidebar Page 27).    <br/>-\tBe members of the Grey Ranks.  Perhaps imperfect or reluctant members, but members nonetheless.<br/>-\tWant affection.  Love and romance can't be avoided, nor should they.  <br/>-\tBe capable of hate.  This really shouldn't be a problem.  Even if you can't envision it as play begins, enough bad things will happen that by mid-game, hate will probably seem perfectly natural.<br/><br/>Perhaps you'll read these rules and get excited about playing an emotionally dead 13-year-old Azeri Muslim orphan.  Recognize that the narrow focus of this game is intended to expand, rather than constrain, the possibilities in play.  Commonality is more important than uniqueness at first - differentiation will occur as the game progresses.  Work within these parameters and you'll have a more successful game."<br/><br/>Rich, does that piss you off?  I tried to word it in a positive way, but it really is a "you must" paragraph.<br/><br/>I wrote the game around these assumptions.  If you ignore them you aren't just playing the game in a way that wasn't intended (which is obviously fine), but you're playing a game that won't make any sense.  It'll be busted, because everything is tuned toward those core parameters.  Christian and Lisa have a social, kinesthetic core assumption.  I have yet to play Beast Hunters but I'm willing to bet they wouldn't say "you must do this" unless not doing it really changes the experience in a negative way.  Or conversely, doing the funny handshake probably makes it loads better - probably because you're making physical contact and entering a ritual space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80163/#Comment_80163" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T05:30:43+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  5:30AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My play experience does not/will not involve doing a funny handshake.

That I have no interest in doing, and therefore will not do.  That are not something <b>I consider</b> to be part of what I do.<br/><br/>Your example is interesting because Grey Ranks is, to be completely honest, not a game I have any interest in playing whatsoever.  Because of the subject matter, which is utterly bleak, depressing and unpleasant (as well as being historical, which is another turn off for me).  I can remember you talking about an AP you had at Dreamation where you said something along the lines of "It was awesome: My character proposed to the girl he loved who doesn't love him back, and it was made even more awesome because he'd pissed his pants at a German army checkpoint!  AWESOME!"  And I'm like, "Hmm, that's not really my idea of awesome, but it sounds like you had a great time, which <i>is</i> awesome."  Like when someone tells you how much they like Manchester United: they're not <i>wrong</i>, it's just not my thing.<br/><br/>Your text there isn't telling me anything I don't already know about your game: You're saying "You are a child soldier in the grey ranks" Which is pretty much what the game is about.  That's also not telling me to do anything outside of what I want to do (other than that I don't actually want to play a child soldier in occupied Poland in the first place, but you see what I mean).<br/><br/>Does any of that make any sense?<br/><br/>Put it another way, if Grey Ranks had a line that said something like "whenever something bad happens to your character, get one of the other players to kick you in the nuts.  That way you'll really understand how your character feels.  This is important and not optional" I'd feel that it was hella optional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80168/#Comment_80168" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T05:47:16+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  5:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, sounds you know an objectionable "you must" statement in a body of rules when you see it.

The Salute is an instruction.  By not doing it, I am not exactly re-creating the play experience that Christian and Lisa are aiming for.  Either the game can survive that and still be fun, or it can't.  But there are two possible outcomes from this:<br/><br/>1) Rich plays the game without any funny handshake shenanigans.<br/><br/>2) Rich does something else.  (Grooms the cat, plays GTA, tidies the spare room, etc etc)<br/><br/>If 2) is more rewarding than 1) then I won't play the game again.<br/><br/>I don't play D&amp;D either, D&amp;D has a lot of things innate to it's mechanics which I dislike.  Like Classes and random character generation.  I'll probably never play another RPG which has random character generation, because I don't like it.  If I play D&amp;D ever, it'll have to have some kind of point buy system.  I'll probably never play an RPG that involves handshakes or whatever.

What I meant to say was, why don't you feel like the salute is not a rule? It serves a purpose other then being a funny handshake. It defines when we are playing the game and when we aren't, and it acts as a kind of solid reminder of the social contract between the two players.

Fair enough.</blockquote>\nYeah, it's difficult to come up with a definition of what's acceptable and what's not.  The more I think about it, the more I'm coming to the conclusion that whenever you come up with a mechanic or instruction which is outside the norm, you run the risk that someone (in this case, me) will say "No thanks, that's not what it's all about".  For example, a lot of gamers consider character stance immersion to be pretty much the be all and end all of roleplaying.  For them, any system or mechanic which forces them out of that state is completely unacceptable.  Another school of thought give the GM absolute authority over everything and will not, under any circumstances, entertain the idea that the GM is not the final word of law.  For them, the idea that a player might be able to exert any authority over the game world that the GM cannot veto is unacceptable, and so they have no interest in playing games where that is possible (or when they do, they drift them or ignore rules so that it's not).<br/><br/>For me, restrictions on what character I can play are mostly fine, they're usually pretty much the point of the game.  Like you can't play a Samurai in Agon or a Greek warrior in The Mountain Witch.  No sweat.  When the Aliens RPG (all those years ago) lacked rules for creating anything except Colonial Marine characters, that was pants because that wasn't how the game was advertised.  (That was also very far from the only problem with that game though)<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, I think that it's reasonable for a game to tell me to:<br/><br/>Roll dice<br/>Add up numbers<br/>Draw cards<br/>Write things down<br/>Assign points to things<br/>Move counters around<br/>Speak<br/><br/>There are other things I'm sure I've overlooked, but you get the gist of what I mean.  Anything outside of that list is novel and will be considered on it's own merits.  So Dread's Jenga mechanics are taken on their merits and would probably be OK.  Graham's joke game about punching people wouldn't be OK.  I also wouldn't be up for a game where the player's physical skill made any difference to the outcome of anything.  So, while I like playing Jungle Speed, I don't really get invested in it like I need to to make an RPG work (because I don't really care if I win at Jungle Speed, I'm just there for the chaos).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80177/#Comment_80177" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T06:58:27+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  6:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2007 7:00AM by Graham.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, my original point was slightly different (although don't stop discussing Rich's points, because they're interesting).<br/><br/>Game texts never say "Roll d6 for damage.

If you leave out the salute then you're not really playing Beast Hunters. A part of the game's spirit and intention is gone. Christian and Lisa tell us to do the salute because they know that it is something that is outside the scope of the gaming experience that most of their target audience is familiar with. They know that it is important to the game, but they also know that we might write it off and not do it anyway. So they tell us to do it.<br/><br/>If Beast Hunters were targeted at non gamers as an entry level game then telling the player "Shake hands before the game. This is not optional!" would not be necessary. The players would read all the instructions and assume that they were all to be followed. Shaking hands would carry as much weight as rolling dice. The rest of us? We're so conditioned by playing the same game (in various forms) over and over again that anything that isn't ...<br/><br/>"Roll dice<br/>Add up numbers<br/>Draw cards<br/>Write things down<br/>Assign points to things<br/>Move counters around<br/>Speak"<br/><br/>...seems like it's out of place and can be ignored. We need to get over our conditioning.<br/><br/>But that's just Beast Hunters. There are other games that do exactly what you describe. My own game, Sea Dracula, is full of "this is not optional" statements. None of them are true. lazy game design? likely.<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80186/#Comment_80186" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T07:24:37+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  7:24AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, the game makes it pretty clear exactly why the rule is there.

Except I wouldn't be able to see the rulebook or all those "And so it came to pass" sentences you're supposed to start every scene with.<br/><br/>I've owned Polaris for a couple of years now and never really felt the urge to play it.  Maybe it's the ritualised nature of the game that puts me off, I haven't really thought about it before.  But it's not really a game which has ever made me want to play it.  Thinking about it, Polaris seems (to me) to be mostly ritualised storytelling.

I'd played the game before . The rest of the house hadn't. We got into it and discovered that about half of us were really into using the dice mechanic to do what Dogs does, and the other half of us didn't want to use the dice at all. They wanted to put "all those complicated rules" aside and just roleplay in the setting. The game broke up. A few months later at Gencon I mention this to Vince. He says "What's the point then? If you aren't using the games rules then why are you even playing?" Which was pretty much how I felt.<br/><br/>Back to the topic:<br/><br/>That's not to say that you can't toss aside a rule that you don't think works or that you think you don't need. Play the game how you want. But when we write these things w put the rules in for a reason. It's worth considering that these rules serve a purpose and are meant to be part of the game. By leaving out rules you lose th authors intent, and you may not be getting the game game experience that the  author wanted you to get. yeah, I understand that you may not want that experience anyway, but you may be missing something you didn't know was worthwhile because you left out a rule you thought was silly. In the case of Beast Hunters the salute really isn't a pointless ritual (in my opinion) but a tool to simulate the culture of the tribes and the honor of the warriors. It's as valuable to the game as the dice rolling and leaving it out does the game a disservice.<br/><br/>But maybe that's just how I work? I find more and more that if I play a game someone else wrote (as opposed to just free form roleplay or playing something I wrote) I'm doing so because I'm interested in that authors ideas and I want to see what the game can do. What kind of experience it creates. That's what interests me. I guess it's always going to be different for different people though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80200/#Comment_80200" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T08:27:35+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  8:27AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>It's worth considering that these rules serve a purpose and are meant to be part of the game.

One doesn't need to emphasize "roll d6 for damage" because it's a type of rule that's expected.  Conversely, one might need to emphasize "shake hands before the game" because many people might not recognize it as a rule at all, and people (or at least Americans) kind of bristle when they're told to perform acts they associate with socialization or atmosphere, rather than acts they associate with games.

Let me quickly go through them.<br/><br/>For one, it's an "unrule" action, as Robin Laws calls it. Gamers are used to treating mechanical rules as somewhat set in stone, at least for the first couple of sessions until they almost inevitably start houseruling and converting stuff. They don't feel the same way about "rituals" or other parts of the rules that are not as familiar. Hence, a reminder that this isn't just a gimmick, but an actual rule. I felt like I needed to make something explicit that, otherwise, would be viewed through the lens of already established practices.<br/><br/>Second, yes, I think it adds something important to the experience. The reasons, as was mentioned, are outlined in the text. You may think the salute is one of the minor rules in the game. I think it's one of the major ones. Like Jake indicated, it establishes a certain line of communication as well as style of play. Everything else in the game follows from communication and play style. If your group already has those firmly, explicitly established, then this rule becomes much less important. Most groups that I've been in didn't. <br/><br/>Third, most indie games aim to be Narrativist, while this one's a profoundly Gamist design. That means the explicit establishing of play styles is not only aimed at traditional gamers, but also at indie gamers who are used to Narrativist games. They need to know what to expect and what not to expect.<br/><br/>Fourth, one of the reasons it says that in there is because <i>I myself</i> sometimes forgot it in the heat of playtesting or demoing. When I ran the game at the first Go Play PDX at Jake's house, for example, I totally didn't do it. (And the game still was great fun! In part that's because I as the designer instinctively communicate and run the game according to its playstyle.)  So this is a way of making sure people think about it and keep it in their minds. Because it's the game opener, it's not like a rule you can just look up during the game, like most others. By putting in a strong statement, at least you're going to think and talk about it and therefore not overlook it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>That all said: you can certainly have fun with the game without it. Plenty of people do. And I'm not going to say you're doing anything wrong. If you end up not liking your play experience, however, I'm going to look for that as one of the things that could have gone wrong, exactly because of what I said in above about establishing communication, shared play style, and expectations.<br/><br/>I also totally support people altering the game to fit their own needs. On RPG.net, The Eye has already changed the Strike rule to make it more deadly. More power to him. Shawn is converting it to a pirate setting and changing all kinds of rules, and I hope it works out and he enjoys it. I just won't be able to guarantee that all the parts work together like they do now.<br/><br/>And that's all there is to it, really. I hope you enjoy the game, and feel free to do with it whatever you want, armed with the knowledge of why we created it the way we did. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Oh, and I'm definitely interested in more comments--and Rich, if you find the time to voice your other issues somewhere, I'd be happy to talk about those too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80296/#Comment_80296" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T14:59:20+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  2:59PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2007 2:59PM by MikeRM.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, would a good alternative phrasing be: "This is an important rule, and if you omit it, you may not get the experience we intend.

There are lots of rules, rituals and procedures in every game and some are more necessary than others. If you drop some the game won't work _at all_ while dropping others may have no discernable effect to some players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only speak for my own book (Best Friends) on this topic. I have a rule in there that says "pass extra hatreds to the right" and you need to have some rule there to make sure the permissions are passed around evenly. I chose "to the right" and so that's the rule. If everyone passes the extra ones to the left that works too (as long as you all follow that). If you don't follow that rule it won't work. [OK, you could get lucky in passing them around randomly if you all get even but that's accident not design.]<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile another bit of character creation says "Now draw your character in the circle-triangle style" and if you do that then it's goofy and fun and I think it does add to the game. However, I didn't feel any need to say "this is integral and important to the game" because it's not. It's only integral and important to the game experience if you want it to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I have flagged up that one is vital and one isn't? My thoughts were that you would either follow them all as written, or work out which ones you wanted to use for yourself. I'm not sure how much control my words have over your play experience anyway!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80315/#Comment_80315" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T16:39:37+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  4:39PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>That all said: you can certainly have fun with the game without it.
