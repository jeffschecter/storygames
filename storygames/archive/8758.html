Essentially, it is a game where players play kids that play with dolls to enact incidents of being molested, a technique used by therapists to get kids to "open up." <br/>It is easier to show where the doll was touched essentially. The game will be called something like "1:6 Scale Molestation".<br/><br/>But I realised that it is all about the dolls and how the dolls feel about being molested by the kids on a daily basis. And so it turns into a game where you want to remove dolls from play to save them. And doll-doll interaction, kid-kid interaction, and presumably kid-doll, which is interesting. <br/><br/>The game will be a combined miniature game and role-playing game, that's what I think right now anyways. For the RPG part, character creation will happen as a process of assembling a doll from doll parts. Doll parts all come from old broken dolls, and so each have a history. So \u2013 back-story will be built into the doll you make. Red yarn for blood and white yarn for the other thing. <br/><br/>Inspired by Clyde L Roher's recent ashcan game (name eludes me at the moment), the kids will not be allowed to speak, only through the dolls. Presumably, the dollhouse will be alive at night, to let the dolls react to what the kids just did to them. Taking a doll out of play will be a metaphor for taking a kid away from an abusive situation. But there are leaking metaphors in my design and decisions to make to fix that. <br/><br/>For the miniature game, I suspect there will be miniatures (kids) playing with smaller miniatures (dolls), which is going to be interesting. It will also be interesting to come up with rules (or absence thereof) to facilitate jeep-style play in the miniature setting. I really have no idea. I also get off on the idea of floor plans with living rooms and back yards, or even the dark alley. This can be used in both games. (The minis part is vague. I'm not a miniature gamer and will have to consult the the two jeepers who are. Sorry to disappoint.)<br/><br/>The game can always be made less scary by being played in a WHFRP setting, but what's the point? Oh, and red yarn for blood and white yarn for the other thing. I don't have my notes with me right now. <br/><br/>I am swamped by two deadlines at the moment, so progress on this game will be slow for the next month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194870/#Comment_194870" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T10:51:25+00:00" title="February 28, 2009 10:51AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>I demand to know more about this "jeepform miniatures" business.</blockquote>\nTobias is making it up as he goes..

Ridiculous. And I'm not shitting you. <br/><br/>About 6\u20137 years ago, at Halmicon in Halmstad, Sweden, we tried to unify diplomacy, jeepforming and miniature gaming into a single game. It turned out pretty well. It was called "N\xe4r pesten kom till byn", which is roughly "When the plague hit our village" and was a Swedish spin on Dawn of the Dead. The old story of a zombie disease spread through biting and the world being overcome with zombies and states and infrastructure shutting down. <br/>The players played 14 or so different people from a village (Hylte bruk) that decided to seal itself off from the world. <br/><br/>Parts of the game was played as a diplomacy game on a huge map that two of us had made (Wilhelm and Lina Bj\xf6rkman) where different fractions were fighting for control over the village. (As far as I can remember the army reserves people, the mayor and his staff and some people led by a mushroom scientist\u2026) There were issues of placement of armed guards, etc. and we used the outcome of the diplomacy scenes as input to what would happen in the jeepform scenes, which were actual quarrels between the fractions, some love story in the middle of it all, the mayors son returning home finding the place locked down and the political ramifications of letting him in, etc. Finally, zombie onslaught was played out on a diorama where zombies would advance and had to be fought by the players' characters who were represented on the board. Kind of like the old Aliens board game, but with freeform movement. Stuff from that feedbacked into the diplomacy and jeepform scenes. Olle Jonsson made the miniatures game. Per Wetterstrand, Anders Nygren, Fredrik Axelzon and I wrote the characters and background stories etc. <br/><br/>I think the miniatures part was the least appreciated one, because it just slowed everything else down and forced people out of character to roll dice and the like. You know, the bad stuff. In any case, it was a fun thing to do. The most amazing thing was that the eight people involved in making all parts of this game just made it all happen without any coordination from anyone.  <br/><br/>No, actually, the most amazing thing that happened was that the school in which this game took place was full of, wait for it\u2026 model houses built by the school kids in exactly the scale Olle had used to build our models. So we could borrow another 10+ houses for the diorama. That was a crazy coincidence. <br/><br/>Another guy that did a lot of semi-similar things in Sweden in the 90's was Axel Haig (then Axel H\xe4gg), who made super cool dioramas for a world called The Land of Blood. Players played one miniature each that also had a character and we alternated between role-playing and miniature gaming. He wrote his own music for these games and generally did a crap-ton of work. This sounds very much like old-styld D&amp;D when I write it out, and it may come close, except for the acting-out parts when you played your character. Axel liked drinking whisky while playing and leaping across tables and getting physical with players. Those were the days. I think he designs church windows now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194897/#Comment_194897" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T19:29:30+00:00" title="February 28, 2009  7:29PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Playing with D&amp;D miniatures is too easy\u2014they're already cast. Sewing a doll OTOH\u2026 <br/><br/>We're now talking about a design where doll-parts actually will have to be sewn together with thick yarn or something to reify the process of creating the character. A bit like painting your molested monsters I presume.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
