Other games that can do it are Breaking the Ice, Under the Bed, 1001 Nights, It Was a Mutual Decision, Shock: (though only just), Bacchanal, Geiger Counter, Contenders, Engle Matrix games, It's Complicated, Primitive, Urchin and probably a bunch that I've ignored for some reason. In fact, I have so many of games for these performance parameters that nowadays I'm looking for games that not only perform, but also do something better than the median of that bunch.<br/><br/>More of an issue with rpgs, at least for me, is that I need time to focus and orient myself to the idea of playing something. I'd just much prefer hanging out to playing something if I don't have a plan of some sort for play. Luckily I've gotten pretty good at both dodging play (I just throw a <i>Zombie Cinema</i> box at the teenagers and run if I don't feel like playing with them) and having ideas prepared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219039/#Comment_219039" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T11:41:52+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 11:41AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>In fact, I have so many of games for these performance parameters that nowadays I'm looking for games that not only perform, but also do something better than the median of that bunch.</blockquote>\nOf those, I am familiar enough to speak of <i>Breaking the Ice</i>, <i>Shock:</i>, and <i>Bacchanal</i>. Of which, the only one that might meet what I'm looking for is <i>Bacchanal</i>. We opened <i>Pandemic</i>, interacted with each other non-stop (including going over the rules and setting up the board), and then played less than thirty minutes later. No one off in the corner alone studying the rules. No one doing any kind of lonely prep.<br/><br/>That's what I'm looking for. <br/><br/>Yes, <i>Breaking the Ice</i> and <i>Shock:</i> are within my acceptable length for rules (a length that gets shorter and shorter as time goes on), but they are still long enough that I'm not going to open the book for the first time with my partner next to me and thirty minutes later we'll be up and running, both of us familiar with the rules. Which is why they sit on my shelf for a fair bit of time between purchase and play (or did, I don't do that any longer).<br/><br/>Games that have done this for me include: <i>Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</i>, <i>Shadows</i>, and <i>Microcosm</i>.<br/><br/>I suspect that a commercial game that might do this for me is: <i>Sweet Agatha</i> (but that's just a guess). If there's others, I would like to know about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219042/#Comment_219042" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T11:45:21+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 11:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of group-specific factors, of course, but you can add <i>Montsegur 1244</i> to the list of possibilities.

I don't have to play them while reading them for the first time [EDIT: But a game designed to be read together as a group as you begin the game would probably accomplish exactly what I'd like], I mean, we weren't reading the rules to <i>Pandemic</i> while we played. But the time between open the game for the first time and play: should not be spent alone (as in, no one off reading by themselves or if they do, it's gotta be brief (unless everyone is reading alone), because otherwise the other players will get bored and they'll start up a game of something else instead) and shouldn't take more than half an hour.<br/><br/>Actually, this just made me think of something, we didn't totally grasp the rules by the time we started playing. We went back to them more than once for clarification as to what we should do in certain situations because we couldn't remember the details. That was totally cool by us, we were happy to do that. And I would be happy to refer to the rules during play in other games as well (heck, I do it every time I post when playing KKKKK).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219167/#Comment_219167" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T15:45:46+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  3:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The physical objects that make up Pandemic lend themselves to ease of learning and use.

Not in such a way that the text would be part of the game fiction (which is what PFYT does), but reading the rules aloud is part of setup.

Wouldn't neccesarily require game specific objects, but I think they help, as they won't be associated to other games (as the mentioned deck of cards might).<br><br>What I mean there is that when learning/explaining the game, you can easily go 'These cards mean this, you draw one when this happens, these tokens represent this, this token represents you, each circle on the board does this...'<br>Now while you could introduce masses of boards and tokens and cards to an RPG (and I would like to try a game like that, if not neccesarily <i>buy </i>one), I think you could approximate the effect by representing all of the rules distinctly on the character sheet. So if there's something you can do once a game, put a clearly defined checkbox on the sheet. If there's a roll you can make, put the target or method or whatever on the sheet, even if it's a fixed number, and either associate it with similar rolls, or if there are no similar rolls give it it's own section.<br>If there's a GM, you could even consider giving them a GM sheet, or at least a one page summary.<br/>At that point, you can look at the sheet and 'see' what you can do, and hopefully remember it better as it is lots of small bits of information tied to specific things.<br/><br/>Make sense?

Character descriptions that rely on lots of interaction with the rules, ie. abilities with numbers tied to them.<br/>So much of the bulk of bulky RPGs are taken up with what amounts to a geography text for an imaginary world, or with ways to describe the character in the players head in terms of the rules of the game.<br/><i>Pandemic</i> and <i>Penny for my Thoughts</i> get around this by assuming<br/>1. Our world<br/>2. by limiting the points of contact between the character descriptions and the rules. <i>Pandemic</i> characters have 1 ability. <i>Penny</i> characters have zero.<br/><br/><i>3:16</i> doesn't assume our world, but also doesn't rely on a detailed, pre-fabricated world for atmosphere. It relies on a brief description of history and the creative energies of the GM to bring the worlds to life to the extent that they are needed. It also simplifies character creation by limiting the points at which the character interacts with the rules (2 abilities, 2 weapons). Players fill in the gaps with their characterizations without needing to write down a lot to remember what the character is like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219995/#Comment_219995" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T20:03:41+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  8:03PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Hi again, sorry for the overly brief comments - I was posting from my iPhone.</blockquote>\nThanks, I was wondering, I mean, who doesn't shill when invited to?
