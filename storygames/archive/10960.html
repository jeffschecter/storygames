I don't know if I can fix the page count. Including 10 pages blank for artwork, the character generation chapter is like 62 pages long. And to me that feels like bare bones, really bare bones.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been a while since I played the full-fat game but I'm playing it again this Saturday. Having left it so long, it took me a bit of concentration to get back on top of all the rules and the plot of the game I'm running (that's 800-odd pages in 9-point font in the full-fat game - maybe half a million words), but I think I'm there now. We're looking at some pretty big battles, some very high-powered player characters with maybe some more basic allies taking on large numbers of enemies. There might be 50, even 100 involved in a single battle so it could momentarily look like a war-game. I started this campaign to see what full-fat Omnifray was like at the highest levels of complexity and it seems to run fine, but then again, that's with me in the driving seat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm wanting the successor game to be far more accessible. It'll never be Risus, it'll never be in remotely the same ballpark as Risus, but that's not the point. It's hard to articulate what the point is, but like an elephant, I know it when I see it. I think what I'm about is proving (to myself first, then to those who care to be convinced) that you can have a roleplaying experience which painlessly combines almost perfect quasi-realism, game-balance and meta-mechanics across a vast plethora of play-styles without buggering up your speed of play. How do I get that across without sounding as if I'm trying to say "a better roleplaying game", a claim that no-one will take at face value?

If the answer is "not much," it doesn't matter if it's 20 pages or 200.  If the answer is "quite a bit," then 200 pages is no object.  But the bar for this one is very high: I have about six shelf-feet of GURPS, and several FUDGE and FATE books, and Basic Roleplaying, and even Savage Worlds.<br/><br/>The question for me as a player of games: what kind of investment will it take to get started, and is that more than my fellow-players will put up with?  This is the main reason I'm not playing Burning Wheel, despite its elegance: one of my usual players will not put in the effort it would take her to learn the rules, which means she will be a major drag on the game; and as she suffers from GSF#5, if I don't invite her to a game, even one she won't enjoy, I'm an ostracizer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293098/#Comment_293098" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T13:39:23+00:00" title="September 12, 2010  1:39PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Off topic, but have you considered confronting her about it? I can put up with a lot, but not knowing anything else it sounds like she's terrorising the game group by controlling what gets played and what doesn't get played.<br/><br/>On topic, I agree that there's always the question of what does this game do that I can't already do, and is one of the main reasons that most of my ideas for games haven't got very far. At some point I discover some game that has already done it, often better, so what's the point? That's also a point in favour of open license games, and I wouldn't mind seeing an open license percentile system. So many systems make use of it, it'd be nice if there was some standardisation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
