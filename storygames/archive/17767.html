It is about what happens to a relationship when broken tools are all you have to work with. You will need:<br/><br/><a href="http://wearelostinplay.com/?attachment_id=402" rel="nofollow">The Rules</a><br/><a href="http://wearelostinplay.com/?attachment_id=401" rel="nofollow">Kim's Playsheet</a><br/><a href="http://wearelostinplay.com/?attachment_id=400" rel="nofollow">Marshall's Playsheet</a><br/><a href="http://wearelostinplay.com/?attachment_id=399" rel="nofollow">Pressure's Playsheet</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/KimCROPsmall_zps00d550c3.jpeg"/><br/><br/>It's a game for 3-4 players. One player will play Marshall, one will play Kim, and one or two players will play the Pressure, setting scenes and complicating the lives of K&amp;M.<br/><br/>It's a game that lasts one session. Every time I've played it has lasted between 2.5-3.5 hours, and produced satisfying and sometimes emotionally troubling play. It has a clear procedure for how the game ends, as well.<br/><br/>It's a game that is pretty light-weight, and designed to learn as you go, reading from the text together at the table. Here's a little bit more about how the different player roles work:<br/><br/>-Marshall's player has powers to change what other people at the table say.<br/>-Kim's player has powers to force Marshall, the character, to do things in the fiction.<br/>-The Pressure players have power to force Kim &amp; Marshall into difficult situations.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/eminemCROPsmall_zpsa447f164.jpeg"/><br/><br/><b>If you would like to playtest my game</b>, I\u2019d love it and be super grateful! It\u2019s worked every time I\u2019ve played this version, so far, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of satisfaction out of it already.<br/><br/>If you do play it, please get in touch with me afterward and let me know how it goes. Talking about it anywhere in public, online, is totally cool, too (even if you didn\u2019t like it).<br/><br/>If you want to record it and send me the audio or put it up somewhere, that would be amazingly appreciated and you\u2019ll get SPECIAL RECOGNITION in the notes when I publish this game.<br/><br/><b>Here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know, once you have played it:</b><br/><br/><i><br/>1. Who ended the game? Why did they decide to end it?<br/>2. What direction was the relationship between K&amp;M going in at the end of the game? How did it (or did it at all) change during play?<br/>3. How many Persona Tokens did Marshall usually have, at any given point? Did he ever hit the limit of 10?<br/>4. How many Break tokens were earned and Break scenes used?<br/>5. Were there any specific points of confusion as you were reading the text?<br/>6. Any other comments are appreciated.<br/></i><br/><br/>The materials for the game are strictly functional, nothing pretty. Just so you know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402446/#Comment_402446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T00:19:33+00:00" title="January  2, 2013 12:19AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2013 12:27AM by Hans_c-o.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a bite-sized bit of AP, to give you a sense of how it might play at your table:<br/><br/><i>We had a chilling scene where Kim and a friend were discussing her relationship over coffee. The Pressure at play in the scene was \u201cinfamy\u201d. The friend was concerned for Kim's safety, as she'd seen so much bad press about Marshall\u2014how he was violent, a drug addict, etc. Kim said things were fine, but eventually let slip that Marshall had hit her, once. Immediately Marshall's player (not in the scene), spent a resource and forced her to say something different. What came out was a defense of Marshall. Confession erased.</i><br/><br/>Sometimes we have scenes like this, and they affect the dynamic between the players at the table: we know that Kim was silenced here, and the rules say that when Marshall spends that resource she must remain silenced. However, she has her own ways of getting Marshall to do what she wants. What happens from here, and where does it all end? That's why we play.<br/><br/>I'm happy to answer any questions. If it's just crickets, that's cool too. If you stop by because you're intrigued but then leave, I'd love to know why--I'm trying to finish my first game and I'm doing it with a really weird concept, so any of the thoughts in your brain about this are valued by me. <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=70.0" rel="nofollow">I discuss my playtests of the game in more depth over here</a>.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402488/#Comment_402488" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T11:13:46+00:00" title="January  2, 2013 11:13AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, Hans, I'll bite.

I picked Eminem because he\u2019s a strange, interesting figure, and I\u2019ve listened to his music a lot throughout my life\u2014maybe I\u2019m exorcising a demon here. I think he evokes an immediate reaction in people--which in my circles is usually the crinkling of the nose. He\u2019s super popular in general but hated by a lot of intelligent liberals, he\u2019s got skill at what he does in spades, but his music is often problematic as hell. He also occupies a uniquely weird position in hip-hop that brings up all sorts of stuff about how race works in this country if you think about the \u201cphenomenon\u201d of Eminem even a little bit.<br/><br/>A big part of it is that I simply thought "Eminem RPG" in my head and laughed. It's so ridiculous that I had to follow the thought. I figured most everyone else would also do a double take at the sheer weirdness of the concept, and that Eminem would be immediately recognizable as someone you have some sort of opinion about.<br/><br/>I wrote this game in the mindset someone might have when they write an analytical paper on Eminem. Not to say I\u2019m all smart, just to say that I was looking at his music and pulling apart the assumptions and perspectives and using the game to say something about that.<br/><br/>Really, it\u2019s about the specific sub-set of Eminem\u2019s music that deals with his fucked-up relationship with Kim.<br/><br/>This is all, of course, intensely interesting to me. I figured it would be for others, as well. This is the test!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402528/#Comment_402528" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T17:23:11+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  5:23PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting.

It was really sad, &amp; a bit scary - like being in a room with someone who might become violent at any moment, and you know that no one would believe you that they did so. <br/><br/>There were some really sweet times, too, though; when Marshall and his daughter (a child in our story) connected. <br/><br/>There were funny moments, but those also had the underlying danger of being upset at any moment. <br/><br/>I liked playing with the mythology that real-world Marshall made about his &amp; Kim's life. It made me uncomfortable (not in a way i shied away from) a bit, thinking about how, regardless as to what Eminem says in his music, there's no way to know how kind or desperate the relationship between Kim &amp; Marshall really was.

The first time I played as Kim. The way the mechanics work, like in the example Hans mentioned, have a lot of bleed. Playing as Kim you really feel the power Marshall has over you. You'll say something as Kim and Marshall's player will correct you. When the thing that gets silenced is a mentioned of Marshall's abuse, you can't help but feel a little of what it's like to be a silenced housewife. The fact that his character's hold over you doesn't require his direct interaction in the scene makes it feel even closer to that parallel, Marshall's voice is always in your head, telling you what to do.<br/><br/>The next time I played I thought I might be able to get out of the hotseat by playing Pressure, but I ironically felt a lot more creative pressure in that role. You've got to set every scene and populate the world with characters on the fly, much like a GM. Luckily the play aids in the game give you exactly what you need when you look down. Throw together any combination of choices from the three lists of seeds and you'll have a great framework for a scene. Then it's like you've got your hand on the temperature knob for a pressure cooker holding Kim and Marshall's relationship, slowly turning up the heat . <br/><br/>To me the game isn't specifically about Eminem. He's a great subject because he talks about himself with seems like great candor in his lyrics, creating a rich persona when mixed with his coverage in the media and the autobiographical film about him, but it's impossible to know how much of the persona he projects is real without knowing him personally. He provides a good canvas for the themes the game is looking at. But really the game is about the pressures of being famous as an entertainer in America, with your flaws thrust out in the media spotlight, and then seeing how that falls on your personal relationships. It examines the duality of having a public and personal persona and seeing what happens when one bleeds over into the other.<br/><br/>In Eminem's own words, <br/>"I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to see <br/>Marshall no more they want Shady I'm chopped liver ...<br/>But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me<br/>So this must mean I'm disgusting, but its just me I'm just obscene<br/>Though I'm not the first king of controversy<br/>I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley, to do Black Music so selfishly<br/>and use it to get myself wealthy"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning" title="Orion Canning"><img alt="Orion Canning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/n90YJAPJ48BYJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning">Orion Canning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403090/#Comment_403090" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T17:01:53+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  5:01PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See also <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/singforthemoment.html" rel="nofollow">the lyrics to Sing For The Moment</a> to better understand why Eminem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403125/#Comment_403125" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T22:03:23+00:00" title="January  8, 2013 10:03PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2013 10:03PM by Hans_c-o.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments, guys!

I'd be happy to play such hacks. For Hans-as-human-trying-to-express-something-through-game-design, though, it's gotta be Eminem or there's no point. I don't know if I can express why better than I already have in this thread (or through the game), but I'm willing to try if you want to know more.<br/><br/>I'm perfectly willing to acknowledge (and have been all through my process) that this is something of extremely niche interest even within an extremely niche corner of an extremely niche hobby! I still think it's got a worthwhile experience to impart, though, and if it ends up being simply a curiosity that folks raise an eyebrow over and move past, I'll chalk it up as game design experience and move on myself.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403167/#Comment_403167" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T08:51:50+00:00" title="January  9, 2013  8:51AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's totally cool.
