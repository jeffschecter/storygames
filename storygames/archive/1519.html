                    Hi.<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem. I have a problem with the way how some people (not all people, of course) from the Forge-O-Sphere explain RPG theory. I will try to explain why.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's say Alice is a known Forgite and explains what she has learned to Bob. She starts with GNS.<br/>
<br/>
Alice: You see, different people enjoy different things in RPGs.<br/>
Bob nods. He probably met lots of gamers with different tastes.<br/>
Alice: There are three agendas in gaming. {Short description of GNS.}<br/>
<br/>
Now, three things might happen. If Bob was outright dumb, he would say: "Yes." If Bob was clever and a bit rude, he would start to call Alice's so called "theory" bullshit. For the sake of this discussion let's assume that Bob is both clever and a very cooperative listener. Then he might say:<br/>
<br/>
Bob: Wait. What kind of sentence was this 'There are three agendas.' ?<br/>
A: It's part of the theory.<br/>
B: No, no. I mean, that's is a definition, isn't it?<br/>
A: Hmmm.<br/>
B: I could say there are two agendas. - Gamism and Rest-ism. Or I could say there are 37.<br/>
A: Well, probably.<br/>
B: Then you should say so. Otherwise people might think, you're stating a fact or make a conclusion from the things you've said before.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think, it's clear what I want to say. There are many Alices out there, so this particular problem occurs regularly. Not only with GNS but with many of parts of the Forge terminology. BTW, as soon as everyone has realized that G, N and S do not really exist, all this bickering would suddenly cease, since it's all arbitrary. But I want to talk about teaching the modell, not the content itself.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore our cooperative Bob might also advice Alice to explain who formulated each part of the theory first. (Bob is very interested, too.) He might also ask, if there are alternative approaches to RPG theory, and I would hope that Alice at least knows some, although it is of course her prerogative not to use them.                </div>

                            Stefan,<br><br>I'd go you one further and suggest that a subset of the Alices out there are particularly dogmatic about the Big Model, so that they look at all gaming through its lens.  Furthermore, they tend to read any question as a mere misunderstanding or ignorance of Big Model tenants.  For a particularly current example, see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1494" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a> in which JBR raises the legitimate question of whether Bangs can exist without Force, a receives for his trouble an ongoing reiteration of "Bangs are this, and Illusionism is that."  The sister thread at the Forge would be worse if Ron weren't politely asking people to be quiet.<br><br>Ideally, we should be aware of the school of thought from which we personally argue, and that it's only one of many.  Ideally, we should be familiar with other schools of thought.  I think the trouble is that there is a segment of our larger community that imagines that the Big Model is the final word on understanding role-playing games.  The unfortunate result are these repeated entry-level explanations of basic concepts in response to higher level questions that only serve to muddle the conversation.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah. I think GNS is a huge waste of time as a theory and of modest success as a manifesto, but what the hell does my opinion matter? Either the audience is receptive or they're not. They may have good reasons not to be receptive (thought about it and rejected it, like me, he said virtuously) or they may not (heard some guy snigger about it in a thread a while back) but you should always say what you believe, either way.                        </div>

<p>Exactly. (Although Alice is Stefan's PC, not mine.) Personally, I consider it a problem for the whole hobby that someone who stumbled across theory online (and was more interested in it than in immersing themselves in forums and communities for a year) would likely be Alice when he or she was done reading what articles he or she could find which claim to explain the theory. But I didn't start the thread and I'll shut up.</p>

                            First, Stefan, I think I get your gist, but what did you mean by "I mean, that's is a definition, isn't it?" is that a typo? I couldn't make sense of it.<br>
<br>
Second, it sems where "Alice" went wrong is in capitulating to this point:<br>
<br>
"B: I could say there are two agendas. - Gamism and Rest-ism. Or I could say there are 37.<br>
A: Well, probably."<br>
<br>
It seems to me that Alice should have said, "Well, purely hypothetically, that could be. But what the theorists have found is that these three agendas map well to observed actual play, and people have been hard pressed to identify any others."<br>
<br>
I also think she should have said "there have been three agindas IDENTIFIED in gaming."<br>
<br>
I also think she should have said "CREATIVE agenda." Or maybe "Point of play."<br>
<br>
See, I agree--a bit--that she's explaining things poorly, but I don't agree with your assessment in the OP, Stefan, because while it looks like you're critiquing her *approach*, I think what's really happening is, you're saying "I don't agree with the theory and I'm going to try to nudge all the Alices into compromising their position to the point where they're not talking as if the theory was true." Kind of cuts Alice's position out from under her.<br>
<br>
This is supported by your comment, "as soon as everyone has realized that G, N and S do not really exist," which rather pegs that you don't buy it. Which is, y'know, fine; believe that and say it. But there's no use disguising it as a critique of *presentation* by theorists, and no use complaining when the theorists believe and say what *they* do. It's like, "I've got a problem with the presentation of the Mormon missionaries that visit my house. They always act as if they believe it's true." Of COURSE they do!<br>
<br/>
On the topic of alternative approaches to theory, does anyone *know* of any, besides theRpgsite, whose "approach" is basically "All games are the way I do them, ever. You lose"? I'm genuinely curious.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I take umbrage with your phrasing here.  A school of RPG theory has found that, but the same school ignores and doubts the existence of immersive play - which other schools of theory fixate on, almost to the exclusion of other goals.  What suggested by your phrasing, is that there is only one school of thought in RPG theory, and that simply isn't true.  Not only are there off-shoots (and predecessors) to Forge theory, which introduce variances, there are whole other foundations of RPG thought, which we've had the privilege to be exposed to through Jukka, and Tomas, and the other Scandinavian role-players who swing by.

Only if Alice's position is dogmatic.  Like it or not, any statement that begins "According to the Big Model..." and is as true as it is an accurate description of that body of theory.  But to say that Big Model theory is absolute truth is a pretty significant error.  And one which a lot of forum dwellers are victim to.                        </div>

                            First, I take a moment for an extremely bad Harry Potter Joke: &gt;ahem&lt; Take my Umbrage. . .please!<br/>
<br/>
*rimshot*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
"A school of RPG theory has found that, but the same school ignores and doubts the existence of immersive play"<br/>
<br/>
It does? Huh. News to me. Way I understand it, immersive play is one of the elements of the Big Model (falls under Ephemera, I'd say), and if it happens to be the actual POINT of play, I'd say it's one brand of Simulationism. So the Big Model accounts for immersion. May be right, may be wrong, but it's not "missing" a chunk of roleplaying experience as you seem to suggest.<br/>
<br/>
"What suggested by your phrasing, is that there is only one school of thought in RPG theory, and that simply isn't true."<br/>
<br/>
See, I thought, *naturally* we're talking about the school of thought "Alice" ascribes to. What other school of thought would she be talking about? Would it be better if she prefaced her remark with, "Well, according to the Big Model. . ."? Somehow I expect that'd be seen as invoking the Model as authority and using it as a bludgeon. So what's Alice to do?<br/>
<br/>
"But to say that Big Model theory is absolute truth is a pretty significant error."<br/>
<br/>
I get the feeling I'd better tread carefully here. One misstep and you'll be construing ME as the one saying "The Bib Model is absolute truth." Which I'm not saying. But I do ascribe to it. I've looked under the hood and kicked the tires and it makes sense to me. It's improved my roleplaying experience. So here I am, making statements that are grounded in the Big Model. My statements are thus far confined to the Forge and Story Games. I haven't made any forays into RPGnet to Preach the True Way to the unbelievers. But even if I did, what should I do? My fingers (I only use four of 'em, poor dears) are gonna get pretty tired typing "At least according to the Big Model theory pioneered by Ron Edwards and others which may or may not be true" at the end of every sentence. I believe it's true. So I'm gonna speak as if it is. If someone wants to *debate* a point about the theory, by all means. But what I'm seeing here is more like "Ya lousy Mormons get offa my lawn!" rather than "You know, I was reading Doctrine and Covenants and this thing didn't make sense to me. . ."<br/>

                            The most common ways I have seen the theory badly explained probably fall into these three camps:<br/><br/>1.  Someone balks and suggests that their play preference is not captured or not captured adequately, the point is discussed and it becomes clear that they are unpersuaded, Alice assumes they do not understand and flogs the dead horse for a ton of posts rather than moving on.  That alienates people, sometimes people understand but do not agree.  It's fine to think they're wrong, but assumptions that they simply don't follow the argument do more to alienate than persuade.  Sometimes it's better to let it rest and agree to disagree.<br/><br/>2.  Alice informs the person that clearly they do not understand their own play preferences.  I've seen this a lot, and unsurprisingly it rarely improves communication.<br/><br/>3.  Alice refers the person to a wodge of background reading that would take days to wade through.  If you're struggling to succinctly summarise, bail and let someone else have a go.  Asking people to do homework rarely persuades.  A succinct summary suffices, if the person wishes to know more that's the time to show them all the other resources out there.  As an initial explanation though it's lackwitted to point someone to three essays and a hundred Forge threads, that is step two or three.  Step one is a succinct summary.<br/><br/>So basically, if you avoid treating people like idiots or like they're deluded when they disagree you will run into fewer problems.  Most of the anti-GNS reactions comes down to one of those first two things, patronising communications.  The third is more likely to make people lose interest than anything else.<br/><br/>Oh, and 4, if someone comes in gunning hard for GNS it's best to politely say it's worked for you and disengage than to get into a fight, as the fight will polarise positions and you'll often find yourself inadvertently getting backed into 1 or 2.<br/><br/>And that's about it.  No magic, just don't talk down to people or oversell.  I have seen a few other appalling errors, but those were individuals rather than a general problem.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>On the topic of alternative approaches to theory, does anyone *know* of any, besides theRpgsite, whose "approach" is basically "All games are the way I do them, ever. You lose"? I'm genuinely curious.</blockquote>
There's GDS most obviously, there are several others too but I don't keep track as it is a topic of limited interest to me.  Leaving aside RPGPundit (and I would note that many posters on the rpgsite don't agree with his analysis in the slightest) as he doesn't really have a theory there are I think three or four fairly well developed theories.<br/><br/>GDS and GNS I think are about equally useful and equally flawed, but I don't think this is the thread for that debate nor is it a debate that greatly interests me to be honest, but GNS is not alone out there.  That said, GNS is the currently most discussed theory, in part because of the Forge of course.<br/><br/>Edit:  John Kim's site as ever has good resources on the theories out there at <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/</a> </div>

The problem is other elements in the dialog (whatever it is in a potential Alice's head that has led her in the past to tell people they are in denial or do not understand the way they themselves play, for example).<br/><br/>These are either assumptions <i>behind</i> some of the theory (i.e. "traditional play is dysfunctional") or agendas <i>that involve</i> the theory ("I don't like space opera games") and the question of how the theory intersects with these ("I can use the body of theory to lend credibility to my bashing popular games.")<br/><br/>There are things that could be done about that--but it would have to start with a meta-analysis of the dialog as a whole rather than an examination of the individual bits of the theory.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            One other thing to note, when you find yourself debating GNS stuff with someone who hates it, remember they are not your target.  They are unlikely to be persuaded, if they feel that strongly the odds are they are already pretty familiar with it.<br/><br/>Your target, if you wish to bother at all, is the lurkers.  Lots of folk read these debates, how they judge the theory may well come down to how the proponent of the theory acts, unfair as that might be.  Indulge in the pleasure of flaming someone who richly deserves it and you turn off those lurkers, respond reasonably and politely and they may be inclined to look further into what you are saying.                        </div>

Uh ... yeah.  WORD.<br/><br/>Not only do I not feel obliged to correct the zealous ... I no longer even feel obliged to point out that the zealous do not speak for me.  I'm sick of rising to that tired old rhetorical bait.
<blockquote>Some random wanker:  "Tony!  You support Forge Theory, and Ron Edwards said that people are brain-damaged!  Your whole argument is flawed!"<br/>Tony:  *Yawn*  "So, anyway, what I was saying is that linking mechanics to player actions draws attention, table-wide, to those actions.  By choosing which acts to draw attention to and which ones not to you foster a specific lens through which play is seen ...."<br/>SRW:  "BRAIN-DAMAGE!"<br/>Tony: "... and that mindset, in turn, encourages behavior.  So 'reward mechanic' is a double-whammy ... even a mechanic with no relevance to play empowerment will draw attention and action, by its very existence."</blockquote>
I also agree with Balbinus on the lurker question.  Internet posting isn't for the combatants, it's for the spectators.  It's emotionally hard, but very useful, to remember that and be deliberate about it.  When somebody says something <b>really, really stupid</b>, if you can (and it's hard!) just let that stand as the final word on the subject.  I mean, really ... can you make a better argument for your point than to have your opponent make a complete ass of himself?                        </div>

                            Another way I feel that people can sometimes poorly communicate their ideas about RPG theory is dogmatism. Most folk, when they design RPG rules, are thrilled if gamers lift the parts of the rules system they really enjoy and junk the parts they aren't very thrilled about. I have, however, occasionally noticed GNS advocates insisting that people have to accept the <i>entirity</i> of GNS theory, and that if people adopt the parts which they find useful and scrap the assumptions which don't work for them they are <i>wrong</i> and are misusing the theory.<br/><br/>Taking Immersionism as an example, supposing Gary, a GNS advocate, was talking to Ingrid, who believes strongly that immersion exists:<br/><br/>Gary: "...so the GNS model says that those three agendas are the ones which have been best identified through the examples of play we've collected on the Forge."<br/><br/>Ingrid: "Hey, that's really interesting! I've noticed that when I'm playing my immersion can get wrecked if there are too many Narrativist or Gamist techniques at work, since I don't like to be reminded that I'm playing a game and I don't enjoy stepping back-and-forth between OOC Narrativist considerations and my character's IC mindset..."<br/><br/>Gary: "Woah, hold up, immersionism doesn't exist."<br/><br/>Ingrid: "What do you mean it doesn't exist? My whole group gets into it all the time!"<br/><br/>Gary: "I'm sure that seems like the case, but there's no place for immersionism in GNS theory."<br/><br/>Ingrid: "No place? But it's already helped me work out what parts of games hurt my immersion!"<br/><br/>Gary: "No, it hasn't, and you're misapplying it if you try to apply it to immersionism."<br/><br/>Ingrid: "Oh, well in that case maybe it isn't as interesting as I thought it was..."<br/><br/>See, Ingrid was about to partially adopt aspects of GNS, but Gary's dogmatic insistence that you can't dilute it or cherry-pick the segments that work for you ruins everything.                        </div>

                            My solution to explanations of theory is to say, "Don't talk to me about theory.  Tell me what happened at the table."  My experience of theory is that it often operates as the opposite of pragmatic application.  So I run away from pure-theory chat as much as I possibly can.  It's too much like listening to religion.                        </div>

<p>GNS is a perfectly functional theory and I've never seen one that both draws from actual play and functions as well as a tool for matching player desires to game play. (The hole in my understanding being about Sim, but as far as I can tell, I don't care about it, so it doesn't matter to me.)</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/index.php/2006/09/15/guess-whos-coming-to-donner/" rel="nofollow">a little article</a> about it a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>It's a theory: a description of observed processes that, when a phenomenon is reproduced from that description, produces a similar process. It doesn't explain everything in the world. It describes three mutually exclusive things that players might want from a given game.</p>
<p>It is not hard to understand and it is hard to effectively refute. That makes it a solid theory. That there are other, competing theories does <em>not</em> make in an unsolid theory. That egos are tied into both its propagation and its denial does not address its quality as a theory.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Oh. Immersionism. No one says it doesn't exist. It's just not a Creative Agenda. It can support any of the CAs. It's a Technique.</p>

So here I am, making statements that are grounded in the Big Model. My statements are thus far confined to the Forge and Story Games. I haven't made any forays into RPGnet to Preach the True Way to the unbelievers. But even if I did, what should I do? My fingers (I only use four of 'em, poor dears) are gonna get pretty tired typing "At least according to the Big Model theory pioneered by Ron Edwards and others which may or may not be true" at the end of every sentence. I believe it's true. So I'm gonna speak as if it is. If someone wants to *debate* a point about the theory, by all means. But what I'm seeing here is more like "Ya lousy Mormons get offa my lawn!" rather than "You know, I was reading Doctrine and Covenants and this thing didn't make sense to me. . ."<br/></blockquote>
I'm glad the Big Model works for you.  I'm fascinated by your input on any and all theory discussions.  But you gotta understand, at least Story Games is not the Tabernacle.  It's more like the Convocation of Spiritual Search: a Non-Denominational Think Tank.<br/><br/>So, if someone comes to you and asks about the Big Model, please by all means elaborate on your understanding thereof.  Then chapter and verse has to be the basis of discourse.  But when we're talking about general role-playing theory, it's not the only way to think.  Shoehorning stuff into the Big Model doesn't help people who don't buy into the Big Model.                        </div>

                            Thanks, guys, for the links. I've heard of SOME stuff, like GDS, but I'm still pretty green. Just a guy who wandered into the Forge a year ago following a random Google trail.<br/>
<br/>
Balbinus, your problem communications list is great, especially #3.<br/>
<br/>
Judson, I think you're setting up kind of a false dichotomy here: it's not so clear-cut as "theory discussions" vs. "non-theory discussions." It's just discussions. No, you can't operate here under the same assumption as at the Forge, that everyone knows the theory and is mostly on board with it. But I still go back to this: If I believe something is true, I'm gonna talk as if it was true. I've long ago made the shift to operating as if there were a "In my opinion," or "my belief is" clause in front of everything I say. If I actually SAY "In my opinion" or something, it probably means that it's just a gut feeling not based on anything, OR I'm uncertain for some reason and don't want to give a false impression of confidence or certitude.<br/>
<br/>
The Theory applies to discussions of RPGs. Period. Whether it's right or true or not. That's not shoehorning. That's just discussing things from a certain perspective, which everyone does.<br/>
<br/>
So all my comments on every discussion everywhere are gonna be grounded in my discussion of the theory. As Fred said, "pure theory" discussions make him run for the hills; applying a standard of "keep it in the theory discussions!" just ghettoizes a whole group of people's opinions. I personally try to keep as much jargon out of my posts as possible and state things in a natural, real-people way (my model is Vincent Baker). But it's still all grounded in theory.<br/>
<br/>
I think I've said about all I can on this thread. It's dangerous to continue with this hypothetical Alice-disscussion because she's not real, so the what-ifs can continue indefinitely ("what if she says illusionism doesn't exist?" "what if she says he's playing wrong?" "What if she takes his lollipop and pushes him down and laughs?"). I agree that there are bad proponents of theory and bad ways to discuss it (hell, I turned off my brother, maybe forever, to the theory in my early eagerness and poor understanding of it). But my contention from the beginning is that in this thread, the problem was misdiagnosed.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Sorry Joshua, but this is a great example of where it goes wrong.<br/><br/>Nobody in this thread said it didn't exist or that anyone had claimed it didn't exist, what people were talking about were dismissive summations of other people's experience and how that impedes communication.<br/><br/>As part of that, you've chimed in to say without argument that those who argue it's a CA are wrong.  I'm not sure what that has to do with this thread, but it is a pretty good example of the kind of statement that derails theory threads.                        </div>

Actually, yes, I was.  If I've misread, I apologize, Joel.  Let me address the rest of this to Joel, and let him respond:<br/><br/>What I took from your post was what I saw as a false dichotomy: that either Big Model stuff isn't welcome at all ("fuckin' Mormons...") or all theory discussion has to be Big Model discussion.  I see neither path as useful, and want to suggest that there's a third way or accepting that the Big Model is <em>a</em> theory amongst many, some formalized and some not.  Bring it to the party and we'll have a grand time.<br/><br/>Like I said, maybe I totally misread, but I got that dichotomy out of two separate posts in this thread.<br/><br/>Edit: Crossposted with Joel.  And yes, apparently I did read in a dichotomy where none was intended.  I'm still not sure that we agree, but I don't see there being a real issue there.                        </div>

By contrast, I think this is a powerful and effective way of explaining theory.  Edit:  I wrote that badly, what I mean is that Melinglor's approach is a powerful and effective way of explaining theory.  Draw on it but stick to natural language as much as possible when discussing with non-theoryheads.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>But my contention from the beginning is that in this thread, the problem was misdiagnosed.</blockquote>
I think the OP is a bit of a strawman, given the OP assumes the theory is wrong.  I don't think that's a helpful assumption for a discussion of this kind.<br/><br/>By the way, GDS sucks for summating the nar CA, I would argue that GNS sucks equally for sim and that GDS gets that much closer.  You pay your money and take your choice, which one is most useful to you may depend on which one best captures your particular play interests.                        </div>

                            Judson, cool. I see where we were talking past each other now. I can see where you'd get that, thinking back to an earlier post. I think communication's getting garbled because our hypothetical bob 'n Alice could be engaged in a Big Model discussion, or talkin' about something else and she just brought it up, or whatever. We don't know.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, a quibble with my own language: My comment in my last thread should read "So all my comments on every discussion everywhere are gonna be grounded in my UNDERSTANDING of the theory." Just sayin'.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Balbinus. My first foray into all this was Vincent's Roleplaying Theory, Hardcore. I didn't understand it at the time, but after finding the Forge and going around and around with the essays, the forums, and emails to Ron, I finally came back to the Hardcore, read it again, and went "Oh!"<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I think it's a pretty good approach.<br/>
<br/>
"I think the OP is a bit of a strawman, given the OP assumes the theory is wrong."<br/>
<br/>
Yes, exactly. It conflates "They shouldn't keep discussing the theory in bad or unclear ways" with "They shouldn't keep saying their wrong theory is right."<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm gonna go check out that Dogmatism thread of Tony's now. Cheers, all!<br/>

Peace,<br/>

                            The main issue that always comes up in these discussions is one of dogma. Look, scientific theories--and RPG theory falls into the social science realm--are <i>not a religion</i>. Saying "I believe in GNS" is as misguided as saying "I believe in Diffusion of Innovations Theory".  What you believe in is the utility of that theory in analyzing a topic at hand.  That is, I'm not spreading the Dogma of GNS because it's the One True Faith (and I'm branded a heretic in that regard, anyway); I'm showing people how using the analytical framework of the Big Model can help me understand certain dynamics that occur when people get together to roleplay.  Other dynamics I've found to be better understood using other theoretical frameworks.<br/><br/>So any theoretical framework can only be "true" in the Pragmatic sense (see William James) to the degree that Truth means utility for understanding and predicting phenomena.<br/><br/>Can we have a discussion about gaming without theory?  Sure, if we're just going to look at specific events without establishing any patterns, categories, or conclusions. But those are mere anecdotes that won't help us understand or improve play and design.                        </div>

                            Just to illustrate  the difficulty in trying to make the separation in this way:<br/>"I'm not spreading the dogma of christianity because it's the one true way. I'm just showing people how Jesus can help them."<br/><br/>I mean, I dig your point, but I think you're assuming people are misusing the term dogma when, in fact, they are (sometimes) accurately using it to reflect a genuine sense that certain tenets of theory are not up for debate.  In fact, I think you'll find both sides of any theory debate in fierce agreement that theory should not be treated as dogma. The point of contention will be that one side of the other is doing so despite their claims to the contrary.  Part of the nature of dogma, after all, is that it is rarely apparent as such to those who follow it.<br/><br/>Cynical as that sounds, I entirely agree that these theories _should_ be treated in a fashion closer to how they are in science and social science (though lord knows, that would hardly be less contentious). But they're not, and damned if I know what's going to change that.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

Jonathan, I wonder what a theory would need to qualify as existing?  There's lots of them out there.  What makes them not really competing theories?                        </div>

</div></blockquote>
<p>I've never seen any evidence that it's a CA. It's not like everything that's cool is a CA. It's not like the CAs are particularly cool.</p>
<p>Every time I've asked a self-identified Immersionist (probably 1/2 of my games go to Scandinavia, so there's a good amount of communication with folks of that school of though) what they like about immersing in character, what they've said has assumed that there's something they like about the character and their struggle, and that they're taking a direct hand in the process the character goes through to â€” get this â€” <em>address theme</em>.</p>
<p>My point is that the theory is <em>extremely sound</em> and actually encompasses a good many things without passing judgement on them.</p>
<p>The fact that I don't care for Simulationism has nothing to do with its value as a mode of play. The fact that I experience Immersion in games and enjoy it, but don't consider it a central technique doesn't address its power as a technique. The fact that I like Narrativist play and only rarely dig a Gamist RPG doesn't address the qualities of those Agendas at all.</p>
<p>Immersion is <em>a method of playing</em> in order to experience something. That makes it a technique that a good many people have found useful, powerful, engaging, and fun. CAs are just a different kind of thing. It's like trying to get oxygen classified as a metal.</p>
<p>But the identity politics that people get tied up in, holy shit.</p>
<p>That's what this is really about.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as a Gamist, Simulationist, or Narrativist. They're not types of people.</p>
<p>"Forgies" aren't a type of people, either. The Forge is a forum where people have been gathering for six years to rigorously devise a theory that predicts player behavior and is used to build games that can reliably give desirable results.</p>
<p>Here's the theories of the Forge, in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's something you want from play.</li>
<li>If you use a system that gives you that, you will get what you want.</li>
<li>If someone's not happy with play, it's probably because the system isn't giving them what they need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else is details.</p>
<p>I bet everyone here agrees on these things. I'm not willing to say otherwise because someone thinks Ron's a poopiehead.</p>

                            I agree with JD (no great surprise, I guess). The Big Model says a bunch of other things like THIS will interfere with THAT kind of fun, and THIS is so different from THAT that it's like [some really, really incredibly different thing]. And, of course, the idea that THISism and THATisms are just shorthand for "kinda prefers THIS or THAT" gets thrown under the bus when it's convienent.<br/><br/>I *don't* disagree with the three quoted specifics--but I get those from GDS as well as The Forge (regardless of whether GDS speicifically describes GM intentions or not, it shows how people want things, different things, and how system might not give them to you). <br/><br/>And for what it's worth, "system" in that list <i>might</i> mean the most common use of the term ('game system,' i.e. "which game are you playing?") but <i>probably</i> means "how everyone makes decisions at the table" which means those three things are probably <i>only</i> read correctly by people here (as a given group) and <i>maybe</i> not even everyone here (if someone came from a differnt background and somehow got in despite the self-selecting nature of the place.<br/><br/>If all of this sounds negative, it isn't--the idea that people here, on The Forge, and in theory in general are saying somthing worth listening to is very, very true. The idea that it's just "that simple" (so that no one who's thought about it could really disagree with it) isn't doing the conversation justice, IMO.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

I was going to let this whole thing go, except you're attributing statements to me that I never said.

And without disputing that, my point is that no single theory can address the universe of possible role-playing.  It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godels_Incompleteness_Theorem" rel="nofollow">mathematical impossibility.</a>  With that in mind, we should recognize that it's legitimate to pursue other theoretical models, schools of thought, etc.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't know that we entirely disagree.                        </div>

                            Thanks for clarifying Joshua.<br/><br/>Nothing to do with you, but I'm slightly losing the will to live on this topic, that genuinely has nothing to do with your posts, it's just that discussing how to better communicate the theory only has so much value to me and I think I've said everything that has the slightest chance of being useful that I have to say on the topic.  I only have so much energy to post on what is a fundamentally negative topic (by which I mean shitty posting habits, not the theory or anything like that).<br/><br/>I'm off to look for a thread about happy stuff.                        </div>

I'm not disputing that.  And I think here's the happy ending (at least for me): that, yes, the Big Model is useful, and good, and the games that have been developed with the Big Model in mind are also good.  We agree on that.  What I'm trying to say is (abuses of mathematical logic aside) that the Big Model isn't the universe of useful theory, and it's a mistake to treat it as the One True Way.  Feel free to adhere to it, just recognize that it's one book in a library that we're just beginning to explore.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite><br/>Jonathan, I wonder what a theory would need to qualify as existing?  There's lots of them out there.  What makes them not really competing theories?</blockquote>
Wow, this thread couldn't end fast enough... To answer Joshua BR real quick:<br/><br/>I don't think people are presenting ideas about roleplaying that are mutually incompatible.  Maybe this comes from my background in aesthetics. You have some aesthetic theories that claim that beauty can be found in the physical properties of objects, in the way colors and shapes interact in complex ways, for instance. There are other aesthetic theories that say we value art for reasons that are primarily social, because they are produced by specific people through specific practices and are experience under specific circumstances. Both of these (and these are only two examples) are really important because they reflect the way real people feel about art. People look at something and go, "Wow, the combination of colors in that piece is just amazing!" but then some people may look at the same work and say "Ugh, some dude just threw random paint blotches on a scrap of cardboard; if that wasn't hanging on the wall of the museum, nobody would know that it's art!" While these views may seem incompatible, they are both true, but they are both merely perspectives for examining this diverse, crazy thing that is art.  Same with roleplaying.  We are blind men examining an elephant. It feels pretty different when you're standing in different places, but it's the same elephant.<br/><br/>P.S. Yes, a liberal arts education and living abroad has made me a relativist.                        </div>
