However, the Mystic style card has a power listed that simply says "Ritual Magic: Should do something cool." So... I was wondering if anyone has had any ideas on this front. I've been thinking of maybe allowing the Mystic to cast a ritual during a scene by checking off any number of their [+]s, and anyone in the next scene that does something empowered by the ritual can spend from those [+]s to add <i>hits</i> to a roll instead of bonus dice.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any other ideas that we might try out?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264297/#Comment_264297" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T21:36:53+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  9:36PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Summon the ghost of earth's long lost second moon.<br/><br/>Call upon the powers of Satan.<br/><br/>Travel to the dreamworld in order to confer with the King of Cats.<br/><br/>Call upon the ghosts of Doc Brass, The Shadow and G-8 and other dead earth pulp heroes.<br/><br/>+'s?

I'm happy to have people summon ghosts, call on Satan, travel through dimensions and whatever else, but you don't think there should be some sort of rule explaining how those things help with whatever the Danger Patrol's current situation is? I'm not trying to give you a hard time, it's just that all of the rest of the roles and styles have a clear mechanical effect in addition to the rad narrative effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264361/#Comment_264361" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T10:33:30+00:00" title="March 29, 2010 10:33AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used mystic ritual to close a dimensional rift.

So it's providing an expansion of what a character is normally capable of by saying that most characters can't do big flashy rituals to affect threats and change the stuff that is happening in a scene because it doesn't fit with them thematically (so they have to describe it in a different way, if they want to close a dimensional rift, for example). But you can do magic, assuming you are willing to sacrifice the time necessary to do so, and thus have more freedom with how you explain your approach.<br/><br/>That seems interesting, if unlike the other Style powers. I definitely don't want to lean on hard mechanical effects as a crutch, but recent experience with D&amp;D 4e (for example) has me seek out mechanical effects as a representation of what happens at the fictional level. And since the game seems to involve a lot of tactical usage of dice and powers, it seemed like it would be appropriate to have something more similar to the mechanics from other powers. But this kind of thing works... it reminds me of some of the Secrets from the Solar System, which don't really provide bonus dice or new effects but rather expand the purview of a particular ability (e.g. "You can use your Artist ability to cause harm in physical conflicts" or "You can use your Knife Fighting ability instead of your Cooking ability to make conflict rolls").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264397/#Comment_264397" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T13:46:15+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  1:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd and Storn are playing it very right.<br/><br/>For the record, though, that power reads that way because I am lazy and haven't written anything for it.

Gives more player input. One of the saving graces. It might be a good idea to examine something flexible but of specific scope. Perhaps the ritual should be tied to their second keyword--a mystic commando might summon a squad of soldiers from history, while a mystic detective unveils truth and lies for a turn. They still have to sue these elements, but it gives them that trait (or effect) comparable to other traits character types have.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan there be a Mystic Explorer?

Also, it allows the ritual itself to take any form that is appropiate to the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, its only really useful against a high level Threat where there are also other Threats on the table, otherwise its likely to be destroyed anyway before your next turn comes around, so all you've really gotten is +1 hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a ritual just lets you ignore a Threat's ability, like you can hit something that is staged behind another Threat, or your attack is not reduced by its resistance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418825/#Comment_418825" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T15:13:01+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  3:13PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I resurrect this thread?

I'm still getting the hang of this game's mechanics, but something like: "RITUAL MAGIC: Treat your ritual as a major threat that can only be faced with mystical powers.
