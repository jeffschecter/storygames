The idea is to interview gamers/designers/publishers/podcasters/people in the gaming community, about:<br/><br/>-their history<br/>-their experiences<br/>-how their personal history intersects with gaming history<br/>-what games mean to them<br/>etc.<br/><br/>The idea is very broad right now, though if it happens the project will most likely focus on roleplaying. If I do this, the idea is to put up audio files and maybe also transcribe the interviews.<br/><br/>Are you interested in such a show? Are you <i>not</i> interested in such a show? Why or why not? Who'd you like to hear on it? Is there a project/show out there that I don't know about that already gives this to us?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343233/#Comment_343233" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T07:39:44+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  7:39AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am interested both as a potential listener/viewer and a potential (gamer) interviewee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343242/#Comment_343242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T08:33:28+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  8:33AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I am interested in your ideas and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.</p>\n<p>Oral history is important for any kind of folk history, and I think we're getting to the point where we can have that for this community.

It may start there. And those <i>are</i> easy conversations to have, but, for example, how many times have you heard Jonathan Walton on a show? I think maybe once, or maybe not at all, and it seems that his personal history intersects with gaming history as a whole in a lot of interesting ways. There're a lot of untapped experiences around here.<br/><br/>All of that to say, though: yeah, the wider the scope, the better. The project will start humble and seek to grow, because that's the only way I can do it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>If possible, try not to<a href="http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2010/08/30/show060-interview-with-david-wesely/" rel="nofollow">record episodes on a train</a>.</blockquote>\nI think this is my favorite thing I've ever heard on a gaming podcast. I listened to it twice when it came out, and I should probably listen to it again. Does anyone have any idea how to get in touch with David Wesely?

By "history" I just mean "people do things, time passes, we look back on it and call it history." I mean personal history, history as story.

I'd love it if someone went over and talked to those cah-razy Scandinavians and then editted it into a one hour show. I just need the highlights. Like when the entire gaming community was nominated for Diana Jones in 2004? I was not there for that and I want someone to give me the skinny after having discussed it with many people and pouring journalism sauce all over it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
