I think it's fair to say we played a game about a woman in an abusive relationship fighting against a corrupt and oppressive society to save life of her child.  Also, a game about callous gods (spirits?) and their callous worshippers.

So that makes twists happen several times.  Also, there's enough unpredictability that you can't count on even a disadvantaged PC going down, but it sure brings you into the moment.<br/><br/>The one-to-three round structure of the rolling and the end-consequence that can come up (dice damage) means both sides really care about the dice every time.  Also, the fact that the GM doesn't say a thing in conflicts between players meant that even if I was off my game that didn't impact their excitement in rolling it out.  In D&amp;D the players would be looking at me every time they rolled to describe / decide the outcome.<br/><br/>Finally, the fact that dice can't be refreshed mid-chapter makes traits an unpredictable timebomb in the story; that timebomb is the losers getting weaker, and (often) that means more desperate.  But at the same time, low dice = on the owe list, so reversals are possible as the giant gets brought to his knees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151835/#Comment_151835" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T08:50:33+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  8:50AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hot!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151865/#Comment_151865" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T10:54:34+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 10:54AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely. It is <i>the</i> secret weapon to have in you bag on that rainy day when your group is weary and listless. I have yet to be in an IAWA game that doesn't spawn instant un-premeditated fun, even with players that don't have a lot of experience with story games.<br/><br/>More yapping about how it's a great "gateway drug" story game here:<br/><br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/97/try-something-new-the-indie-exploration-kit/" rel="nofollow">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/97/try-something-new-the-indie-exploration-kit/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
