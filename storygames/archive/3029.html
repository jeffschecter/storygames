I picture someone staring at his computer screen until his eyeballs begin to bleed.  The gangsters told him they'd kill his daughter unless he memorized this list of <i>ad hoc</i> neologisms.  He gazes desperately at the vacant heavens, and rends his clothes asunder.  "O Lord!" he bellows, "why can't I understand '<i>Gnarliburr</i>'?!?!?!"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is <b>totally, completely, unfair of me</b>.  For all I know, people really <i>have</i> experienced distress trying to figure out the jargon on the Forge.  And that's what I'm wondering about: for all our discussions about how jargon might serve as barrier to discussions for a <i>potential</i> newcomer, I'm wondering how big a problem it's been for <i>actual</i> newcomers.  If that was you in the Gnarliburr example, like.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow has the jargon on RPG discussion sites negatively impacted YOU personally?  It's one thing to say that having to learn a few silly words is a burden; I'm curious to know how big of a burden it truly is.<br/>\n<br/>\n===My Own Case===<br/>\nI started reading the Forge in late 2004.  I usually avoided the GNS and Theory folders because I personally only wanted stuff I could touch.  Every so often, out of boredom, I would read a GNS thread on RPG.Net, which was always a huge waste of time; I'd occasionally check out the Forge Glossary, which was a waste of time for different reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't understand any of the jargon.  And it didn't matter a bit.  I was on the Forge to learn about fun new games, and figure out how to be a better GM.  And everything worked out fine for me.  I didn't need the jargon, unless I needed to argue on the Internet with complete strangers over abstract nouns suited to analyze Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It was no biggie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I discovered <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">Vincent Baker's Hardcore Role-Playing Theory Pages</a>, which were (for me) utterly lucid and easy to understand.  It took me, maybe, 30 minutes at most to understand these jargon terms.  And I'm glad I learned the ideas, but it's not like I was <i>suffering</i> for not knowing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the whole jargon thing strikes me as odd because it was never a huge part of my experience with these sites.  To me, the jargon was (a) a non-issue, and (b) a trivial burden to overcome.  Apparently this is not the case for others, and I'm curious to know if others have had far worse responses.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69022/#Comment_69022" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T15:04:55+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  3:04PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience was very much like your's, James.

The hosts (who as I gather are pretty trad-heavy) discuss GNS based on the wikipedia entry for it.  Its interesting to say the least since it isn't an "outside looking in" perspective, its more of an "in the lobby of the mall but looking in the curio shoppe window" perspective (they are gamers, not "normies").  I especially love how they mention Ron Edwards by name as if he's the diplomat for New Zealand or something.<br/><br/>All in all, they make a few good points, but they really sound frustrated.

The counter-intuitive nature of the terms is a consequence of terms being invented <i>ad hoc</i> by people who didn't realize they were inventing terms.  It just kind of stuck.  I suppose someone could come along now and clean shit up--like, "The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast" is goofy, and Alex is right to prefer "Authority Paradox"--but that has its own problems.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">(c) people who have mastered (or thnk they've mastered) the jargon and theory sometimes have a bit of an attitude</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSometimes, but in my experience that depends on the person and the site.  For what it's worth, <i>personally</i> I've found folks on S-G, for example, to be pretty friendly, laid back, and knowledgeable.  I have found certain of those qualities lacking in, say, RPG.Net discussions of the GNS stuff.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">(e) a lot of the jargon and discussions, even AP examples (took a while to figure out what that meant, even), seem very meta- or meta-meta-, to the point that the discussions (not necessarily the play) becomes so abstract that it's not an interesting tool for me to understand gaming</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThat's very interesting--I haven't noticed that myself.

Can you cite an example of this?  I've found the ideas as I understand them, to be pretty well nailed down.  But I haven't paid very rigorous attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually see the term "groupthink" whenever a group of people are blind to an obvious flaw in their perceptions, or are doing something very inefficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some aspect of play (or design) which you think the Big Model has either (a) completely missed, or (b) handles very inefficiently?

Personally, I'd say that bad jargon from the Forge has negatively impacted me the same way it negatively impacted you -- by wasting my time.  <br><br>The difference is that I was involved in theoretical discussions, so it probably wasted rather more time for me than it did for you.  Prior to the Forge, I'd been involved in RPG theory discussion and had a website with essays.  Thus, on the Forge I hung out on the theory and GNS forums a lot.  I did get various useful ideas from discussions there, but rarely from anything associated with the common jargon.  (Like the discussions of myth and ritual and bricolage, Chris Lehrich's mystery ideas, Emily Care's coverage of concepts from dramatherapy, and others.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69038/#Comment_69038" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T15:42:02+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  3:42PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I am always curious as to why this specific request is so upsetting to many people.

As I hinted in my first comment on this thread, I view that there is, at any given time, an accepted set of beliefs which, to varying degrees, are the "canon." This evolves over time, but there's a consistent enough lineage leading up to The Theory (of today).<br/><br/>The Theory is tied in strongly with the lingo; we know that words (lingo) shape viewpoints (theory), so this is going to have some effect no matter the situation. But since there are rarely competing theories to The Theory, the lingo that evolves is heavily based on The Theory of the moment (notice how older terms are said to have fallen out of use).<br/><br/>This conflict between The Theory (i.e. a specific, generally accepted theory) and theory (the body of knowledge and techniques for examining games) plays out in the lingo as well.<br/><br/>PS: I'm not saying this to say that you all <em>are</em> groupthinking, but rather that it <em>sounds like</em> groupthinking from the outside. (This is another effect of strongly lingo-based theory discussions; they not only are hard to understand, they also convey the impression that everyone who understands also agrees with each other on the theory.)<br/><br/>Does this make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69053/#Comment_69053" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T16:33:06+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  4:33PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite><br/>Is there some aspect of play (or design) which you think the Big Model has either (a) completely missed, or (b) handles very inefficiently?

The ones I'm aware of tend to be focused on player reward mechanics, but I suppose there could be Pull techniques for setting or system too.  Sorcerer's Kicker is kind of a Pull.  So are Keys from Shadow of Yesterday.  So are Aspects from FATE.  So are Bonds and the various Limitations in Nobilis.  Come to think of it, <i>maybe</i> the Humanity definition of Sorcerer can be viewed as sort of a Pull technique, operating across several sessions of play: the GM is saying, "Look, in this particular campaign, I will give you more resources if you behave according to this definition of virtue."  (I'm not 100% sure if the roll to lose Humanity counts as a Push.)<br/>\n<br/>\nElapsed time: 25 minutes, 10 of which was spent thinking.

When I first discovered the GNS theory and read into it, in detail, I was elated that somebody had FINALLY taken the steps to produce a cant that put ideas about games into force.  Rather than discuss things in circular Q&amp;A sessions until all parties knew what each other were talking about, one could merely reference a phrase and it was understood.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean that I adhere to GNS theory as the messiah of game-design:  no, actually quite the opposite.  I find the terminology very handy to discuss game designing amongst game designers, and that is all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find the ideas that the terminology is built from (and upon) to be very enlightening, but of little use to me personally.  I think that the best thing the theory jargon has done is to give us a solid definition of things that go on during design and play.  No longer do verteran gamers or game designers have to 'guess' what the other is talking about, we now have an archetypical phrase that references exactly what we are talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this excellent facet of the jargon has also led, at least somewhat, to its own undoing.  I mean if you want a stoic and well-versed definition of a term, just go and look it up in the provisional glossary, but there have been too many references to an entire essay, a particularly verboose thread done some years ago, or a rally-cry from other debate that is now thrown in assuming that EVERYBODY has memorized each and every point ever made, defined, or debated.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot long ago something I was said when I was mentioning my self-defined 'cool factor' ,about some extremely abstract and non-quanitifiable characteristic that excellent games have in spite of their shortcomings, an entire volume of essay was referenced assuming that I had searched through each and every character of prose ever written and grappled with the author's concepts.  Because my entire intent was pigeon-holed into terms already in place in the jargon, and very ill-fitting ones at that, my entire prose was debated on the content of the wording, not the idea, and definitely not the intent.  And no, I have no hurt feelings about that; aggressive debate as such helps us all grow.  If I cannot relate my points, in my own owrds or in jargon, then I need to add weight and clarity to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the jargon grew out of such an elephantine volume of written text, this seems to have become an inherent character flaw within the jargon.  Those that speak only in the jargon try to peg everything said into it without exception, and those who do not tend to not even chime in when the jargon tossers start throwing the jargon about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am resolute that the jargon spawned from the Forge and GNS has given us all a central terminology to reference.  But I find the idea that ALL should only speak in this mystic code of jargon to be very prejorative.  That's not the case here so much as it is other places, as everyone here, on both sides of the jargon or theory fence seems to have an excellent sense of "no feelings ever hurt" honor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if I wanted to pose a question to Jason Morningstar here, or to Levi, or others that speak the jargon fluently, I would use such phrases that are under my proficiency to better communicate with them.  If I were talking design points to somebody that has barely even heard of GNS, I wouldn't be talking about pushing my pops, and pulling my bangs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I'm speaking to everyone, I use my own words.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ultimate view is that the jargon is extremely handy to describe convuluted and complex things in a simple manner, but it shouldn't be used as the only means of debate and communication amongst us.    English should be just as accepted as the Forgian Dialect, from both sides of the fence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, I always felt thast we should be discussing ideas, opinions, and points...not whether actor stance or character motivation are the correct phrases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69088/#Comment_69088" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T19:20:05+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  7:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's harmful to me only in that the Forge became about it, instead of about independent publication, which was its original purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69089/#Comment_69089" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T19:22:41+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  7:22PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, man.

I cannot think of a topic that would not have been helped by using plain english to describe what someone is saying TO ME (ie meant for me).  Instead I see a handful of topics that come to a crashing halt (here and at the Forge) by using the word Sim.  Now the conversation isn't about "How do I Drive Home the Sim in my Hero game" rather it's "what does Sim mean to me?" (and no, I am not going to spend even more time trawling through posts to find examples - lest I then add this post as a way jargon wasted my time).  I would be amazed if someone could honestly say they have never seen that happen.  I think it even happened during one of these jargon discussions.  Even if I know what some term means someone else does not and my using it only muddies the discussion waters.  It's not exacting, rather it's lazy.  I understand what Joshua's trying to say but in many cases I don't think it's coming across to the people it's intended (unless one is only communicating with a few people that agree with their interpreation of the term).  I find it's better to either hash out what you mean instead of using a term that your intended audience has differed opinions on or to link the term to some link that clearly states your use of the term.<br/><br/>Again, not because I am unwilling to "got look it up" rather because I THINK I know what you mean but it may become obvious later that we're under different assumptions of it's meaning.<br/><br/>A good example is the word "significant."  A large majority of the population will read that word and say "I know what that means - important; meaningful; substantial."  And they will use it again and again cause it's a cool word.  They'll say "the number of people in the US using drugs is significant."  And I will argue that "no way is the percentage of the population using drug greater than 95% (the statistical meaning of the word)."  Or if I use significant in that way will someone even bat an eye at it's meaning.  They just assume I am saying it's substantial and that is obviously underestimating the point.<br/><br/>So that's my jargon AP with a little hypothetical non-gaming example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69144/#Comment_69144" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T06:55:43+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  6:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2007 6:57AM by Matt Snyder.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, I just don't see how that in any way refutes anything I'm saying at all. "Brain damage" are still just words. People either get mad at them or not. The words don't do a thing. Which is what I said.<br/><br/>Every time people get tied into fits about the Forge, they furiously point at "Brain" and "damage" together like it was some kind of hate crime. You can get mad about it, or not. It's still not the words themselves doing a damn thing. Get mad at the people saying them, or take responsibility for not understanding them, or responsibilty for your own anger, or whatever it is you decide is just and fair. Deflecting that responsibility onto the words themselves as though they're some force of nature is phony.<br/><br/>Furthermore, you'll note that I was responding the Fred, who used this phrase: "Jargon's utility as a barrier." (he also used the term "rigor-of-discourse crap"). He the went on to use the term "jargon" two more times. Yes, this thread is called "Forge language," but I was responding to Fred's use of "jargon." I think that was fair. Hope you do too. And, more importantly, I certainly hope Fred does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69172/#Comment_69172" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T07:49:38+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  7:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also possible at times to encounter words or phrases which you don't know, and they might or might not be Forge Jargon (or whatever).

If you're not feeling confrontational, please inform me, so that I may berate said ass within an inch of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a personal bone to pick with anyone who thinks that they're smarter than somebody else, just because they've taken the time to learn something specific that the other has not. Knowledge is not Intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not an acceptable behavior to me to berate somebody for not knowing something, nor to anyone else I can think of who have valued opinions about jargon or the theory behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it's me, tell me. Say, "Mike, thou art being a fuckwit." How else am I gonna learn?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, while I'm at it... Remi, did you intend your comments to Kynn to come off so harsh on the thread with the "goat-throw" reference?

It's disruptive and derailing to have such conversations together in the same thread.</p>\n<p>I think they are certainly <em>tolerated</em> and I'd find it unacceptable if they were not, but there is a clear distinction between shop talk and education and I don't know a single place where they willingly intersect. I don't think that's accidental.</p>\n<p>Separating education and production makes each one more useful.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>As a postscript I also want to express my frustration about what I perceive as a sense of entitlement to mentorship on the part of some members of the population.

If you keep coming back someone will eventually bother to explain something to you, but it won't make any sense for another six months. I have to say, I learned a whole lot this way.<br/><br/>I also went to the school where everyone explained everything they did and went out of their way to help the new people. I made a lot of friends there. I learned some things, too. But not at the same level as the first school.<br/><br/>There are all kinds of schools and all kinds of students. With a bit of luck, the matching pairs find each other.<br/><br/>(I wonder what it means that I learned the most at the first school but teach like the second?

A simple google search on 'goat throw' reveals its meaning, although I think the gist is easily gathered from context. Kynn demonstrated this. In the context of the sentence 'goat-throw' appears in there is no difference between the meaning of Kynn's made-up story and what throwing the goat actually is . I saw, I believe correctly, that the question was not intended completely honestly, but was an attempt to bring the larger debate about mentorship, jargon, and outsiderdom to a thread that was about none of those things.<br/><br/>Kynn's question was also asked without adding anything substantial to the thread (a very, very easy task), and I have requested, twice, that he participate fully in the conversation. I would read Kynn's story carefully, and ask questions to greater understand his game experience, and I would hope that he would do the same. My hope is that our discussion would be about our mutual love of games, and not about trivial misunderstandings of vocabulary.<br/><br/>Yet I am an exclusionary monster ogre. So be it. I do not want the larger jargon conversation in the Awesome Gaming thread, and I stand by that.

I think there are not a great many available teaching styles when it comes to all things RPG. The hobby itself got by for many years with texts that were pretty hardcore sink-or-swim -- learning how to game from the DMG (as I did in the very beginning) required a huge investment from the student. There was also an oral tradition among game groups, who passed along their how-to knowledge largely through the act of running games and picking up on cues and methods through direct experience (with very little or no explicit explanation and review). Again it was a case where, if you kept coming back again and again, eventually you would pick some stuff up.<br><br>This, of course, breeds the hardcore and sidelines those with casual interest. The same is true in any hobby with little explicit teaching among the practitioners (like skateboarding, say).<br><br>I think we have been developing a few other teaching styles in the past decade or so, particularly in regard to game texts written as teaching tools. We have a long way to go in that department, but the trend is well underway. Ironically, it was the desire for different and more explicit teaching tools that led a lot of people to the Forge, where the much-maligned jargon was born. I, for one, did not find the exclusionary, face-on-mat lesson style when I went to the Forge, but instead found a class full of people falling all over themselves to explain as much as they could to everyone around them. I admit I arrived at an auspicious time for that.<br/><br/>Anyway, to help students find the teachers they need, first we need a trained and motivated teaching force. Vincent is one, though he has been quiet lately. Ben, Brand, Mo, and John Kim too. But we'll need more, and different kinds, if our goal is outreach and inclusion (not one of my personal goals at the moment, btw). Until then, we* have a system that best serves the quiet guy who shows up and gets thrown around by the black belts for a while and accepts it with good grace. The black belts may be a little more talkative than they used to be, but they're not ready to release the comprehensive introductory DVD set yet.<br/><br/>*The "we" here refers to the whole hobby intarweb: RPGnet, ENWorld, The RPG Site, and all the rest. Not just SG and the Forge.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69419/#Comment_69419" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T19:01:49+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  7:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Remi, for what it's worth, I had the exact same reaction to Kynn's post that you did.

Which gets you into big flamewars.<br/><br/>Those flamewars weren't as ugly as your other basic RPG forum flamewars (e.g. about which system is better, or about whether Exalted sucks, or about whether new D&amp;D is like a video game, or about whether paladins can eat babies and still keep their alignment). And a few people did get it. Also, to be fair, the gibberish came as much from my lack of conceptual comprehension as it did from any overuse of jargon.<br/><br/>But, yeah, Forge CML made me waste a few hours on crappy Internet forums.

A pen-and-paper game you play has to be some kind of story-like thing in order to work, in order to come together and be sensible and play out in a reasonable amount of time. Too many people seem to assume that a TRPG is instead some kind of world simulation and treat it as such, ignoring all the important story stuff that the group is doing in play. That first conceptual hurdle, I think, is a pretty hard one, especially for folks who've only played big "physics engine" games like GURPS or D&amp;D. The texts of those games often make it seem like stuff like pacing, scene-framing, &amp;c. is secondary to the overall goal of "create a believable reality." (N.B. This isn't an argument about "physics engine" RPGs -- we can have that later. But anyone using a "physics engine" game still uses basic storytelling techniques, such as the ever-popular and always-present "skipping the mundane crap you don't want to play out," in order to make the game work. It pays to actually pay attention to that.) <br/><br/>My unabashed opinion is that, no, whatever system you're using, you'll get a better game if you realize that you're still subconsciously using all these storytelling tricks and meditate a bit on how those work. I find it significantly easier to figure out the idea of "game as story" if you've messed around with "light" games, chat-based freeform, writing stories, &amp;c. I don't think this is an obvious thing for everyone. I don't think it was always particularly obvious to me, for example. Without that first conceptual leap, I don't think the other stuff quite makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69494/#Comment_69494" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T23:21:07+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 11:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How forge terminolgy ruined my life:<br/>\n<br/>\nGirlfriend: What's this Trollbabe?<br/>\nMe: Its uhm, a roleplaying game.<br/>\nGirlfriend: it looks dumb.

Forge language has touched me in the bad place and continues to do so from time to time. And usually I'm not even flirting with it when it happens.<br/><br/>The incidents usually follow this sort of scenario. Someone on a forum much like this one brings up a topic that appeals to me, and one that I feel I can constructively contribute to. I start talking about my personal beliefs about what makes a game better and how I have applied these beliefs while playing and designing games. I try to avoid any jargon--often to the point of dodging shortcuts like GM and RPG--but occasionally some will slip in.<br/><br/>And then I inadvertently use some word or turn of a phrase that a has a clear meaning in the context of what I'm saying; but also has a significantly different meaning when viewed through the filter of Forge language. The resulting miscommunication often ignites a completely useless argument in which both sides are actually talking about different topics that are only superficially similar. Like an entomologist and a mechanic arguing about the merits of beetles.<br/><br/>Fortunately, none of these arguments has had a lasting impact on my friendships. But I will say they have caused a lot of undue stress, and because they occur on the Internet and involve a relatively insignificant subject, when they do happen, nothing in the world seems more important than winning them.<br/><br/>So I have learned to become much more cautious and guarded when discussing over the Internet how I really feel about games. Hell, it is getting to the point where I'm afraid to use the word <i>play</i> casually because I feel it is on the verge of meaning something I don't intend it to mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69499/#Comment_69499" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T23:41:22+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 11:41PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doyce</cite><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Also, I asked in whispers what<b>"Brain damage"</b>refers to.

But I think for anyone who supposedly upholds the Forge standards here, it's hypocritical not to then follow them all, or follow them only when convenient. Which is to say that I think that James, even if dead wrong about stopping the conversation here (which I don't think he is), even then has been wronged. How can you tell another person to take something to whisper, or to start another thread when appropriate, and then not do so yourself when asked?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this thread could, in fact, benefit from some splitting off.
