If you haven't seen it you should.  It was excellent.  City Hunter had a mix of several elements, and I was trying to figure out what game I could use to recreate them.  The ideal thread respondant has both played a bunch of indie games and seen City Hunter, but feel free to suggest either way.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of action scenes, and while flowery and cool they are not the emphasis.<br/>There is awesome investigation stuff in which the characters are trying to publicly embarrass each other, and trick each other in a wide range of ways.<br/>There is a lot of character interaction where multiple characters want the same thing, but in different ways, and end up coming to blows.<br/>Most challenging, there is a constant stream of character linking, right to the end as characters discover they relate to each other in different ways.<br/><br/>The last almost reminds me of a taste for murder, but the action/investigation doesn't really fit that.  So what is out there that has a chance of doing this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383236/#Comment_383236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T13:56:33+00:00" title="June 24, 2012  1:56PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm assuming this is a Korean adaptation of the original Japanese anime/manga <i>City Hunter</i>.<br/>There aren't too many games that can really capture the feel of City Hunter, at least in its entireity, in my opinion, and those that <i>could</i> manage it would need some hacking because their settings tend to be closely integrated to their rules.<br/><br/>Anima Prime by Chistian Griffin would be my first pick. The skills would have to be revised to reflect a modern urban setting that has merciless mercenaries, lecherous investigators, and enigmatic thieves all vying for attention. The powers would need to be renamed and revised to represent perhaps particular martial techniques, gun tricks, maneuvers, specialized weapons and gadgets, etc.<br/>The way characters can connect with each other would also be a good match.<br/><br/>The next suggestion would be Ammo, by Gray Pawn, which is actually a hack of Anima Prime, if I remember correctly. There are three versions of Ammo, Ammo:Deux v. Machina, Ammo:Revenant War, and Ammo:13th Mercenary Corps (which was a revision I wrote). They focus almost exclusively on the action and lots of guns, and have an interesting system of determining plot developments between action scenes. Still would need a bit of hacking to reflect a world not-necessarily at war or being torn apart by otherworldly forces...but is considerably rules-lite and kinda fun (particularly for the effect ov tossing your dice on the table, one at a time, like gunshots).<br/><br/>The way Apocalypse World works would be great for City Hunter, but as yet there isn't any Apocalypse-powered hack that really covers modern adventures... Opportunity, anyone?<br/><br/>Along the less-than-indie route, you could use the venerable Feng Shui system, but taking away all the mystical stuff. For something that, at face value, would work but would realistically need to be revised to make it workable, there's Hong Kong Action Theater.<br/><br/>But yeah, those are my suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383280/#Comment_383280" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T20:35:46+00:00" title="June 24, 2012  8:35PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There are a bunch of action scenes, and while flowery and cool they are not the emphasis.</blockquote>\nThat's the easy part, then, so let's not dwell on those.\n<blockquote>There is awesome investigation stuff in which the characters are trying to publicly embarrass each other, and trick each other in a wide range of ways.</blockquote>\nIs the actual investigation relevant to you, or is it more of a backdrop for the social conflict and maneuvering?\n<blockquote>There is a lot of character interaction where multiple characters want the same thing, but in different ways, and end up coming to blows.</blockquote>\nThis part makes me go "<i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>!"\n<blockquote>Most challenging, there is a constant stream of character linking, right to the end as characters discover they relate to each other in different ways.</blockquote>\nTo me, this part screams "<i>It's Complicated</i>!"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383309/#Comment_383309" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T05:54:18+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  5:54AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I think there is some relation to the anime/manga, but it is a very distant one.  Korean City hunter is a much more personal thing.<br/><br/>So the investigation of City Hunter is really a form of intercharacter conflict.  One character is trying to trap another and publicly humiliate him with his corruption.  Another character wants to prove someone really is the vigilante.  Note that I never said find out if someone is corrupt, or find out who the vigilante is.  That is all given.  Instead it is about the characters digging up dirt on each other as part of their central conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
