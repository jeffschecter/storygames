There is no freak show - there hasn't been a freak show anywhere for a good while. The best you can do at the <i>state </i>fair is "world's largest horse". We're there to people watch, mostly, maybe grab a funnel cake, see what's up. It's a mixed crowd and young - lots of hollering and racing to and fro. One of the rides is blaring tinny calliope music, which is fighting with a crushingly loud techno mix coming form the midway. All the carnies and show people are wearing royal blue polo shirts. The guy running the Trabant ride is super rough looking - greasy hair plastered over wizened, sun-blasted skin, some kind of visible dent in his forehead, prison tattoos - he smiles and lets a pretty girl on the ride without collecting any tickets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276795/#Comment_276795" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T10:52:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2010 10:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I heard there was a clown who juggled chainsaws, nothing on this earth would stop me from going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276805/#Comment_276805" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T11:37:13+00:00" title="June 18, 2010 11:37AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2010 11:37AM by Krippler.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of my friends have figured out how the local chocolate wheel works so whenever they're hung over they go there and win two kilograms of chocolate.<br/><br/>A guy riding a bear would make me go.

I was with my maybe two-year-old son and his mom.  We weren't a couple, but no one who didn't know that should have guessed it.  There was this one carny who let her and the boy on the ride free, but made a point of stopping me and collecting tickets while leering at me.

It's 5 bucks to climb one of the easy routes, or 10 bucks for a one shot try at the hard route, for which there is a $100 cash prize if you can sound the buzzer at the top. Having a lot of actual rock climbing experience, I size up the route and enquire about the rules."No rock climbing shoes allowed. If you slip off but catch yourself before you touch the ground, you can continue climbing," the carny says through yellow teeth. I continue to study the route while my friends go get some refreshments. The route certainly looks tough, with small holds distantly spaced, but I think it is within my range. While making my assessment, I see a couple other fair goers try and fail. They say the holds are slippery. When my friends return and ask if I'm going to try, I shrug. "I would if had some chalk for my hands."<br/><br/>Laying in bed that night, I continue to think of the moves I might have tried if I had bet on myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276819/#Comment_276819" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T14:10:10+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  2:10PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I go, because I love fun.

Whether this is nepotism or child labor is murky.   A notable protege is PEE-DOG, a slouchy spoiled brat, back from State U for the summer.  His frat brothers gave him the name when he stood, blind drunk, pissing in the fridge one early morn.    Pee-Dog has a girlfriend, Peg, who tagged along with him, back from school.  A couple nights ago (far from the first time) she spread a tarp on the couch and attempted to strip off his pee-clothes and sponge his legs.  He mindlessly kicked-out and broke her arm.  She just told you this, as she sat beside you at the apex of an otherwise-empty ferris wheel, during an early-afternoon break, before the public is allowed-in.   Not just her arm, but the spell is broken too: her kneejerk maternal role toward Pee-dog is over.  There's an awful void now, but here she is and this is her summer job commitment.  Pee-dog saw you up there.<br/><br/>Down in the back of a tent, sprawled out across two bales of hay is a greasy Manson lookalike, charismatic even with a top front tooth missing and Skoal stains.  Immaculate white t-shirt and filthy light blue denim jacket + filthy light blue bell bottom Levis.  He's not local, and but he's not with the carnival, either.  He drifts.  He works different fairs or carnivals, travelling his own route.    <br/><br/>Incredibly, there's a small red-brick slit-window building on the Dane County Fairgrounds, which is a minimum security facility for women age 18 - 21.  Too old for juvie, but too young for prison-prison.   Behind the building is a 20' chainlink fence containing a scrabbly garden, and soon after dawn the young women are issued gardening implements and sent outside wearing far out-of-date shorts and bare-midriff tops donated by the local thrift store.  They stretch and blink at the sun like it's Groundhog Day, and then kneel or bend-over to garden. Mr. Denim Manson Skoal befriended one such prisoner talking thru the fence, and learned that she has a work-release deal at the Donut Shop.  Each morning she has 45 minutes to walk to the Donut Shop.   Then the manager calls the jail to say she's arrived.  At the end of her shift, the manager calls to say she's walking-back, and she has 45 minutes to return to jail.<br/><br/>Denim has been meeting her in the hay bales and giving it to her hard and good each morning, then contributing a substantial portion of his pay for a quick taxi ride to get Jail Girl to work on time.  In the afternoons, the taxi brings her back, but they just share cotton candy and a couple quick rides before her deadline.   Big Barry saw one of their trysts thru a whole in the canvas, but it remains to be seen whether he'll exploit it.   Ambi the contortionist saw Barry oogling the tryst. Most years Barry puts the moves on Ambi during the blow-off, right before the carnival operator negotiates next year's deal with Barry.  S-O-P: Ambi takes one for the team to lubricate the deal.  But this year Barry muttered something about Ambi 'getting old' so the standard deal is in question, and she's a woman scorned.<br/><br/>Here comes Barry and the Fat Sherriff, making the early-evening rounds to with a lockbox and shotgun, collecting cash from all the gates and concesssions and rides, in a golf cart Pee-Dog banged-up goofing-off yesterday.  Ramming your golfcart, actually.<br/><br/>I could go on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276939/#Comment_276939" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T08:37:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  8:37AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2010 11:06AM by Todd_L.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I will.<br/><br/>OBVIOUSLY, the 4H volunteer is your girlfriend's mom.  Or she was your girlfriend in high school, but the long-distance status is unclear, ever since she went Back East to the ivy league, and is on a summer program in Morocco.  You're trying to stay-in good with the mom, because that's all you can think to do.<br/><br/>Your affiliation with the reform-minded 4H lady puts you at odds with Barry's good ole boy network, but he butters you up, because that's how he treats everybody; and he simply can't look at a young fella without assuming you're a scumbag on the make like he once was.   And maybe he's right.  Peg is a nubile angst damsel in distress, and whether you're her dickless confidant or something more is up to you.    You're bigger than Pee-dog.  His power is his family name.<br/><br/>Denim sees all, and dispenses salty wisdom. (Or maybe it's whizz-dumb.)  You and he have a bond, based on being odd men out, of sorts.<br/><br/>Denim's in a bit of trouble that only you know about.  There are ID badges for fair employees, and Denim cracked a sexual joke at the girl who shoots the ID photos.  She's the Fat Sheriff's youngest daughter, and a god daughter of Big Barry.   And she's only 14.  She recounted the incident to an old biddie-- a school lunchlady working concessions during the vacation; and the biddie is all hot-and bothered, inflating the story into a near-rape.  She's trying to get Barry to tell the Sheriff about it.<br/><br/>How this will go over with Ambi and the Tattooed Girl and the Lady Blockhead et al. -- is an open question.  On one hand they they're performers, so they have a dramatic and theatrical distaste for Injustice.  But, then again, Denim isn't really one of Them (gabba gabba hey), and show-folk don't appreciate Denim raising scrutiny from local law enforcement.  Plus the female performers all see themselves as roving feminist evangelists.  But sometimes their feminism is more half-baked and from-the-gut, than coherent.  So they could go either way on Denim's fate.   Jail Girl is fanatically loyal to Denim, tho.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276972/#Comment_276972" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T15:14:21+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  3:14PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there's nothing wholesome about the carnival, then?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276976/#Comment_276976" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T15:44:40+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  3:44PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you ever been to a carnival?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276996/#Comment_276996" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T19:03:04+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  7:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2010 7:29PM by komradebob.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Have you ever been to a carnival?</blockquote>\nI rather like carnivals, but then I work on Bourbon Street, so what do I know...<br/><br/>I am sorta shocked noone has mentioned the Volunteer Firemen's Tent where you get to see any number of respectable working class guys and their wives and their slightly more middle-classish bosses and their wives getting bombed out of their minds on cheap draft beer.<br/><br/>That, and a bunch of teens from all the surrounding towns cadging cheap draft beers from said tent all night long.<br/><br/>By the close of the carnival each night, the entire midway smells of wet grass, mud, and cheap beer in equal parts. And belgian waffles.<br/><br/>What do you see? Depends on when you're talking.<br/><br/>The cleared out empty field that belongs to the township that hasn't been used for anything interesting you can recall since the last year when the carnival came in to town. The first day, the trailers and trucks are there, having arrived mysteriously like mushrooms after a spring rain, even though you can quite recall seeing any of them come down any road into town. That morning, they're unpacking, but nothing looks like anythinng you can quite identify just yet.<br/><br/>By afternoon, the rides and booths are up. A few locals you recognize are milling around. At 5, the rides are starting and a few people are there.<br/><br/>Just before sunset, you get there. The sky is summertime sunset purple red. The lights aren't quite bright yet, not in any way you really notice.<br/><br/>By 9:30, the sun has finally set, and the glow of the place blocks out the stars that you can almost always see clearly in summertime. When you finally leave at around midmight, the night seems blaccker than before, and you're blinded by the head and tail-lights of the cars leaving from the now-muddy field where they've been parked. The normally green field is littered with plastic cups,half eaten hotdogs, and cheap plastic bendy whistles in neon colors. Here and there are broken strings that once had a roach clip on one end and some painted feathers on the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277173/#Comment_277173" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T17:33:48+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  5:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Droves of outlaw bikers from across the state line-- are arriving now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277246/#Comment_277246" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T06:52:06+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  6:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Have you ever been to a carnival?</blockquote>\nPoint.<br/><br/>Ok, so!
