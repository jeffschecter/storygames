"It's like, wow" syndrome. I've noticed it in Spione and others. While I can play these games, I had to translate  them into my own terms.

Wow, how could they do such a thing, it's just not right, man. What can we do about it? Let's make a game!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all about taking some external to one's own culture issue/part of history and trying to internalise it/sympathise with the happenings on one's own terms.

I can't be sure about what Kamil thinks or percieves, but there are things that *can* be too close: if someone made a game in that vein (personal stories in a tragic frame of war) about italian freedom fighters (partisans) of WW2... it would be grating. <br/><br/>Could be an excellent game,  but I don't think I'd ever play it: it's a wound that's too recent. There have been mythicized (?) and romantic stories about partisans, and they are just as grating. For each story of heroic resistance against the nazis and the fascist army there's one about partisans stealing, raping and killing political opponents to prepare for after the war or simply for revenge. <br/>My grandmother always told the story about what the women did when they (living on the forested hills of piedmont) heard that nazis were around: she took my father (who was 5-6) and fled in the woods. And of what the women did  when they knew partisans were around: they fled in the woods.<br/><br/>So, I think I can relate to Kamil feelings, to a degree: some things are just too close.<br/>(same, or worse, would be something about the seventies terrorism)<br/><br/><br/>That said, I'm actually quite interested in Grey Ranks, personally, and I'll probably get it, sooner or later, and play it.<br/>(I'm sure Jason has done his best to treat the matter with taste and historic accuracy, btw)<br/><br/>Kamil: would you feel the same about a game much more far away from you?<br/>Say, Carry, for example, about Vietnam.<br/><br/><br/>...as for "Normal" people (notice the capitalization), I dunno: I don't know any. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>"Normal" to me is synonim with boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162468/#Comment_162468" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T12:45:13+00:00" title="August 13, 2008 12:45PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip, <br/><br/>I'm curious about how you translated my word "good" in terms of the game Grey Ranks.  For you it became "romantic, patriotic and dramatic."<br/><br/>Now, I've only played twice.  Patriotism never entered the game, as far as a could tell.  Though the kids in the Ranks were in the service of the war... right?  I mean, that is true, isn't it?<br/><br/>As far as romantic and dramatic... that's in the eye of the beholder, and I have a lot more to say about that.  But this thread looks like it's about to fray into million-points-of-discussion land, so I have to figure out how I want to proceed.<br/><br/>But I will say that when I wrote "good" I meant the the love or care the characters had for people in their lives -- parents, siblings, loved ones.  That's what the game gave me, right there in the mechanic.  It simply wrote large the idea that when one is in horrific situation like having your nation overrun by invading army that: 1) life sucks; and 2) sometimes fighting to keep the invaders out costs things like the people you love and you.  While I don't know as much about the Warsaw Uprising as I do about the events in Iraq, I can certainly see the same tensions and costs taking place in a wartorn country.<br/><br/>So, that's what I meant by good.  I just wanted to make it clear you and I got two different things from the text and the mechanics.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162493/#Comment_162493" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T15:49:39+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  3:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2008 3:52PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Filip,<br/><br/>Thanks for responding...

Especially bringing out Iraq will not help us reach consensus, for sure. It's one of the points where we can only hit the cultural rift immediately."</i><br/><br/>... to be one the stranger statements I've read on the Internet for a while.  I have no idea why you think you can't talk to someone from another nation about international matters.  <br/><br/>And I have no idea how I'm so defined by my citizenship I can't be spoken to.  You suggest Americans have differences of opinion on policy... but these differences are leveled by American citizenship?<br/><br/>But whatever.  You've somehow decided how I perceive war -- though we've never discussed the matter. (I know there's an Internet mind-reading machine out there!

That Chris is American, and that we may or may not be a militarily agressive nation have absolutely nothing to do with each other. One thing that is both infuriating and pride-inducing about America is that our national identity and our individual politics can be incredibly varied, as can our national culture and our individual cultures. <br/><br/>Do me the favor, if for no one else, and judge us all by our individual actions, regardless of our countries of origin. That you are a Pole makes no difference to me. I am unashamedly ignorant of whatever cultural biases your country may have, because I simply do not care. When you and I interact as individuals, your personal biases, whether characteristic of your countrymen or completely alien to them, are much, much more important to me. <br/><br/>Also, this discussion is interesting to me, which is strange. Like you, a lack of interest in the subject matter of Grey Ranks has made it unlikely that I will ever play it, even though I acknowledge that I may be interested in the themes.

If I were to tell you about the Vancouver slam poetry scene, I would start with broad brush strokes and work towards illuminating differences between it and your experience.

I think that's how people explain things.<br/><br/>And if it's a game, you want to simultaneously point out what is important to get behind - thematics, colour, whatever. You essentialize, highlight, and then dissect what is unique about that place and time. That's how explanation of anything works, in my experience. It's also how exotifying and stereotyping and glorifying work, I think.<br/><br/>How would you seek to explain something without doing "this"?<br/><br/>Alternate approach: Can you point me towards a game with a setting (real or fictional) that doesn't do this?

Games based on historical events are about the freedom to imagine what it was like to be there. That's a basic human endeavor, imagining. It can't be anywhere close to the real experience. But, its not trying to be. I wouldn't want to be in the real occupied Poland during the resistance any more than I would want my head eaten by a dragon. Or, to strike closer to home, I wouldn't want to have joined some of my ancestors in the camps in Germany, but I read Anne Frank and watch <i>Schindler's List</i> without apology.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162559/#Comment_162559" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T06:48:12+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  6:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kamil,<br><br>You've already expressed that sentiment.

Eric says that if I "care" about Darfur but don't do anything about it, I am self-deluded.  A delusion is something that isn't real.<br/>But this actually raises another interesting question: when dealing with something as ephemeral as "caring" what is the difference between truly caring and delusional caring?  Actually, I take it back.  Eric's statement answers this question: true caring is caring upon which one acts.<br/>There is a question, however, about what counts as "action" for determining whether caring is real or delusional.  If, after posting here, I go into a corner and bawl my eyes out thinking about Darfur (or about child soldiers that died in the Warsaw uprising) is that action enough to make the caring "real" even if I'm not actually acting in such a way that makes an impact upon the world?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162608/#Comment_162608" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T11:34:20+00:00" title="August 14, 2008 11:34AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lowbrowgames</cite><br/>My biggest fear with Grey Ranks is an incentive to do overly dramatic things in the game for the sake of the fiction and to feel appropriate to the mood and playstyle.

To pass judgment on the history.  To express opinion and affection and empathy inspired by the history.  <br/><br/>DitV does this, Spione does this, Grey Ranks does this, carry does this, Steal Away Jordan does this.  There's gotta be dozens more that do it.  I'm working on a project that does it with Sengoku era Japan.  Even though I'm not Japanese, I see a lot of things in the history that really resonate with me, that excite me, that piss me off, that make me sad, that make me ask myself questions.  So much so that I want to make a game about those things.<br/><br/>The history is real.  The art is also real.  You can stylize, alter, distill, or combine the history, but that doesn't make the art any less real.<br/><br/>I can see where somebody might be turned off by having their own history be co-opted by an oustider for purposes of creating art.  I personally think such a person should just suck it up.  No offense to anyone.

What I think is internet silliness at it's finest is the idea that this mean that someone, the people who are disturbed or the people who play, is "wrong" for doing so.<br/><br/>We turn history and facts into fiction, to be able to understand them. It's the way our brain works. To take the most disturbing example: people who did not experience the nazist death camps can only hope to get even a glimpse of what it was only by experiencing these facts as stories. These are only a weak and diluted manner of exchanging experiences, and it's perfectly normal that they are dismissed by people who experienced that in person or by a close friend or family. But without these stories there would be no way to communicate, at least weakly, that experience.<br/><br/>By the other hand, turning facts into stories mean distancing yourself from them. It's only from a distance that you can create fiction from history (and this not limited to history's horrors: people too near something can't create good stories from them. Think about when you saw last time the holiday's pictures of somebody, with him or her telling you what every photo shows...)<br/><br/>For example. I am Italian. Renato already talked about some recent polemics here about the partigian's role in the war. Politics. From a day to the next heroes can turn into war criminals and then turn again to heroes, depending on who write the scripts for the news. But let's say that somebody do a game about the WWII in Italy. Could I play it? Sure. If I could play a freedom fighter killing nazis and fascists by the dozens as in a old hollywood movie. Or even in a more realistic setting, but still using the tone of the story as a distancing device. (it's what most spy games do, anyway: in most of them you don't play someone who plant bomb to kill civilians, or capture students to rape and torture them, right? That's unreality for you. Or Even Westerns, or most games of D&amp;D that don't give a rat's ass about how people really lived in the middle ages). If you remove that distancing device, if you start talking about what really happened to the civilian population... I could not really play it. It's my parents life that I would play about.<br/><br/>I have no problems whatsoever in playing a game of Carry, instead. It's more distant, even if it's closer to our time. I could create a story with it. And it wouldn't have to suck (players inspirations notwithstanding...), because it would be a story not about the specific experience of someone who was in the Vietnam (an experience I can't have) but it would be a story about my human reaction about what I saw about it from movies, TV and books. That distance would help me metabolize and use that historic material in a way that I couldn't use with events closer to me.<br/><br/>I don't think that Jason's games aren't "for normal people", because they work in this "normal" way. Normal even for old rpgs that people play every day without thinking about it.  How many WWII games have you played? How many spy games? How many westerns? How many martial arts games? How many games where you investigated a murder? How could you? Think about people who got someone close murdered. How can you play a GAME about it? How can you even see FICTION on TV about it?<br/><br/>It's very normal doing it, it's very normal never notice it, it's very normal seeing it only when, after all this time, it touches you from a lesser distance, and think "this game is not for normal people", even if you have always played in your life games that did the same thing with other people's heritage, without even thinking about it.<br/><br/>Jason's games only turn the flashlight over to some other target, and not the usual ones that people are accustomed to and are "safe" because "everybody is doing it". And for this I applaud him. Even if some of these I could not play myself. Stories are the way we learn, and with no stories, history would fade into oblivion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162665/#Comment_162665" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T13:49:07+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  1:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well-reasoned post by Moreno is well-reasoned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162666/#Comment_162666" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T14:07:36+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  2:07PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just like to point out that I haven't been trying to attack or defend anything.

And I got the idea that distanciation happens because if there would be no distance, there would remain only the mere facts wich mean nothing. What does it mean that nazis killed people even for fun? That means nothing. It has no meaning, it has only historical value, but humanely means nothing. It's just there. It happened. So I think it is not even possible not to have a distance. Our language forbids it. If we tell something, that has a meaning, so that's not only the fact, but it's the meaning of it, and the meaning is already fiction. Did you mean that or is it only my understanding?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Jason Morningstar, I won't play your games! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7309/jason-morningstar-i-wont-play-your-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Jason Morningstar, I won't play your games! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7309/jason-morningstar-i-wont-play-your-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="You guys should see if you can be more melodramatic in your responses.

I was saying that the Malvinas War was just too close to home for me to game it. I have friends who lost dads and uncles or brothers there. <br/>However, I have figures, both Argentinian and British troops. I painted them.

I am sure that if someone went into your house and killed all your family, you would find that fact would mean something to you. But maybe you would not be able to create a story about it or play a game about it. (and, at the same time, if there weren't people who observed that fact from a distance big enough to be able to write about it in a newspaper, nobody would know). <br/><br/>I don't want to classify any reason for this or that. In these things, trying to classify mean avoiding understanding. Maybe it hurt too much. Maybe you are fed up from the stories that your parents told you every day of your life. Maybe you feel shame. Maybe you are too angry when you think about it.  Maybe you simply already talked too much about it. This was not what I talked about, this subdivision of motives mean nothing. You motives are your own. You play the games you want to play and you have to justify your choices to nobody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162948/#Comment_162948" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T04:56:38+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  4:56AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Kamil, <br/><br/>Thanks for your candor, and especially for unpacking your reasoning a little.  It's really useful to get this sort of feedback.  I worry about people making the characters in <i>Grey Ranks </i>overly melodramatic too.  I tried to build the game to discourage that, but people can obviously take it where they like.  If it helps, I've never heard of a game that went off in overly melodramatic or wildly ahistorical directions.<br/><br/>Filip, sales to Poland that we can track are pretty low and exclusively .pdf.  There's a lively torrent out there, though, so I'm hoping some people who will appreciate the game are getting it that way at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163073/#Comment_163073" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T16:21:01+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  4:21PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>"I don't think that Jason's games aren't "for normal people", because they work in this "normal" way. Normal even for old rpgs that people play every day without thinking about it. How many WWII games have you played? How many spy games? How many westerns? How many martial arts games? How many games where you investigated a murder? How could you? Think about people who got someone close murdered. How can you play a GAME about it? How can you even see FICTION on TV about it?"</p>\n<p>FWIW, my mom dislikes murder mysteries for that very reason -- because they take murder as a given, emotionally neutral, the subject for an intellectual puzzle.  That bothers her.  (For a similar reason it drove her nuts that my dad loved to watch <em>Hogan's Heroes</em>.)</p>\n<p>And no, as far as I know nobody she knew was ever murdered.
