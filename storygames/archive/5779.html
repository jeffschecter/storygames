It sounds like they've been bottling up all this stuff and not sharing it because they were worried about how people would react.  And they can't take it anymore, to the point that Ryan was considering not reading or posting on Story Games or even severing ties with this portion of the indie games scene entirely.  And it sounds like they really have to get this stuff off their chests because it's really bothering them not feeling like they can say it.  And they basically want people to say that it's okay to do this and create a space for that to happen.<br/><br/>Am I reading that right?  If not, can you help me better figure out where you're coming from?<br/><br/>If so:<br/><br/>1) That sucks.  I'm really sorry you felt like you couldn't point out what you thought were "obvious problems" with various games.<br/><br/>2) Was that really the case?  Do you really think people would take your head off for saying that you thought "Say Yes or Roll The Dice" sucked?  Me, I'd go, "That's cool.  It didn't work for you.  What do you prefer instead?"<br/><br/>3) Do you really need the community's permission to criticize stuff?  It seems like the consensus is that you should just do it, in whatever way you think best.  And if you do it in a way that's awesome, then people will be like "Yeah, that's really awesome!"  But if you do it in a way that makes you seem like an asshat, then people might get really upset.  Or is the worry really that people will think you're being an asshat when you're really not?  I guess that might be hard when asshatitude is so subjective, especially on the internet.<br/><br/>4) I forgot what issue 4 was.  If I think of it, I'll post it in a followup.<br/><br/>Honestly, I got this vibe when the discussions that led to The Owlbear happened last time too.  Just the sense that people were bottling their criticism and brewing hatorade with it, which seems like a really unhealthy practice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129507/#Comment_129507" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T17:59:32+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  5:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, Jonathan.<br/><br/>No, I'm not asking permission to criticize.
