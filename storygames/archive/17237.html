Insofar as this is not the case, you're not. If we need to get even more specific, we can look at the nature of the activity around the table: is it predicated upon (that is, dependent on as a prerequisite) "exploration" of the "shared imagined space"?<br/><br/>Both "Exploration" and "Shared Imagined Space" have very persnickety definitions that tend to make it pretty obvious whether some activity is roleplaying - at least I haven't had any trouble drawing the lines in practice, and I dare say that I've considered some pretty out there forms of play and non-play.<br/><br/>Other traditions of rpg thought have different definitions/assumptions (often the thinking is not codified, so it's not so much a question of definition, but rather of perceiving what a person is assuming). I demonstrated this in 2004 with a nice Ven diagram that showed the three partially overlapping dominant rpg schools of thought in terms of what they consider a roleplaying game. Aside from the Big Model definition above I'm pretty happy with these descriptions:<br/><br/><b>Traditionalist:</b> traditional rpg thinking utilizes a family resemblance heuristic. This means that for something to get categorized as a roleplaying game, it should bear sufficient resemblance to games reified by the tradition as important roleplaying games. Thus e.g. having a GM, being about dungeon crawling, involving characters modeled by attributes, xp reward systems - all of these and others are features that make it more likely for a traditionalist to consider your activity a roleplaying game. It's a matter of cultural history to define what is a roleplaying game as opposed to some other type of game, like defining which works belong in the Pre-Raphaelite canon.<br/><br/><b>Immersionist:</b> Nordic immersionism particularly seems to focus on the idea that roleplaying is ROLE-playing, and thus the topic and subject matter of rpg theory are games where individual players have individual character relationships that can be described as "playing a role". This usually, but not necessarily, involves immersion into the role on an emotional level.<br/><br/>I find it intensely interesting that the stupid perennial Internet debate about what roleplaying is obviously cannot be resolved once you accept the very postmodern fact that there exist in this world multiple models of thought that are differently useful for different purposes and different people. A term like "roleplaying game" will be utilized in <i>useful</i> ways by people who have different concerns, which can be clearly seen in the above comparison between prominent schools of rpg theory. Thus the only people actually debating this sort of thing are the ones ignorant enough to never have encountered genuinely different needs and models of thought.<br/><br/>To demonstrate this, consider the game <i>My Life with Master</i>: a Forgean theorist will recognize it as a roleplaying game because clearly a fiction is being utilized as a playground. A traditional theorist will have misgivings, for cornerstones of traditional design are clearly being flouted; I think he would be justified in claiming that a break with tradition has occurred and that this is "something else", although he might not necessarily do so with a game that still has a GM and players and where at least something happens in the imagination. An immersionist will likely criticize the same game for how it violates internal sanctity of characters and interferes in "pure roleplaying" by insisting on using dice and framing devices; he would likely claim that MLwM is not a good vehicle for roleplaying, and not properly a roleplaying game, but rather a boardgame of some sort.<br/><br/>As an even more radical example, consider <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>: I have met immersionist roleplayers who quite seriously tell me that they consider the activity of playing this video game "roleplaying" in the same sense that they use for what they do while e.g. live-action roleplaying. I have no reason to disbelieve, clearly this person is just focusing on internal experience of immersing in character (or world, or plot, or whatever) as his measure of whether roleplaying is present or not.<br/><br/>As for what a person should do in this sea of definitions and theories, I would suggest the postmodern approach: select models and definitions that serve your own interests, and communicate them clearly to others where necessary. For example, the reason for why I myself usually utilize the Big Model definition of roleplaying is that I've found that it is effective in capturing the feature of roleplaying that I personally find centrally interesting in roleplaying: games that are roleplaying according to this model are consistently interesting for me as "roleplaying games", and games that are not practically never are. This makes me think that there is something to this definition, while e.g. the immersionist idea of character immersion is something on which I am profoundly uncaring - it does not correlate with what I find interesting in the hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391016/#Comment_391016" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T08:37:49+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  8:37AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lately, I've pretty much only been working on games that operate right in the middle of board games and RPGs. My personal feeling is that worrying about these distinctions too much tends to get in the way of making more interesting and provocative games. Plus, it makes it more difficult to market or explain RPGs to those who are unfamiliar with them or weirded out by them.  When I tell people about my game design work I tend to say: "I make experimental board games." And that's something they can easily imagine and possibly connect to. In the end, it's all tabletop. The real divide is still between digitial and "analog" games, but even that is being bridged more often these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391019/#Comment_391019" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T09:01:37+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  9:01AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone who sniffs "your RPG is too much like a board game" doesn't play a lot of board games and probably knows nothing about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391022/#Comment_391022" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T09:28:06+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  9:28AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2012 9:30AM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the game have rules for pretending that your playing piece or side or whatever is a person?

I tend to think of the one hard requirement for an RPG being that the player has one character/persona (or a very small number of them) that they control within the game world, but it's really easy to find edge cases and things to quibble about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391028/#Comment_391028" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T10:47:04+00:00" title="September 21, 2012 10:47AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero has nailed it for me.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391035/#Comment_391035" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T12:14:12+00:00" title="September 21, 2012 12:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My two questions would be: <br/><br/>1) Are role-playing and board gaming exclusive?  (i.e. Could there be a "role-playing board game"?)  <br/>2) How and/or why is the distinction important?  <br/><br/>Personally, I prefer to define a role-playing game based on relatively common/intuitive conceptions of "role-playing" and "game".  This would exclude some shared-fiction games like Once Upon A Time or the shared-creation-of-an-encyclopedia game whose name I forget.  On the other hand, I don't think it's a big deal to vary in this label.  <br/><br/>So I would say that the two aren't exclusive - If a game involves role-playing and uses a board, then it is both.  (For example, I had an article on using a board with My Life With Master - <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/mylifewithmaster/board.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/mylifewithmaster/board.html</a> - though I haven't tried it yet.)                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391043/#Comment_391043" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T16:20:59+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  4:20PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are role-playing and board gaming exclusive?  (i.e. Could there be a "role-playing board game"?)</blockquote>\nI don't see any reason they should be exclusive. A board game is just using mechanics that encode part or all of the game state in terms of tokens and their spatial positions. That definitely applies to all sorts of things that are used in RPGs: from miniatures on a gridded battle mat, to poker chips as Fate points/bennies/whatever.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I'm all in favor of these sorts of things. I think that by moving part of the bookkeeping and state-maintenance of the game into physical space, they can simplify the players' jobs and let them either focus more deeply on the fiction, or make the fictional world broader. (As an example of the latter, the D&amp;D style battle mat lets the fiction encompass more details of where people are positioned in space, which you can't really do in any detail otherwise.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391087/#Comment_391087" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T08:24:36+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  8:24AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As usual, Eero's brilliance illuminates all.
