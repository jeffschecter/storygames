The winners will (depending on what they are) have happened, been active or been published in 2008.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're (rather self-importantly) calling these awards the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.britishgameawards.com/" rel="nofollow">British Game Awards</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\u2019d love to hear ideas of what deserves an award. For example, you could nominate:<br/>\n<br/>\n* An overlooked game, released in 2008.<br/>\n* A games designer who was active in 2008.<br/>\n* A convention that happened in 2008.<br/>\n* A games forum that was active in 2008.<br/>\n* Or, in fact, anything RPG-related that happened, was active or was published during the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can nominate your own product, if you like, or even yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo feel free to nominate things or people from outside Britain for British Game Awards. We\u2019re called the British Game Awards because the judges are British and we\u2019re judging from a British perspective. However, many of the games we play are from abroad, so we won\u2019t limit ourselves purely to British games and events.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo nominate something, send an email to submissions [at] britishgameawards [dot] com. In the subject line of the email, put the name of whatever you\u2019re nominating. In the body of the email, tell us why you think it deserves more recognition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly nominate one thing per email. Don\u2019t send more than two nominations per person.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you nominate, tell us how we can find out more about whatever you\u2019re nominating. For example, point us towards the webpage of the publisher. Don\u2019t nominate things that we can\u2019t find out more about: for example, don\u2019t nominate a GM who we\u2019ll never meet or a convention we can\u2019t attend before December. We\u2019ll do our best to find out more about anything that\u2019s nominated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a publisher, then to ensure we see your product, you can send it to us. You can:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Attach an electronic copy to your email.<br/>\n* Send a physical copy to British Game Awards, c/o Pelgrane Press Ltd, Spectrum House, 9 Bromell\u2019s Road, Clapham Common, London SW4 0BN, United Kingdom.<br/>\n* Give a physical copy to one of the judges: Simon, Steve, Graham and Angus will all be at GenCon US in August. We will also be at all the major UK conventions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny physical products sent to us will be sold, for charity, at the Dragonmeet auction. Please sign it, or get the author to sign it, before you send it! It\u2019ll fetch more money that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no formal closing date for nominations, but the sooner you nominate, the more time we have to find out about whatever you nominate.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that we won\u2019t give a game an award without playing it first. We can\u2019t guarantee to play every game that\u2019s nominated, but we\u2019ll have played any game that gets an award.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe judging panel are:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Angus Abranson</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAngus runs Leisure Games in London and is the director of Cubicle 7 Entertainment, the publishers of the upcoming Doctor Who RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Steve Dempsey</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSteve Dempsey is the editor of Places to Go, People to Be, the respected gaming fanzine. He runs tabletop and LARPS at UK and American conventions and is a strong advocate of the indie gaming scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Simon Rogers</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSimon Rogers runs Pelgrane Press, publishers of the Dying Earth RPG and the GUMSHOE system, including Trail of Cthulhu and Esoterrorists. He co-owns ProFantasy Software Ltd, creators of the industry standard Campaign Cartographer map-making software.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Graham Walmsley</b><br/>\n<br/>\nGraham is the author of Play Unsafe, a book about improvisation and storytelling techniques in roleplaying games. He is a member of the Collective Endeavour, a collective of British game designers, and regularly runs LARPs at UK Conventions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155230/#Comment_155230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T12:00:18+00:00" title="July  7, 2008 12:00PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, a bit problematic for December 08 releases?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155233/#Comment_155233" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T12:13:32+00:00" title="July  7, 2008 12:13PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Hm, a bit problematic for December 08 releases?</blockquote>\nGame-related things released too close to or post the deadline will be considered for the following years' awards.

Nominations are coming in, but mostly for British things, and the award isn't restricted to British things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you published something in 2008, do nominate it. If you have other non-game ideas, nominate those too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
