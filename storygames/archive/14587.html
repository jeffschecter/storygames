Like, in the middle of the gunfight, you want to run off with the hostage.  It's not an attack, it doesn't help an attack or set up an attack or recover or ditch.  So how does that work?  You get in your car, take the hostage to the airport, fly to another city.  None of those are your turn, and the protagonists can't roll dice because it's not their turn yet.<br/><br/>Sooo, how is that <i>supposed</i> to work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bislab" title="bislab"><img alt="bislab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bislab">bislab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332171/#Comment_332171" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T19:44:13+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  7:44PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like an AID action to me.

(I'm not a big fan of the shoehorn-everything-into-a-negative-adjective approach, as I think I mentioned in another thread, given that adjectives are meant to be the primary means by which you affect the fiction.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332188/#Comment_332188" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T00:11:18+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 12:11AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So, if you say, "I grab the hostage and jump in the car", and I interupt and say, "oh, but I bull-rush and tackle you both to the floor", wouldn't we just roll for MY attack?</p>\n<p>But then, I've yet to play Technoir, and I've only read through the playtest rules once.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332189/#Comment_332189" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T01:08:20+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  1:08AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2011 1:37AM by C_Edwards.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Vasco has the right of it. Since your hostage and your hostage-taker are both NPCs you, as the GM, just telegraph that the hostage-taker is taking off with the hostage. Telegraph so that the players have a chance to respond. If the PC's move to stop the hostage-taker than you've got a contention on your hands, or a continuation of the current contention if the hostage-taker is currently involved in the gunfight. The results of that contention determine if/how the hostage-taker gets away. Maybe the PC's have their hands full with other opponents and let the hostage-taker go. It could play out all kinds of ways.<br/><br/>As the GM, having your NPC decide to try and escape is no different than having an NPC take any action that doesn't directly effect a PC. You just do it. Like I said above though, it's usually pretty important to give the PC's a chance to act or react. Especially if the NPC is already part of an ongoing contention.<br/><br/>*Basically, telegraphing the hostage-taker attempting to leave IS the turn for that NPC. The scope of an "attack" (and by extension other actions that don't require rolling) during a contention is pretty granular because it's tied directly to the specific action you're taking. The hostage-taker isn't likely to get very far into the escape attempt before the PC's have an opportunity to respond.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332223/#Comment_332223" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T07:29:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  7:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...  Well, that's what I've done in the meantime, thanks.<br/><br/>The kidnapper wasn't taking part in the gun battle, so it's reasonable for him to create a "separate threat", I suppose.  I guess part of the confusion is that I forget that there's really no such thing as an "ongoing contention".  You roll the dice and the contention is over, time for a new contention.  But that does bring into question the "everyone gets a turn" and the various "turn options" from the rules.<br/><br/>Just going to have to wing it until things are clarified.

If the PCs don't do anything about it than the NPC gets away. If they intercede then that's when you and the players roll dice about it. It doesn't matter if everybody was already rolling dice about something else or not. The PC's can still be attacked by other NPCs.

That's Ace's turn.<br/><br/>Shades returns fire, and now Ace is \u2022SHOT(-).  Scarface remains out cold.  That's their turn.<br/><br/>Red shoots Smokey as he tries to dive behind the bed, giving him a \u2022GUT WOUND(-).

It's only going to be the title of the chapter from now on.<br/><br/>An action\u2014and the rolling dice procedure that goes along with it\u2014is a complete unit onto itself. If it involves asserting a negative adjective on another character I call it an attack. If it involves asserting a positive adjective onto a character, I call it aiding. Afterwards, if it leads to another action in which you need to roll dice, great. If not, then you just play on in conversation.<br/><br/>You might have a scene in which a lot of people want to perform actions. So then there are rules for taking turns to do so.<br/><br/>Something I've learned during the playtesting is that the rules in the Contention chapter are poor rules for playing out gun fights. They are rules designed for manipulating other characters and you might just shoot guns at them in order to do so. <br/><br/>I've rewritten the chapter's text to make sure that's communicated better.

You're right, with a turn defined as doing one of the five moves listed on page 86 you have to look at the moves and adapt the one that makes the most sense.<br/><br/>In the situation you describe, Punky taking the hostage into that bathroom isn't an action that applies an immediately useful adjective that benefits Punky. Nor does it apply a negative adjective to the PCs. That action could be used as a Set Up move to create a positive environmental adjective (something like <i>locked</i>, <i>barricaded</i>, or maybe <i>defended</i>) that Punky or his associates could use if the PC's try to get into the bathroom, but that's about it. It can then only be used when Punky or his friends are active (GM is rolling dice for them) and not in defense. I think it would probably make more sense, and feel more natural, if Set Up created adjectives that could also be tapped for defense in the same way they are for an attack. Then a fictionally defensive action like locking yourself in the bathroom would be more useful and make more sense when it meets the mechanics.<br/><br/>As the GM, in this situation I wouldn't spend any NPC turns applying adjectives to the hostage unless I have reason to believe the hostage will be resisting the PCs at some point. It's not like I'm going to be rolling against myself and if I want the hostage to do something I'll just have him do it. Worst case scenario, I'll end up just giving an NPC some adjectives that are tailored for the situation.<br/><br/>*I also don't see any reason why Ace can't use Shoot as a defensive action against Punky's attempt to get into the bathroom with Dok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332342/#Comment_332342" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T17:09:05+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  5:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He didn't shoot Dok, because you challenged his vector (or I guess I assumed you did).

There is no 'he's going to do this -- what do you do?' moment, as in (say) Apocalypse World, or Sorcerer.

The vector thing is not a reaction from the character in the fiction -- it's just a player clarifying something that has already happened, and the GM forgot about.

Like in the example with Punky, I'd probably narrate him shooting at the PCs as he starts dragging Dok to the bathroom. Simple, easy, the PCs get a defense against the shooting and I've telegraphed the NPC's action in a way that gives the PCs a chance to act directly against that action on their upcoming turns.<br/><br/>As the GM, I do a lot of telegraphing in this game. Not that I don't do it in other games but it seems like a particularly useful technique in Technoir due to the specifics of the turn structure and contention rules. That and this part in the text...\n<blockquote>Characters can also adjust their position, move around, talk, draw or reload weapons, and fiddle with things during their turn. Only when causing one of the effects listed above does it count as the action for the turn.</blockquote>\n...is basically begging me to telegraph NPC actions. I think one reason I haven't had some of the difficulties that others have expressed is due to the techniques I've been using. Mostly just because they're "what I do" when I GM, not because I set out to solve any problems in play. One reason I like Technoir is that it seems to work pretty well with my default GMing mode. But it also makes it hard for me to see the problems others are having.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332401/#Comment_332401" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T01:39:41+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  1:39AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 1:47AM by Cneph.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all.  Long time lurker, first time poster and all that.  Anyway, nice to meet y'all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played in what was intended to be a playtest last night.  Character gen, connections- all good.  Liked doling out relationship adjectives.  Gear is a bit odd- the prices seem abstract- or rather I suppose the currency is (1 Kred == 1 Tag).  But it works, and is a way of managing in-game value of gear vs 'wealth'.  On the other hand, how much does an 'opulent' mansion cost?  The same as a 'filthy' hovel?  :)  A bit facetious, but I'm sure you get my point.  Presumably Kreds are intended to be a real-world currency too?  It's a bit hard to get a handle on the worth of currency in-fiction, when a cyber-arm costs less than a medkit.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, we got equipped.  Having Shark and Splice favours- very useful.  All fine so far, except this is the point where the session turned into a diceless freeform roleplaying experience with no contentions or anything, using the relationship adjectives as RP cues.  Which is fine fun to be having, but didn't really meet the objective.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had issues like- OK, Shades the PI wants to stake out the dam overnight before the deal the next day.  No-one to contend with, so we didn't roll any dice.  Should we have?  What about applying a 'Staked-Out' tag to the scene?<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything was a diceless IC scene.  Maybe we were doing it 'wrong'- should getting information out of connections be a contention?  We did have to cut the session a bit short- I suppose we could have seen a contention at the swap the next day.  But, we did struggle to find ways to apply the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have similar experiences?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332409/#Comment_332409" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T02:47:16+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  2:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 2:50AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

So far, across eight sessions of 2-4 hours in length, we've had 1 or 2 situations in each session where the dice came out. That ratio seems to fit with what was going on in the fiction.<br/><br/>I can't say what you should have done but I do think it would be cool to use the Set Up move to put a <i>staked-out</i> adjective at the dam. Then if something goes down there that adjective could be tapped as a sort of "I'm familiar with the dam" bonus.<br/><br/>We haven't had any PC-Connection contentions yet. Probably because right now the connections have so much leverage on the PCs from favors that the PCs have been pretty willing to do as asked, no connections have been working against the PCs (that they know of), and the particular relationship adjectives between the PCs and connections they've interacted with so far haven't been the source of any strife yet. The text doesn't seem to say anything specific about going to the dice (beyond rolling on the Master Table) to get information from a connection, but I certainly would if I thought the situation called for it.<br/><br/>If you really want to see more dice rolling then maybe more pressure needs to be put on the PCs? The NPCs should have agendas, from simple to complex, that they're going about fulfilling. At least some of these should cause conflict with the PCs in a fairly direct manner, and sooner rather than later. Maybe it would also help to remind everyone that character advancement requires conflict (and the taking of negative adjectives)? It's hard to say without having been present.<br/><br/>Was everyone dissatisfied with the pace of things, and if so, was there a reason they didn't get involved in any contention-worthy action?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332624/#Comment_332624" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T03:55:18+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  3:55AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris, thanks for your thoughts.  I was the one who remarked on the lack of 'system'- it wasn't so much pace, as 'here are things we might in other systems make rolls for' like f.ex. 'is this guy on the up-and-up' which we didn't figure to roll in TechNoir.  Not saying that you have to roll in those situations, or any other- it was just over the course of the evening none of the scenes seemed to have opportunities for the system to get involved.  Which is fine in abstract, but didn't really push the playtest, you know?  Though we didn't get very far in the scenario, and its possible more conflict would have come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that matter, it sounds like we specifically missed a 'Set Up' type of move at the dam?

The contention rules are at their best when you have active opposition to your action. There totally could be a contention in your "is this guy on the up-and-up" example. The way I'm seeing it the PC would be using Detect and the NPC would be defending with Coax. Initially at least. Maybe the PC ends up <i>fooled</i>, but the NPC could be <i>exposed</i> and escalate to some other action.
