Will they create assumptions about what the game "should" be like? Will players create new rules to incorporate the tools/props?<br/><br/>Anything you put on a table -- or don't put on a table -- will have an effect on how you play. That's assuming you even have a table. It's a different game if you have no table, and are instead outside sitting on the grass, or standing up looking at each other in a circle, or sitting audience-style in a classroom, or are out jogging around a track.<br/><br/>A lot of my games recently take place sort of "distributed" around a living room without a central focus, with people sitting on chairs and couches. This style of gaming actually bothers me, since the game we're playing (Dungeons and Dragons) isn't really designed for that kind of play, and what's more, it's not one I'm used to. My view of a gaming set-up for D&amp;D, involves players sitting a table, a DM at the end with a screen, and a map with miniatures in the middle.<br/><br/>However, my idea for <b>Bone White, Blood Red</b> is players sitting on the floor (or the ground or the grass or in a kiva <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) in a circle, facing each other. But nowhere have I made this clear in the written documentation (so far), just as most games never say anything about how you actually sit down to play them.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Is this obvious or not so obvious?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66735/#Comment_66735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T11:06:46+00:00" title="May  3, 2007 11:06AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that there's a ton of interesting research to be done in organization psychology and the psychology of creativity that's precisely along these lines, and someone who is in one of these fields should be either telling me why I'm wrong or writing up a proposal.<br/><br/>(Says the lapsed social science student)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66741/#Comment_66741" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T11:17:42+00:00" title="May  3, 2007 11:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you all looked at this?<br/><a href="http://www.sandtray.org/what_we_do.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sandtray.org/what_we_do.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66754/#Comment_66754" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T12:31:08+00:00" title="May  3, 2007 12:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Have you all looked at this?<br/>\n<a href="http://www.sandtray.org/what_we_do.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sandtray.org/what_we_do.html</a></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>You know what the most important part of that is? The reference to H. G Wells's <a href="http://www.classicauthors.net/Classics/Wells/FLOORGAMES/" rel="nofollow">Floor Games</a>. I've heard of his much more war-gamey <a href="http://manybooks.net/titles/wellshgetext03ltwrs11.html" rel="nofollow">Little Wars</a>, but Floor Games is approaching much closer to RPGs. We could honestly call it the true predecessor of RPGs, unless someone can find published rules for the game the Brontes used to play. But I'm not sure there ever were formal rules for their game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
