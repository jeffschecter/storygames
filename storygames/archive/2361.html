                    I'm running a 4-hour one-shot of The Shab-al-Hiri Roach this week, and was wondering if anyone had tips on running this game in a single session?  I played it at a minicon last year in a 4-hour slot with six players.  It was a lot of fun, but we were no where near getting through all of the scenes.  I've been looking on The Forge and SG for tips but didn't find any.<br/><br/>Should I simply cut out a few of the scenes and try to get through a shorter game?                </div>

                            Yeah. Six players is a lot to get through all six scenes in four hours. You figure you'll spend 30-45 minutes explaining the rules and making characters (experienced players need like 5 minutes, though). At a con, the game will start a little late, too. So say you have 180-200 minutes to play out scenes. If every player takes a scene in every event, that's 36 scenes, or about 5-6 minutes per scene. It can be done, but it's tough.<br/><br/>Just set down some guidelines like, "If we run out of time, we won't be able to do the last event." Realistically, plan on completing 3-4 events for all six players cuz people gab and have fun and stuff, and you don't want to squelch that.<br/><br/>When picking which events to skip, remember that you want a mix of events for Power and events for Everything Else, so the tenured professors and associate professors all get a chance to shine. I personally like the Convocation, the Trustees Meeting, the Follies (hilarious fun!), and the Football Game. I'll cut out the other two before those four.<br/><br/>I've run 12 players including myself through three events in about six hours, if that gives you an idea of pace (and my sanity levels).                        </div>

                            I usually ballpark 45 minutes to an hour per Event and plan accordingly.  Adam's advice is good, although I'm fond of bookending the session with the Christmas Ball myself.  It also helps to assume a strong facilitator role to move things along.                        </div>

                            I would remind players that they don't have to frame a scene each Event, so long as they get their cards played. I don't think it's really necessary to have six scenes per Event; with cooperative players you should be able to cut it down to three.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

                            I've actually only ever played this at cons, always in four-hour slots, and we've finished each time.  Paul's got the salient point: not everybody has to have a scene every event.  My advice is to run it all high-energy Crane-style and if nobody has an idea for a scene, move on to the next event and just keep moving.                        </div>

                            Things I know from doing them wrong myself:<br/>It helps to have a friend at the table to move through the first two scenes quickly. also, coordinate with this friend for a series of player-friendly character backstabbing. <br/><br/>Set a good example by skipping scenes when you've got nothing to add. Take a few minutes after each event to put up a tally of reputation and roachedness, and ask the players what they expect from the next event.<br/><br/>Things I know helped the demos and games I ran:<br/>Potentially helpful for new players are little cards describing the NPCs. Those can be passed around if someone takes their role and can be put on the conflict side. This helps avoid looking up their dice sizes.<br/><br/>Have roaches at hand, either like the plastic one that came with the first print run, or the candy ones which are available somewhere on the 'net.                        </div>

                            When I ran it in January it took us five hours for all six events with four players.  I think we mostly each framed a Scene in each Event, maybe 21-22 of the possible 24 scenes.<br/><br/>I can't offer our session as a model for speed, but I have a dry erase board where I wrote our characters' and each of the non-Pembertonian NPCs' names that I think helped.<br/><br/>I think good modeling in the first Scene is the best advice.  Having some examples of types of Stakes that might be set would be helpful too - there aren't many of these in the rules.  We tended to get stuck on these a few times, searching for something different than the kind of Stakes that had been set previously.<br/><br/>I don't think I'd ever care to play the Roach with six players.  If I had five, I might have people draw playing cards (1-5) for seating position and indicate that the number on their card was the Event where they could NOT frame a Scene and suggest strongly that they try to find another Event where they did not frame a Scene.                        </div>

                            The game was crazy fun, just like the last time I played.  We ended up with four players total, which made for quicker progress through the events.  We skipped the wine and cheese social and made it all the way through the GGG Xmas Ball in about 3 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>I may do an AP post later, but one of the highlights for me was watching biplanes back from the Great War doing a flyover of the stadium during the Homecoming Game.  One of the pilots peeled off and dove straight for the crowd as the pilot tried to machinegun his hated father.  That, and the stage set of the Pemberton Follies collapsing and getting set on fire by football players dressed as Ku Klux Klansmen.<br/><br/>Du Imasi Dudunu!                        </div>
