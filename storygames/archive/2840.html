And how this artifact can be made an interesting and rewarding part of play.  I'd love any ideas on how to re-use the map during play in some fashion.  I'd prefer that there to be a ongoing pay-off for the process of mapping (e.g. the map gets used again and again, not just as a reference but as some sort of mechanical resource during play).<br/><br/>Any suggestions and thoughts are welcomed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64497/#Comment_64497" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T20:02:09+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  8:02PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I consider maps to be "fun" as physical objects, charts of play, and encapsulations/summaries of story - whether as actual geographic maps or as relationship-webs.
