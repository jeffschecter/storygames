He is 12 and has been having a really tough year.  He's not been hugely into role-playing, but has had some fun with his cousins playing kid superheroes in PS238, and in a simple LARP that I ran (with pirates).  One problem is that he isn't very confident in his speech - so the more you can do with simple statements, the better.  He's into superheroes as well as fantasy and various machines, but not so much into animals.  <br/><br/>I'm thinking of trying Marvel Heroic - probably with a bunch of simplifications.  I also will be doing some kind of custom LARP. <br/><br/>I'm pondering about other indie games to try, though.  My son has really loved Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, but I think my nephew won't want to play a teenage girl.  I might consider an H&amp;H variant.  <br/><br/>I'm also thinking of Monsters and Other Childish Things.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368314/#Comment_368314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T06:41:59+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  6:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simple statements, hm?

I gave it a bit of a starting scenario, where players are Elementary School kids, friends who live in the same neighborhood that had been drawn together because of their strange, magical abilities. It includes a character sheet that has some starting questions that not only builds the relationship between the characters, but also creates some starting seeds of adventure.<br/>Also made cards for Gifts and Powers (basically more expensive Gifts), and resolution is pulling a certain number of dice from a bag, depending on whether they have any applicable Gifts, and trying to get at least one white die.
