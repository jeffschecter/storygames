<div class="Message">
                    Before Christmas, I ran a one-shot LARP, with a werewolf theme. It was very rules-light (any conflicts were handled by GM fiat or player negotiation) and it went rather well. <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17985.0" rel="nofollow">There's an Actual Play report on The Forge</a>.<br/><br/>I want to discuss one part in particular. At the end, some of the PCs (decided by a vote) changed into werewolves. I told those werewolves that they had five minutes to gather their pack for the final attack: by running into the convention hall and persuading as many people as they could to play werewolves.<br/><br/>It came off really well. They rushed off and, five minutes later, fifteen werewolves burst into the room, howling. I stood on a chair and shouted out some basic combat rules I'd worked out. And then there was a very quick combat, in which the werewolves died and some of the humans survived. It was a wonderful moment: I've got a very clear memory of fifteen (ish) werewolves lying on the floor after the battle.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, <a href="http://ozzy.rpg.fotopic.net/p23482649.html" rel="nofollow">here's a picture</a>.<br/><br/>I'm currently planning another LARP - the Meat Loaf one - and wondering whether to do a similar stunt.<br/><br/>Here's my problem. Correct me if I've got the theory wrong here, but this is illusionism, right? I'd decided before the game started that there'd be a humans-vs-werewolves battle at the end and railroaded the game to reach this battle.<br/><br/>Now, to be fair, the battle could have been reached several different ways. As it happened, the players decided to stay where they were and mount a defence, so the battle was a good ending. But if the players had gone hunting the werewolves, they'd probably have found themselves surrounded: and I'd have used the "final battle" ending. Hell, if the player had wanted to negotiate with the werewolves, I'd have let them: and then a rival pack of werewolves would have attacked them to end the game.<br/><br/>It's also important to note that I didn't tell my players about the ending or that there'd be any sort of surprise ending. (I prefer it that way. I like to surprise them.)<br/><br/>Now, looking through some of the past discussions on illusionism, it's often thought to be a bad thing. Some discussions compare it to cheating on your wife. Others acknowledge that it can be useful, if you tell your players what you're doing (which I didn't).<br/><br/>So help me out here. I'm not that well versed in the theory and I think it could be useful here, especially in designing my next game. Do I accept that I used a nice, high energy stunt to end the game? Or did I use a dysfunctional technique which I shouldn't use again?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            I don't have any LARP experience, but a little rail-type structure seems like a good idea when handling such a large group.  I think I'd make it explicit by giving the players an outline of how things were going to go down ("Scene Four:  Werewolf Apocalypse!") but I don't see the harm, myself.<br/><br/>That picture is priceless - it reminds me of our staff meetings at work.                        </div>

                            Well, it's hard to say if that is any more illusionist than, say, having a tornado come through the town where the larp is occuring. You don't appear to have been dictating an outcome or a response, only an event. <br/><br/>Were players somehow prevented from trying to stop the appearance of the werewolves? The litmus I'd use is if a player or group of players did something clever to completely avoid the battle (such as truly heavy fortifications or causing the deaths of everyone who might be a werewolf, including themselves) would you still have had one? <br/><br/>Illusionism usually means that player decisions didn't matter, but they had reason to believe they did. As you pointed out, those decisions did make a difference, so I wouldn't worry so much. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">"RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things."</a> </div>

                            Hey, :)<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I'd have a bit of trouble with the rival pack attack thing. As a player, that would have stung me a bit, I think. There's a risk with that sort of thing that players might feel their play is pointless or meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, though, I know some people who are just fine with that. They live to be surprised and watch the story unfold, and don't give a hoot whether their play has "meaning", whatever that may be. (Tehcnically, I'm guessing that's participacionism, rather than illusionism.)<br/>
<br/>
It all depends on the players you have and what they want to take out of the game, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            J,<br/><br/>But, the thing is, I'm <i>really good</i> at railroading. You'd have honestly thought that the rival pack attack came as a result of your actions. You'd have thought your actions were meaningful, even though they weren't.<br/><br/>For example, let's say you start negotiating with the werewolves. Fine. Then I bring in a werewolf NPC who says: there can't be peace between us while the other pack is attacking us. Other pack, you say? Yes, says the NPC, and they're coming here now. Half an hour later, the other pack attacks, I use my stock ending and it seems totally satisfying from a story point of view. You'd enjoy it. Really.<br/><br/>And even if you did find out that I'd duped you, would you care? I'd have ended the game with a high-energy bang. And you'd have loved that last combat. Isn't that better than letting the game fizzle out? You'd forgive for the railroad, wouldn't you?<br/><br/>(Thanks for the rest of the replies. I'll respond in a moment.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Would your players have more fun if they were unfettered by your evil designs, or does the risk of the entire event going off in the weeds require you to maintain a firm hand?  <br/><br/>This seems like a case where you need to draw a line between these two extremes.    The fact that you are good at providing a fun experience that veers a bit toward the draconian isn't, in my estimation, a bad thing.  Were I to enroll in an event where the moderator said "Look, no matter how you guys work this, in the end the fur is going to fly.  Seriously.", I'd be thrilled to work toward that end, knowing that the game would not go off into the weeds.<br/><br/>EDIT -- Not that I'd ever play your poncy werewolf LARP, mind you.                        </div>

                            Bullshit on "the GM has an event which will happen in mind, and it's going to happen, one way or the other" being dysfunctional.  It can be applied dysfunctionally, sure (like when this skanky GM I had in college fiatted that my character had to be enslaved to his . . . <i>even after I killed off the character and started a new one</i>).  But it can also be a really powerful way of creating plot that the players own in a <i>different</i> way from plot that they invent themselves.<br/><br/>Epic tragedy, for example, always ends in Doom.  That doesn't mean that all epic tragedy games are dysfunctional just because we know something about what will happen in the game's future.<br/><br/>It sounds like you gave the players plenty of agency in <i>how</i> your event was going to happen.  You didn't decide, "Okay, these people have to fight these other people, no matter what."  It sounds like you had an event in mind, but you were ready to contextualize it and give it meaning based on what the players were doing.  A story isn't just about the things that happen, it's about the meaning those things have to the people experiencing it; a game isn't just about the actions that you take, but also about what those actions mean to you.  In the context of our story-game-zombie-children-things, you can let people own the narrative acts, or the meaning of those acts, or both.  It sounds like you chose to define what the act would be (a fight) but let the players construct the context and meaning of the fight, and that sounds just fine to me.<br/><br/>I think you did good, your picture is hysterical, and I would have loved to play.<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: Believe me, all our hippie-nar-indie techniques can be applied just as dysfunctionally as illusionism can.                        </div>

                            Graham, <br/><br/>All depends on the social contract of the game. Which may not be helpful, I know, but <a href="http://yudhishthirasdice.blogspot.com/2005/06/illusionism-and-actual-play.html" rel="nofollow">its pretty much what most of my players told me</a> about my old illusionist ways. <br/><br/>Though, for a jargon police note: Illusionism is when you are railroading the players and they do not know it. When they do know that you're doing it, and are okay with it, it's Participationism. I know this probably seems like one of those "anal  jargon" things, but I think there is some real value in it. That value, of course, being the line of "it depends if your players want that or not. If they don't, it isn't good, if they do, it is." <br/><br/>No one, for example, has ever been unhappy because I GM fiated some terrible and funny thing in a Paranoia game. Because that's how Paranoia works. Do the same thing in most Dogs games, and you'll get treason right quick. <br/><br/>So, if'n you said to me, "Brand, I want you in a LARP in which the story will be told by the decisions you drive us to" and then did that, I'd bag you. If'n, otoh, you said, "Brand, I want you to be in a LARP with some strong external story elements" I'd be just fine. You can surprise me, just don't lie to me.                        </div>

                            Illusionism = railroading without the players knowing they're being railroaded. Or at least, with the GM trying to hide the fact that they're being railroaded. <br/><br/>So the GM who says, "All roads lead to Rome, but you get to chose your road" and lets you take your road, isn't an illusionist. The GM who says, "You can go wherever you want" but always makes the characters end up on the Via Appia into Rome, is a big illusionist. <br/><br/>At least, that's how I've always understood the term. The "illusion" is "the illusion of choice."                        </div>

                            Railroading isn't dysfunctional if everyone is having fun, and if everyone knows that they're basically being guided on the grand tour of thrills and chills or whatever. In a con game, railroading is endemic, and many very popular, enjoyable and successful con games are run as such.<br/>
I think most people expect a big finale, which does sound like more fun then a fizzle; even less structured con games usually have a constrained opening scene and a constained climatic big fight/showdown whatever at the end.<br/>
In a LARP, a lot of the fun is in the player interaction - the play, rather than the story; it's fine to relax into play, knowing that someone else is responsible to move the plot to the big finish. Unless that ending feels forced, intrusive and jarring. But that's where a GM's skill and flexibility comes into play.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and in a big Con multi-player game like a LARP, people damn well know there's a railroad. So no illusionism (per Brand's helpful definition), therefore, functional and Forge Glat Kosher.                        </div>

                            This is very useful stuff. Bear in mind, here, that I don't quite understand the theory, so any attempts to explain it are very welcome.<br/><br/>To answer some specific points: I don't tell my players I'm manipulating the story beforehand but, in the bar afterwards, I'll happily say "Oh, yeah, that would have happened whatever you did.". People generally react well to that.<br/><br/>So, J, I don't mind if players read this thread. I'm happy for them to know I'm forcing them into an ending.<br/><br/>Jason...
<blockquote>Were I to enroll in an event where the moderator said "Look, no matter how you guys work this, in the end the fur is going to fly. Seriously.", I'd be thrilled to work toward that end, knowing that the game would not go off into the weeds.</blockquote>
All right. But wouldn't it be rather thrilling if I didn't tell you that and, nevertheless, the whole thing ended in a fantastic climactic fight? It'd be much more surprising, wouldn't it? (Even if I explained to you, later, that I'd kind of engineered the whole thing?)<br/><br/>Mendel...
<blockquote>Were players somehow prevented from trying to stop the appearance of the werewolves? The litmus I'd use is if a player or group of players did something clever to completely avoid the battle (such as truly heavy fortifications or causing the deaths of everyone who might be a werewolf, including themselves) would you still have had one?</blockquote>
No, if they'd made it quite clear to me they didn't want a battle, they wouldn't have had one. I'd have found some other ending: perhaps the "Let's shoot all the PCs who we think are werewolves and see who survives" ending.<br/><br/>That's a very good point, actually.<br/><br/>Brand, I think you've hit the nail on the head with your "don't lie to me" thing.<br/><br/>I really have no idea where we're going with this thread, but it's interesting. Dotan, Jess, the reason I haven't responded specifically to your points is that they've got me thinking.<br/><br/>[Edited to add: I forgot to say.

                            Thanks, Jason and Olle, very useful. It looks as though transparency could be taken to different levels.<br/><br/>I'm definitely happy that, if anyone asks me before the game whether I'll railroad them, I'll say "I'll probably guide you towards an ending, unless you come up with something better".<br/><br/>I'm probably happy with making that public: "I've got an ending in mind, and I might guide you towards that, but if you're going in a different direction I'll follow you."<br/><br/>I might even hint at the ending: "Lots of werewolf stories end in a fight. If we go that way, that's great."<br/><br/>I'm less happy with making the ending public: "I'd like to end this with a fight. How you get to that fight is up to you." That's a personal preference: I hate stories with a known ending. I'd rather use some gentle railroading to guide them towards the fight. <br/><br/>I'm definitely unhappy with making the final mechanics public: "We're going to end in a fight. The werewolves will be given five minutes to go out into the conference hall and gather people". I think half the fun of those mechanics is that they're a instantaneous thing.<br/><br/>Olle, the link is interesting, but that definition of transparency is much more than I would like. That whole thing about "The scene you're about to play is preparation for a later scene?". It just sounds dull. (Perhaps we should start another thread on transparency, if we're going to talk about this in detail).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Oh, we should start another thread, because I'm surprised that you would think playing scenes to build other, later, scenes is dull - that's an improv Harold in a nutshell.<br/><br/>I built complete transarency into the Roach - you know everything that is going to happen, and in what order, but not how you arrive there.  It could be personal preference, but I think transparency is a feature rather than a bug (pardon the pun).  There are probably players who would not like to hear how the game will end, but there are also players who will see that as freeing, and allow them to work with you to make it as satisfying as possible.                        </div>

Sorry, that's my fault for paraphrasing badly.<br/><br/>Playing scenes to build a <i>defined</i> later scene is dull. For example, saying "We're going to have a marriage scene later. Let's play the scene where the couple first met." is dull because a. You know how it ends and b. What happens if, halfway through the scene, you decide it's more interesting if one half of the couple kills the other?

<p>Thanks for clarifying, Graham, makes more sense now.</p>
<p>Since the dull example above lacks zest (or seems to), I should come up with a counter-example, or just take this as input into how the example could be constructed.</p>

                            My take has been (and probably always will be) that illusionism is risky.  Out and out railroading is decidedly risky, and probably not maintainable when playing with adults.<br/>
<br/>
But illusionism can play out really well.  Or, on the other hand, it can play out really really poorly.  It does take a fair degree of skill, and once you have the skill it's very hard to avoid the temptation to use it.<br/>
<br/>
And one of the possible saves from a discovered illusionism is a deflection into participationism.  In fact, I'd argue that a lot of players make that jump on their own - they realize, and even come to expect, that the GM has something he's working towards, and is willing to provide them with latitude about how they get there.  <br/>
<br/>
The danger is that a player will discover the illusion, and feel betrayed.  And then it's really hard to save their fun, now in this game, or possibly ever again.  I think that ultimately the question over whether illusionism being inherently dysfunctional revolves around how great you think the chances are of this, and how much you fear that danger.                        </div>

                            It's funny. This idea that players feel betrayed comes up quite a lot in the old theory threads. <br/>
<br/>
But I've never actually seen someone react like this. I've told people, in the bar after the game, that I guided them towards the ending. They never seem to mind.<br/>

Sometimes, I think this "betrayal" thing is a myth put out by the narrativist propaganda machine.<br/>

<p>OPEN YOUR EYES NARRATIVISM IS A MYTH PROPOGATED TO SHIELD YOU FROM THE TRUTH THAT IS TIMECUBE</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>My take on illusionism/participationism is that it can be very functional; of course it is, since almost all of the GMs around me practice something like that. In the best versions of this, I see that the players gladly follow the key thread that's out there, because that's where the fun stuff is; in exchange the players have enough flexibility to apply their own take / solution to issues, and at times pursuse self-driven side-plots (but this isn't always appropriate). Things I've heard include "I've got to sit down and figure out the plot for the next episode", "this next ep will be more heavily plotted", and "I hope my character isn't messing up the plot you've set up" (I think this was when I didn't have one set up!).</p>
<p>The above is participationism, I suppose. And I'm pretty sure that's what you have: players who've come to expect that the GM to have a more or less planned thread in mind, with a likely ending, and they expect the GM to keep secrets like your ending. Your part of the bargain is to not be too obvious or narrow minded with the ending: if the players have achieved real, lasting peace by virtue of some really cool sacrifice or something, then it would be wrong for a GM to <em>still</em> press on with the plot thread despite what the players had done; that's probably when a participationy game goes off the rails, as it were. But the GM has a lot of leeway in setting up a scenario where everyone has buy-in into a very likely end, such that there's almost no chance of avoiding that ending, and that's okay.</p>
<p>One risk that could crop up is that a player goes in earnestly, and participates along, but ultimately is not 100% engaged in the thread that's there. Perhaps he was hoping for werewolf court intrigue. (???) So he's disappointed in the thread you provided, but that just happens sometimes. I think it's acceptable, and most RPG players understand the implicit social contract of participationist play.</p>

                            Thanks Dev, that's interesting.

Yes, that's a very good point. <br/><br/>For me, the point is to guide the players towards a satisfying end of some sort. Now, often, the most satisfying end will be something I've predicted in advance (such as a combat of some sort).<br/><br/>But it's possible the players will go in a completely different direction. For example, it's possible they'll start shooting each other, one by one, in an attempt to kill all the werewolves (because PCs can be werewolves too). That would be a fantastic ending.<br/><br/>If they do that, then it would be completely wrong for me to go "OK, guys! Stop shooting each other! Combat time!". It's my responsibility, then, to go with that ending and even steer the players towards it. For example, if 75% of the players are going in a paranoid "The werewolves are among us" direction, and 25% are fortifying ready for an attack, I should probably guide them towards the "Shooting each other" endgame.

Yeah. That's a question of communicating the tone of the game before it starts, isn't it? If I tell someone it's a freewheeling, tongue-in-cheek werewolf game and they expect White Wolf-style intrigue then, well, if they're disappointed, fuck 'em.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
