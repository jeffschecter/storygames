(More: http://www.dragonflight.org/dfcon.php)<br/>\n<br/>\nWho's going, and what are you playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be there, but haven't decided what I'm going to play. But, I sure had fun playing Apocalypse World at Go Play NW and wouldn't mind trying that again.  Other things I'm intersested in:<br/>\n<br/>\nMicroscope <br/>\nShock<br/>\nFiasco<br/>\nPolaris<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to get my board and war games on, but also want to do some role playing...<br/>\n<br/>\nDan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
