It is genius. The generic version ("The Pool") is free, but tQB is a gem and quite cheap<br/>\n- The Pool: http://www.randomordercreations.com/thepool.rtf<br/>\n- The Questing Beast: http://www.randomordercreations.com/rpg.html<br/>\n<br/>\nBut these are heroic little mice suffering setbacks and making deliberate choices about when they will risk it all, when they will shine, and when they will take consequences for the good of the team. There need to be explicit narrative-influencing mechanics and reward mechanics to bring that story out to the fullest. I don't think a modified tactical game (D&amp;D, Savage Worlds) will really deliver that Mouseguard feel.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344004/#Comment_344004" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T08:46:20+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  8:46AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What kind of game systems does your friend like?<br/><br/>What don't they like about the Mouse Guard RPG?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344006/#Comment_344006" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T09:05:30+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  9:05AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't know.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMust ask.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344011/#Comment_344011" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T09:30:20+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  9:30AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noodled around with a Trollbabe hack.

The final straw was when I read back over the conditions rules and we all realized they are even harsher than we had thought. I can try to reconstruct the various complaints over the course of the game about how the systems just didn't work for us. One thing to note, we may have had consistently weird dice*. Most players had double digit fate points stored up because most often when they failed a roll, they had no 6's to re-roll. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'm hacking Drift to give me a simpler alternative - since it already has belief-focused characters who change because of their experiences and challenges, but also supports quick, interesting mission design and a communal record of the world. We've already done character creation, although currently that group is playing through an Iron Heroes story arc (yes, enjoys Irons Heroes, Fiasco, and Nobilis, but cannot get Mouse Guard to work for them...), so after we finish that I plan to test out my Mouse Guard hack. <br/><br/>   - Mendel<br/><br/>* I am the guy who played 1001 Nights, rolled almost 20 gems, but still died before I got a turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344016/#Comment_344016" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T09:49:47+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  9:49AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2011 10:28AM by mease19.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Solar System/Lady Blackbird hack or Dogs in the Vineyard seem like the best systems to switch over to in terms of really pushing "what you fight for".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344022/#Comment_344022" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T11:07:15+00:00" title="September 26, 2011 11:07AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/mouse_guard.html" rel="nofollow">Tiny Triangles</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344025/#Comment_344025" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T11:21:20+00:00" title="September 26, 2011 11:21AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2011 11:23AM by jenskot.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies for the slightly off topic post:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>The final straw was when I read back over the conditions rules and we all realized they are even harsher than we had thought.</blockquote>\nThis is possibly completely unrelated to your experience, but I found that conditions were too harsh when I...<br/><br/>1. Made the GM turns too long.<br/>2. Didn't include the PC's relationships who can alleviate their hungry/tired conditions for free.<br/>3. Used more conditions instead of twists when players failed rolls. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> was especially a problem. It can feel unnatural creating missions that only start with 2 obstacles (with more obstacles introduced with twists). But going with shorter missions means more player turns, more Persona / Fate points, and more players giving the Prologue and thus alleviating a Condition or Taxed Nature (which also means Nature is used more, and players succeed more).<br/><br/>I still occasionally make missions too long, especially for 1 shots. But with 4 hours, it is possible to complete 2 GM and 2 Player turns, thus alleviating many of these issues (for me at least).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344034/#Comment_344034" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T12:34:23+00:00" title="September 26, 2011 12:34PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, <br/><br/>I rarely had more than 2 initial obstacles, and on at least one occasion I ended up only using one during my GM turn.

In my table the players spend a lot of Fate and Persona points. They need those little points to be successful. If you establish difficult tasks then they must do a lot of team work to be successful and use wises and throw a lot of dice. A lot of 6s come from there.<br/><br/>But you don't need house rules. You need Checks. Are the players earning enough Checks in your Turn?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>A one important source of conditions was the weather rules, which seem to fairly aggressively toss out extra conditions. Combine that with how hard it was to remove significant conditions and how incredibly frustrating that made the player turns.</blockquote>\nConditions are great. It's nice to have a mouse guard tired and thirsty and maybe angry with someone. Conditions are story hooks and motivate good performances. Anyway, I don't see this problem in my gaming experience. Two obstacles per GM's Turn, one Turn per session, three to four hours of play. Maybe one or two Conditions in the entire patrol.<br/><br/>But as jenskot said, you don't need to make the characters angry or thirsty or sick or whatever. You should to establish Twists instead. That's how the story goes somewhere. That's how interesting things happen. And remember: Conditions are not punishment. Conditions are interesting ways to move the story and the characters to new and enjoyable situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344155/#Comment_344155" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T16:09:16+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  4:09PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno...I aim for 3x hazards and a condition on every mouse before I give up my GM turn.
