There was considerable discussion of bad games diluting the market, and Ben Lehman gave an example from his own experience of being turned off to new RPG's by the experience of buying an exciting new game and discovering it to be broken.  (I'll quote him on this thread, if he gives me permission).  <br/><br/>I have had a similar experience: a few years ago, I was on a quixotic mission to collect all the crime-themed games and supplements that were easily available.  I found some neglected jewels (i.e. the Ghost Dog RPG).  I also discovered that having the "D20" logo on a product was highly correlated with that product being crap.  It's wasn't a perfect correlation, but high enough that I stopped buying D20 stuff unless it had very strong reviews.  <br/>(continues)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110968/#Comment_110968" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T14:26:47+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  2:26PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Disclaimer: I'm no economist.  I'm trying to use these terms correctly, but please feel free to chime in if I'm getting something seriously wrong.  Also, this stuff will probably be blindingly obvious to some, though it wasn't to me.<br/><br/>This seems to me to be a case of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons" rel="nofollow">Market for Lemons</a> phenomenon.  There's asymmetrical information in the market for games.  In particular, as in Ben's story, a game can have an interesting theme, setting, and attractive layout and graphics, but have lousy or actually broken rules. <br/><br/>It's hard to judge these things without a playtest, which usually is not possible without buying the game.  Even if you are able to return the game after figuring out it's a "lemon", you've still lost out because nobody will repay you for the time and energy you spent figuring out that game sucked, the opportunity cost of not playing a game you would have liked, and your lot credibility among your gaming group for "making them play that game that sucked."  Given all that, it's pretty rational to be hesitant to try a new game without some added assurances.  <br/><br/>I think this has some implications for both consumers and producers.  It's noteworthy that some of the marketing techniques that are often recommended, such as playing demos at cons and stores, being a helpful presence on the 'Net, getting some good Actual Play reports out there -- all work strongly to address the information asymmetry.  <br/><br/>This may also help explain why the indie game scene seems somewhat personality-driven -- beyond whatever cults of personality exist, people are using the famous name as a marker for quality.  It also implies that for the indie game designer, quality control is of paramount importance.  (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_quality_is_lowest_cost" rel="nofollow">this</a> for an analogous concept in manufacturing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110970/#Comment_110970" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T14:32:33+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  2:32PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Free to quote.<br/><br/>It's an interesting topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110971/#Comment_110971" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T14:33:00+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  2:33PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2007 4:16PM by DannyK.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally, I've been thinking that perhaps gaming needs a resource similar to Consumer Reports magazine.  There are plenty of outlets for reviews out there, but the reviews themselves tend to be unreliable -- with time, you can learn which reviewers are more consistent and tend to agree with your perspective, but this also takes valuable reading time.  Also, a lot of reviews seem to be generated either out of enthusiasm or dislike.  Having an outlet that would provide consistent reviews and feedback might help the field as a whole.<br/><br/>EDIT: Thinking about it, Matthijs' reviews are about as close to this idea that I've seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110972/#Comment_110972" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T14:37:04+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  2:37PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Ben.  Here's the story, and I think it shows that this is something for game producers to worry about.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>Let's see. It's Christmas of 2000. I'm an avid RPG player (I mean it, seriously, AVID) but I haven't bought a game book since ... two three years I think? Most of my games have come from used book stores, anyway. I'm not in touch with the market. I don't go to cons, I don't read about games online, I'm not in any way tied to the greater community.<br/><br/>A friend of mine buys me a new game for Christmas. (Game will not be mentioned publically). I'm like "holy shit, NEW role-playing game?" I barely knew that they still made those. The color is really cool, too. It's super-exciting. I get very jazzed up about it and decide I'm going to run a one-shot on New Year's Eve. I pre-generate the characters to my player's specifications, I make a whole little scenario that showcases the cool setting without needing the players to know the world background, I do the whole shebang.<br/><br/>New year's eve: We're playing, we're having fun, everything is great. Then ... we use the system to resolve something. Eh. It's flat and unexciting. Okay, whatever, we roll over it and keep playing and it's a good game. Then we come to a place where we need to use the extended conflict system ... and ... it doesn't work. Not as in "it doesn't give good results" it doesn't<i>work</i>. I did a back of the envelope calculation and figured out that it would have taken nearly 1000 repetitions of the resolution for it to have a decent chance of resolving. It's clear, abundantly clear, that this was never playtested. Not "never blind playtested." Not "never played in the context of a real game." But simply "the guy who wrote it never even sat down to try it out, and that was abundantly clear as soon as we did."<br/><br/>We ended up handwaving it ... but the rest of the game was just ... flat. We spent the whole time avoiding conflict and danger because we didn't want to have to think about using that system anymore. Yuck.<br/><br/>The whole experience soured me on new games. Why should I pay money for someone else's unplaytested crap? I mean, seriously, they clearly didn't even have the simplest concepts of game design, whereas I had a pretty together head about most of these things. I didn't buy any new games until Riddle of Steel in ... late 2002?<br/><br/>If the game had been good, fun, exciting, I imagine I would have been buying a lot more games. It soured me on the<i>concept</i>of new role-playing games, and it wasn't until much later that I decided to give it a shot again.<br/><br/>So there's something to that. The market can get diluted and flooded and even deflated with bad games.<br/><br/>Which is totally different from "games that you bet your life savings on." The game in question was produced in large quantities and sold through distribution. I would put Polaris up against that game in terms of making customers excited any day of the week.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110984/#Comment_110984" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T16:48:45+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  4:48PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to second  the need for a Consumer Reports-type resource.

I've gotten burned on my last few purchaces.<br/>The more crap that gets churned out, the more work for me to find something good.  Hell, the sheer volume of crap at RPGNow is daunting.  As a aspiring designer, this makes my sales go down because so much of the market is saturated with crap.  Fewer people will be willing to pick up my not-crap product, because the assumption is that my game is one of the many, many crap products out there.

They're much closer to movie DVDs or music CDs.  Or video games might be the best analogy.<br/><br/>If a game is broken, all of the copies are broken. So, one person can get hold of a copy and report the status and it's true for all copies. There is no assymetrical information here at all.<br/><br/>Unlike a Lemon Market, you <i>do</i> have the ability to assess the sale before it's made. You can talk to other people who've purchased it, or look up reviews, or arrange to get in on a game at a con or with a friend who owns it. Sellers with a high quality product do have a reliable way to get the information out there. They can hand out review copies, they organize demos. It's not like a used car where you can't tell what's a lemon or isn't, even when you're looking at two identical cars of the same model and year. Even Consumer Reports might report that the model is the best of the year. You still might end up with a car with a cracked axle or leaking oil pan.<br/><br/>And no amount of information will prevent someone who, line in Ben's case ~7 years ago, has absolutely no connection to the flow of information (information being reviews, playtests or demos at cons, discussion on the internet, whatever). There's just no cure for that except to tell the consumer that it's their job to be informed if they want a satisfactory experience (and it's pretty rude to tell someone that who just gave you it as a gift anyway). <br/><br/>But you mention that it's not always possible to get a playtest, and I'll add sometimes games don't have any reviews or any discussion. Just because you can't get reliable information on one product, doesn't mean you can't get reliable information on products in general. If you really want information, you could always try to make yourself a part of the flow by asking for a review copy.<br/><br/>Market dilution doesn't hinge on quality. And let me reiterate what I was concluding above: it does not effect the buyer in significantly negative way when they have access to fair information - which we do.<br/><br/>You could flood the market with nothing but high quality games, and the sellers would still get hurt.*<br/><br/>But buyers still have access to the same information. Whether the market is flooded with good games or bad games, if the consumer doesn't purchase until they satisfactory information, the only difference is how long it takes them to find something to purchase. Aside from time, the other threat to the consumer is it could cause a market crash. If the market is too flooded so that no one can make enough money to stay in it, then suddenly you'll have no one left in business (we actually saw this to a degree with the D20 boom and the first generation game consoles).  But then an equilibrium is reached. It might cause those with the most knowledge and experience to "get real jobs" somewhere else, so whether or not its a bad thing depends on how it recovers. Market crashes are a healthy part of the cycle. And in such an event, the downside is mostly on sellers than the buyers. The buyers just get inconvienienced.<br/><br/>I said video games would be a good analogy.  All the above can be read considering video games <i>or</i> RPGs.<br/><br/>*Unless the market grows - but if the market grows, you don't have market dilution (or at least, not as much, depending on the math).  Watchers of MMO's have been worrying about market dilution, but every game that has been released so far has increased the total size of the market overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110990/#Comment_110990" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T18:46:20+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  6:46PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That said, I do see a potential big problem of market dilution.  And one big one that's it's effectively free to publish a PDF or a Print on Demand product.  When you have to print up a product into a hard copy form, that costs money for each copy. Potential sellers are going to be wary because that's up front cost that they're going to want to see back.  Even if they don't care about a profit, there's only so much money they're going to spend on the endevour.<br/><br/>But when that bar is lowered, or even free, a seller can keep pushing out product without concern (or less concern) for the upfront costs. And if they aren't as concerned about the upfront costs (or have none outside of time), they don't have to be as concerned about recouping those costs, so there's not as much need to ensure the product is something that anyone would want to buy or enjoy.<br/><br/>Although this does strain the information path I mentioned, it doesn't make it assymetrical, it just makes it harder to get information about all the products, so it doesn't really increase your choices.<br/><br/>But if you're a seller, and are in it to make money, then it becomes difficult to break in because you have to differentiate yourself from the pack. The larger the pack is, whether or not the quality is there, the harder it is to stand out. Basically what King Turnip said in his second paragraph, except whether or not the competition is crap, it's still a dilution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110995/#Comment_110995" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T19:08:39+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  7:08PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said in the other thread, nobody sets out to make crap, but people in a rush to get stuff out make mistakes.

The only cost that is removed is the cost of printing, which, admittedly, is usually the largest chunk of the budget -- but you still have to pay writers, artists, editors, pay for delivery (if you're using a commercial service, like Lulu or RPGNow), etc.    (And that's not getting into the non-inventorial costs, like marketing, advertising, etc.)  It's not free, or even "effectively free" -- it's just cheaper.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>But when that bar is lowered, or even free, a seller can keep pushing out product without concern (or less concern) for the upfront costs.</blockquote>\nThis is also a huge factor when dealing with folks who are publishing as a hobby -- all they really care about is getting the game out there, and they're often willing to take a loss to do it.

Those that don't care about such things won't reliably subsidize them but why should they, and why should we expect them to? <br/><br/>I love shitty PDF games, if they are priced appropriately. Love 'em. I bought a $2 PDF that was clearly some guy's campaign notes and house rules for a d20 campaign, unedited, unindexed, and supplemented with art clearly scanned from his Trapper Keeper. I plundered that thing for probably thirty bucks worth of fun.  <br/><br/>That doesn't mean I won't pay a premium price for a PDF that's highly professional (print- and screen-versions, bookmarks, searchability, well-organized, indexed, edited, updated, playtested, etc.), as Gareth knows if he checks his bank account for the pile of money I have thrown at him for his cool games.<br/><br/>But discussing this without pointing out that a considerable number of gamers do not have access to a physical storefront that is run even remotely reliably, let alone one that could even conceivably be a source of unbiased information about good and bad games ignores the giant elephant taking a massive dump right on the dining room table.  I have heard that there are fine gaming stores in the world but Christ knows I've never set foot in one that wasn't eye-gougingly, nostril-scouringly awful.<br/><br/>For electronic purchases, I agree that they'd be served a lot better by a lot of reviews of all levels of professionalism, but I have no clue how to achieve this at the levels of purchases that are occurring today. I have the sinking feeling that even if the PDF market were a hundred times more robust than it is now, the review situation would never be better than Amazon reviews, and in that case, god help us.

Not to put words in his mouth, and he can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that a lot of times, Gareth is referring to a much larger phenomenon when he talks about hobbyist publishing, and gets misconstrued as referring directly to the Forge/SG/IPR crowd when he probably isn't. For example, I don't think you can look at any game at IPR and say that they're priced to sell at a loss - hell, I know quite a few people who consider most of them to be overpriced.<br/><br/>Throughout the 90's (and even some today), I remember seeing large amounts of hobbyist publishers on store shelves from people who tried to take the traditional three-tier approach because that was the only game in town, so to speak. In retrospect, now that I'm familiar with the numbers a bit more, some of those guys undoubtedly had to be doing it at a loss. And sure, few of those games are around anymore, but if you weren't White Wolf, Steve Jackson, or Rifts, or WotC later in the decade, I can see how it'd have been hard to distinguish yourself as a serious publisher in that crowd.<br/><br/>There's one game I've seen at the two conventions I've been to this year where it's clear the creators have put thousands and thousands of dollars into the production - gorgeous hardcover, large page count, amazing art and production values, huge print run, etc etc - and they have been giving crates of the book away. Just giving it to people. I don't think I've witnessed a single copy sold of that game - everyone I know who has it got it for free. <br/><br/>And it's clear there's a lot of love there, and that the people just want their game to get out there and be played. However, if you're Mob United or Adamant in the next booth over, and the average consumer doesn't know you from those guys, all they see is that over here they're giving away shit for free with smiles on, and in your booth they have to buy stuff. Their book looks just as good as yours, so what gives?<br/><br/>I mean, there's perception of value and all, but a very valid argument can be made that a lack of professional standards across the board has been and can be a damaging influence. And I don't think that has anything to do with your expected profit margin - you don't have to be in it for primary income to act like a professional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111067/#Comment_111067" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T02:35:21+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  2:35AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The anti-dilution argument seems to assume that the market is a zero sum game.

I agree with this 100%. If I look at two products, one free, the other costing real money. I would feel a little upset if the free game was better than the one I spent money to acquire. So it does raise the bar that if they want me to be happy spending money, the game should be noticeably better than I can get for free somewhere.

Publishing has now dropped to a maximally low point of entry -- nothing -- and the resulting pattern led to 2006 being terrible for some indie producers, and the establishment of the Ashcan quasi-brand through a combination of helpfulness and bullying.

I forget how many 0-sale months it takes to get a product dumped at OBS. Print is not as big a deal, but Lulu has its share of crap too. It's not one guy with infinite money to lose.

But you're right, there are a lot of costs that go on before hand and that's also something new.  Before, if I wanted to put out a game with no art, no editing besides what I did myself, poor layout, I imagine a lot of distributors would refuse it, much less public perception being poor.  But now, I could put that product out and have it sit on a virtual shelf, as Malcolm mentions, potentially forever. <br/><br/>And that's another thing consumers often forget. In the "old economy" (or whatever the hell the buzzword is) shelf space costs money. In fact, in video game publishing, <i>it's our biggest concern</i>, <i>even above reviews and game quality</i>.  But online is largely about the Long Tail, and the PDF and PoD market practically seems to be built on it. So, fans say "it's great because you can get games that focus on getting good reviews and being high quality!" but forget that you also get people who just want to see their name on the shelf more than they want anything else.<br/><br/>GMS, thanks the clarification and helping me straighten out my thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111168/#Comment_111168" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T15:11:17+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  3:11PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2007 3:15PM by noclue.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>The direct sales market is almost certainly growing, but there's a strong consensus that the total RPG market probably isn't, and there isn't strong evidence that the number of active consumers is increasing.</blockquote>\nAll true, but the economic term most suited to the indie market is "pimple on a gnat's ass." I doubt that small press sales are material enough to impact industry sales in a material way. The lack of growth in the RPG market is probably more highly correlated to the high rates of growth seen in alternative entertainment markets, such as console video games and MMORPGs. I haven't done the research, so I may be speaking out my ass, but those markets have undergone skyrocketing growth over the last ten years and, it seems to me, must be responsible for sucking more consumer dollars out of the RPG market than any 100 indie publishers with their $15 pdfs. Indie games could easily be attracting enough new gamer dollars to the industry to offset any dilutive effects they cause and you would still see declining growth in the overall market. <br/><br/>Now, I am sure that a profusion of small press games would dilute the small press game market because that market is only growing so fast, but I would definitely want to see data before I attributed dilution of consumer spending in the RPG industry at the feet of hobby game publishers. The data may point be out there, in which case I'll sit down and shut up, but this issue looks like a tempest in a teapot to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
