Specifically the talking part.<br/><br/>While doing this, I observed something interesting. The way in which the GM asks for player input has has a dramatic impact on the game. It affects how players perceive their situation and the quality level of the game as a whole. <br/><br/>As a GM, your job is to present a situation in as clear and interesting a way as you can. You then ask your players what they do as a response to the situation. <br/><br/>While I have seen an infinite variety in phrasing, I have noticed two primary ways that a GM will ask that question. The first is a variation on \u201cSo, is anyone doing anything?\u201d or \u201cSo what is everyone doing?\u201d. The second is \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d. The second is much stronger, and is the one that should be used.<br/><br/>It might seem ridiculous to focus on the wording, but it\u2019s not. The choice of words is very important. A question can imply, and it can have surprising effects on player actions. \u201cSo, is anyone doing anything?\u201d suggests some negative things about the situation, the characters, and the players themselves. In contrast \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d mandates several productive actions on the part of the players and the GM. <br/><br/>When you ask a group \u201cSo, is anyone doing anything?\u201d, you are saying that you don\u2019t know what the PCs are up too. You are not saying that you want to know what they\u2019re characters are doing, but merely that you don\u2019t know. <br/><br/>This is a dig at the players. I know, whenever someone asks me that question I feel guilty that I have not been providing enough input to the situation to allow you, as the GM, to know what my character is up too. It also suggests that the PCs might be doing nothing, which is both unbelievable, and means that your situation is boring.<br/><br/>If the PCs could ever choose \u2018nothing\u2019 as a viable response to the situation in which they find themselves, you have failed to produce a scenario anyone should care about. You should just skip whatever it is they aren\u2019t doing and move onto a scene that requires player interaction. <br/><br/>Because everyone knows that \u2018nothing\u2019 is not a viable response, and because this question is asked to the entire group, everyone will respond at the same time. <br/><br/>This kind of call to action will tend to cause the loudest and most energetic of your players to be the only people capable of action, as all potential player actions are done in the scrum following such a call for response. This kind of scrum causes those energetic players to compete with each other in order to get screen time, something that can cause friction between those players, and leads your more reserved players to disengage from play entirely and quietly fade into the background.<br/><br/>With the way that we play games online, this has the added effect of making those quiet players disappear. Because we don\u2019t have body language to help us communicate, a player who isn\u2019t talking becomes invisible. This creates a negative feedback loop of disengagement where a player's inability to act makes them less visible, which causes them to become even less able to act as the rest of the group forgets about their existence. <br/><br/>This last situation is exacerbated if your characters are in different scenes. Because of the wide-angle nature of the \u201cSo, is anyone doing anything?\u201d call for response, players can become unsure about where the camera should be going. Nobody knows where the focus of the group should fall, and so people hesitate to respond.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d is a better question. It requires active engagement, both from the GM and from the Player.<br/><br/>In order to ask that question, the context in which the characters actions take place must be clear. The GM must have provided the player with enough information to decide their next action. This tends to promote frequent context summaries from the GM. Collapsing what could be a confusing muddle of disconnected information into a focused scenario in order to permit the player to act. <br/><br/>By extension, this means that the players current situation must be known to both parties. Both the GM and the player must achieve consensus about the current situation before \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d can be answered. If a GM is not providing adequate context summaries to the player, the player will establish that context by questioning the GM. If asked \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d without adequate information, the natural response is to demand more information. \u201cWhere am I? What is going on?\u201d <br/><br/>In contrast, if asked \u201cSo, is anyone doing anything?\u201d without appropriate context, the general response is to let the other players act instead. <br/><br/>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d moves time forward. We know the current situation, so the player response defines the next thing character does. Time must advance with every call and response. Compared to \u201cSo, is anyone doing anything?\u201d it provides a steady sense of forward movement. <br/><br/>\u201cSo, is anyone doing anything?\u201d is atemporal. It requires no movement of the timeline. It is not asking where you are going, it is instead asking where you are now. It is stagnant. It contributes no forward momentum. <br/><br/>Because \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d is asked to a specific person and not to the group*, this question acts as a camera lense. It shines the groups attention on a single player at a time. This means that energetic players and reserved players can be given the same amount screen time, without having to fight for it. The GM can facilitate a more focused and more enjoyable game, while retaining the interest of all of their players, by giving each player an equal amount of attention.<br/><br/>I have found no situations where \u201cSo, is anyone doing anything? is a better question to ask then \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d. I am going to make a conscious effort to never ask that question in a game ever again. <br/><br/>Has anyone else noticed patterns in how the specific phrasing affects play?<br/><br/><br/>* English is ambiguous in it\u2019s use of the word \u201cyou\u201d but I choose to interpret \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d as meaning \u201cWhat do you do (Singular Person)?\u201d as opposed to \u201cWhat do you (all) do (as a group)?\u201d                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407840/#Comment_407840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T22:30:18+00:00" title="March  2, 2013 10:30PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find the easiest thing to do, whether I'm a player that's called a GM or not, is to use people's names.

I like to play roleplaying games like conversations, and like conversations there should be a nice flow in how one speaks and then hands it over to another person. A conversation ends in two ways, either it dies out because it doesn't have a goal or it comes to a stop when everybody has reached a conclusion. A natural way for a conversation to live on it to make it mutate and be about something else instead.<br/><br/>So to make a roleplaying session live you need to:<ul><li>Give the players a goal - something to strive for.</li>\n<li>Create new situations when the story comes to a halt.</li>\n<li>Have tools to make the story mutate over time.</li></ul>\n"What do you do?" may seem like an easy way to hand it over to the players - "It's your turn to talk" - but it may also be used to rail the players. To say "You see something in the corner. What do you do?" is equivalent to say "I want you to investigate the corner". Why don't you just tell what's in the corner to see how the player reacts? To me, the question "What do you do?" is a lazy man's tool to make the players active. Instead of asking that question, you should ask <i>yourself </i>what you can use to activate the players.<br/><br/>One of the GM's obligations is to make the players active, and another is to provide information. To little information and the players can't do anything. To much information and you render the players inactive because they need to sit and listen to you. Throw things at them and see how they react. Use their goals as guidelines for what you should throw. Note that there can be long term goals - "I want to own a space ship" - and short term goals - "I want to find information in this room". So what's in the corner that can satisfy either goal?<br/><br/>One thing I tend to do is to break off the session with a discussion with the players. I recap what hooked them, I repeat the information that I've been given them, I ask questions to make them look at some of the information from a different perspective and I ask them what their plans are in the future. The last question may seem like "What do you do?" but I ask that to create (new) goals for the players. To see if they want to stay at their original goal or if they want to take a new direction. Perhaps the religious people that they work for actually are a doomsday cult. How will that information change their goals?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407872/#Comment_407872" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-03T11:04:10+00:00" title="March  3, 2013 11:04AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, <br/><br/>I find myself disagreeing with you Rickard, but that may be because I play only online over Skype. In a physical conversation body language can handle a lot of what the directed questions I'm talking about do in online games.<br/><br/>Without a way to communicate focus non vocally, such as by eye contact and body orientation (if you want a player to act, looking at them lets everyone know where your focus is), you have to rely on words. <br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've played in person, but I think I'd still end up asking the question anyways.

The question is still a conversational cue. The example looks fine at first glance, but what I see is a GM that haven't laid down the ground work. I would say a better way would be to say, "Wizard, you see how the ranger is pushed back by the blow and end up balancing on the edge, and it's now your turn to act". Do you see? The last part is a conversational cue, just as the question.<br/><br/>But I want to take a step back. The ground work would be in an earlier state to present a structure for the conversation, so it's more obvious for the players when to take over. You say the GM ask because it's obvious that the Wizard is going to do something, but if that's the case, you wouldn't need to ask the question. If you got an initiative system, pacing mechanism, or just talked about how to handle the conversation and describes the opponents turn to the wizard, the passing of the talking stick is (read: could be) more obvious. You present a situation and wants to see how the player reacts to it. It's totally OK if the player doesn't respond to it. Then it's up to you to create a new situation or make the existing one mutate. Sooner or later the player will be hooked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
