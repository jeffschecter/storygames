Overall, the game went pretty smoothly, and I came away with a few wonderings. I haven't seen any other discussions about these questions, and apologies if these have been talked about before here or elsewhere.<br/><br/>1. What are the thresholds for Abundance, Scarcity, and the irrelevant in-between? How do you know the status of a Resource changed aside from "because I say so"?<br/><i>Example: Say you have a Scarcity of food. Should you expect to make that go away as a result of completing just one project that provides food? And when you do get rid of a Scarcity of food, what would then make it Abundant?</i><br/><br/>2. When you take a Contempt Token because you weren't consulted, who is the "you" that takes it? The player? The interested community representative? The dispassionate scientist conducting a social experiment?<br/><br/>3. Contempt seems to do two things: didactically it reminds players that disagreement is expected in communities, and narratively it gives players information about community relations on which to build a story. Is this right? Is Contempt doing something else?<br/><br/>4.

And when you do get rid of a Scarcity of food, what would then make it Abundant?</blockquote>\nAs far as I can tell, Scarcities are almost the entire reason the community undertakes projects. For me the test is this: when you started the project, did you intend to make it not scarce or to make it abundant? If so, no one can argue with you. In fact, you can rocket right from Scarcity to Abundance if you really feel like the community would have done that. There aren't thresholds, there's just what feels right. If you're concerned about it, ask when you start the project so people can calculate that into their time estimates.\n<blockquote>2. When you take a Contempt Token because you weren't consulted, who is the "you" that takes it? The player? The interested community representative? The dispassionate scientist conducting a social experiment?</blockquote>\nShort answer: yes. As with most things in this game, you can use any rationale you like, especially in this situation because it's Your Little Secret. I think in most cases it's most natural to do so at your own personal reaction, since hey, if that's your opinion probably there's someone in the community that feels the same way. If it bothers you to be inconsistent about it, maybe just decide ahead of time what it's going to mean if you take Contempt?\n<blockquote>3. Contempt seems to do two things: didactically it reminds players that disagreement is expected in communities, and narratively it gives players information about community relations on which to build a story. Is this right? Is Contempt doing something else?</blockquote>\nI'll most definitely defer to Mcdaldno on this one, but I think you've got it right. Although there's also a meta element to it that I'm finding hard to wrap words around. I'll leave that for someone else.\n<blockquote>4. Is it possible to take Contempt as a result of Holding a Discussion?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely. If all the other parts of your community oppose the views of the part you represent, I'd say that totally qualifies for Contempt.<br/><br/>(Mcdaldno, please correct me if I got any of that wrong.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399906/#Comment_399906" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T00:22:14+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 12:22AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Thresholds for Abundances and Scarcities</b><br/><br/>There are no concrete thresholds. If you have a Scarcity of food, a single project might or might not alleviate that Scarcity. Ask yourself: is this going to keep us reasonably well-fed for months? Do we still feel the fear and weight of not having enough? If you have a project to harvest and pickle all the beets and turnips, but that only produces enough food to reliably feed your community for about three weeks, then maybe you still have a Scarcity - but also a temporary reprieve from it (no alteration to the card).<br/><br/>Different groups will have different emergent criterion for how serious a Scarcity/Abundance is. It's fine to ask "So, does this alleviate our Scarcity?" and to accept whatever answer is given.<br/><br/><b>Who Takes Contempt?</b><br/><br/>Take Contempt on behalf of voices within the community.<br/><br/>The "threshold" for what deserves Contempt will vary between groups (just like the "threshold" for what counts as a Scarcity or Abundance will). In some games, you'll only see 1-2 Contempt taken per player across the whole year. In other games, you'll see 4-6 taken.<br/><br/><b>What Does Contempt Represent?</b><br/><br/>You nailed it.<br/><br/><b>Taking Contempt During Discussions</b><br/><br/>You can theoretically take Contempt during a conversation. Don't do this when people disagree with you, but only when you feel that you were not honoured or not heard (the regular Contempt guidelines).<br/><br/>For example, if I asked, "What should we do about the rainwalkers?" and people responded by continuing to talk about the need to fortify our encampment (off topic!), I might take a Contempt because I felt unheard. If someone used their discussion weigh-in to attack a "faction" I'd previously spoken as, in a way that prioritized hostility over engagement, I might take a Contempt because I felt dishonored.\n<blockquote>Absolutely. If all the other parts of your community oppose the views of the part you represent, I'd say that totally qualifies for Contempt.</blockquote>\nHere, I would quibble. That situation only qualifies for Contempt if you felt like your voice wasn't heard or wasn't honored. Everyone disagreeing with you? That doesn't mean that you weren't heard. (But then again, it's also very likely that it <i>could</i> mean that.)<br/><br/>Now if everyone else were to agree about needing to explore the haunted skyscraper, and you were insisting that it was a dangerous idea that should be avoided... if the next action were to be a 3-week project of exploring the skyscraper, then that <i>certainly</i> sounds like a Contempt-worthy situation (so long as it left you feeling not heard or not honored).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thetravatar" title="thetravatar"><img alt="thetravatar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thetravatar">thetravatar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399943/#Comment_399943" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T08:08:41+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  8:08AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, both of you for your thoughts! I feel like a lot of my questions are due to having only played the game once, and that further plays would help clarify some of it. At the same time, I'm craving more examples. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On Resources</span>: I have a further question, which I think is about resources, focus, and the flow of the narrative. In last night's game, there were often projects cropping up to deal with Scarcities straightaway. We're diseased, so we build an infirmary right away. A few turns later, we're no longer diseased. I felt like this approach undercut all Scarcity, because every time a problem cropped up, we could just wait a few weeks and it's all fixed.<br/><br/>Similarly Discovering Something New: There was no time pressure about the barbarians waiting out there, which made them (and other threats) feel kind of toothless. Is this just a matter of this particular instance of the game being unfocused by introducing too much new business before old business was settled? <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On Taking Contempt</span>: So, in last night's game, I was generally on the side of the Hill People (because screw those exclusionary Potato people!). But I and the other two players were sometimes taking Contempt tokens on behalf of other factions. It feels a little weird in this case to take Contempt on behalf of both sides, depending on which one someone is championing on any given turn. Is it supposed to feel weird, or am I missing something?<br/><br/>I want to add that I really love the contrast between the harshness implied by Contempt Tokens and how they're taken alongside the gentleness with which the facilitator is told to handle rules challenges. It's smart and wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
