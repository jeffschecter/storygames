I need to work out some things before the next session, and I thought it would be helpful to see what ideas the creative and experienced gamers on these forums had. To be clear, I'm pretty confident I can run an okay session with just my own ideas, so no need to plough through this altruistically if you don't want to. But if you get a kick out of GMing (and who doesn't?) feel free to contribute!<br/><br/><b>Recap</b><br/>So here is what has happened: Most of the goblins living in the ruined monastery fled when the players unleashed the animated iron statue of the High Priest, but when the players returned with a plan to deal with the statue, they met Ketran, goblin shaman and her band of 5 loyalists who had remained camped nearby. They entered into an alliance to defeat the statue, but once this was accomplished Ketran betrayed them and tried of make off with the High Priest's book of necromancy. They killed her and got the book back, but four goblins escaped and have run off to (presumably) alert the rest of the goblins.<br/><br/>The players have gone back to town and made a speech to rally the townsfolk to chase down the goblins and rid the land of these raiders - one of their hirelings, Gertrude, died at the hands of the goblins, and she's from this town, so this was a flashpoint on to of the recent raiding of farmsteads. About 20 people pledged to join the posse the following morning.<br/><br/><b>Setup for next session</b><br/>So next time we play this party, they will be tracking down the goblins and then, assuming we find them, they will be fighting them. None of this is preplanned; I don't have details of the landscape hereabouts, other than it is hilly sheep-farming country (my main point of reference is the Lake District in England, but it could drift). The "goblins" are more or less humans from a different culture - a more tribal and less technologically advanced culture, with a different religion - although they do seem to have the ability to see without light. There are about 20 goblins, plus the four who have fled towards the main band.<br/><br/><b>Questions</b><br/>I'm keen to generally hear ideas both fictional and procedural regarding any of this. e.g. tracking, the posse (morale, conflicting leadership), large scale combat, other things encountered along the way. But the biggest question on my mind at the moment is the terrain.<br/><br/>I feel like that in order to properly deal with the fictional concerns of how the goblins act I need to design terrain first, then decide what the goblins have done so far, then run the simulation forwards (of both goblin and player actions) as the players explore. If I design from the goblins' actions first and then create the terrain around that I think I will lose the impartiality of the sandbox setting. Equally, I can't just improvise the terrain, because then I can't have made in-fiction decisions about where the goblins are. Do you agree?<br/><br/>If you do, how do you think I should map things out? My hexmap so far is ~6 mile hexes, and the current hex has two known locations: the town of Waleburg and the monastery which has been established as about 3 miles to the north. Do you think I should use a smaller scale hexmap or some other kind of map? What scale? What features should I be noting?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442864/#Comment_442864" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T17:16:16+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  5:16PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Tomb has something of an iconic reputation around here - I conducted it in I think 2008 or so, and since then it's become a popular cornerstone for beginning sandboxes of the various people who it has been inflicted upon; practically everybody has played it. Nice to see that you've had fun with it as well <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Your setup is rather similar to the metatrends around here - historical fantasy, goblins are indigenous primitives more than magical/jocular fairy tale beings, etc. Similar on/off alliances and relationships with the goblin tribe in the tomb have been a typical development with us as well.<br/><br/>Regarding the general technical approach to the situation, I usually run this sort of thing on the 6 mile hex map and improvise local terrain on smaller scales. I've occasionally also used a 1-mile subscale, but that's entirely optional and a more advanced technique that's only worth it if you know that there'll be ample content at that scale. For a posse hunting some goblins I probably would not bother with more detailed mapping.<br/><br/>As for how to establish terrain without previous hex-mapping on the appropriate scale, I tend to use stochastic teleology of sorts: the operating party who care about terrain ask the referee for their preferred terrain, the referee determines the probability of finding the terrain they want in the current hex, and dice are rolled - potentially against some sort of local lore or woodscraft ability, if such are in use. For example, in this particular case we could ask whether the goblins might have found a cave of sort to live in while they're figuring out what to do next; the referee would assign a probability (maybe 1/6 because habitable caves are rare in this hex/area) and resolve; if the goblins couldn't find a cave, we find out what would be their second-most favoured terrain. This way we find out what the immediate camping site of the goblins looks like without having to map the entire area and figure out where the goblins would choose to go.<br/><br/>Later, when the posse is hunting the goblins, I would describe terrain according to the general nature of the hex, improvising wildly upon the natural world. They'd maybe make some search rolls or whatever, although if they have no particular idea of how to find the goblins, it would be essentially up to local knowledge (e.g. figuring out where the goblins would go for potable water, or knowing about a likely cave that the goblins would want to use as a temporary base) and luck. Assuming their persistence and luck holds out, they'll maybe find the goblins at some point, or potentially they find something else if there is something interesting to be found. Because I would not be using subhexes to track movement within a hex, I'd need to use dice rolls to determine whether the posse stumbles upon the goblins or not.<br/><br/>As an example, the last time I GMed a semi-random search like this - this was Basic D&amp;D more or less, and the party was looking for the waters of life in a thickly wooded area - my procedure was as follows: 1/6 random encounter check at every entry to a new hex and another one every 12 hours spent in a single hex (starting ~4 hours after arrival); each random encounter would have a 50% chance of being with the thing being sought (otherwise normal determination); each search party within a hex would get a single search check (1/6, bonuses for Wis mods and whatever) for each time span spent searching (length of time span depending on terrain, e.g. 4 hours); a successful search check would have a 1/6 chance of being a discovery of something else, otherwise it's a discovery of the thing being sought at the moment.<br/><br/>So you can see how instead of mapping the area on a 1-mile level or even 1,000 feet level subhexes, I merely kept track of time, difficulty of search terrain, possibility of random encounter friction messing with the search, and the persistence and search choices of the players - they'd obviously get bonus checks or better chances on the search checks if they could formulate a search strategy with more sense to it than just peeking under every rock randomly. Of course, while I didn't have any particular opinion about whether the target of the search was in this or that part of the hex, I certainly knew in which hex it was, and thus the search was futile until the party actually got into the correct hex.<br/><br/>The idea in this approach is not to "fake" anything per se; rather, it's about preserving unnecessary GM work to better focus on providing opportunities for making actual strategic and tactical choices. In some ways a detailed terrain map of the individual ridgelines, streams and gullies of a single hex is quite a bit of work for the sake of letting the players declare that they will continue the search in a random direction, keeping their eyes open while they move. Might as well improvise the details and let the players draw a map if they want to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442865/#Comment_442865" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T17:18:19+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  5:18PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few more random points. This is a somewhat inchoate topic, essentially encompassing the entirety of wilderness hex crawl procedure in combination with active counter-force operations by enemies in a fog of war situation, which makes it a pretty expansive subject matter. I'll just make a few more random points for now, to inspire your grey matter...<br/><br/><b>Goblin actions</b><br/><br/>The goblins will need water, food, shelter from the elements. They might or might not have leadership issues with the shaman gone. They will have to decide whether they are abandoning their home, or going back.<br/><br/>The goblins are probably not an entirely isolated tribe, and if they have human-like material and social preconditions of existence, it is likely that they have relatively fair relations with other goblin tribes in the area, at least compared to their relationship with the agriculturalist "humans". All this means that it is not unlikely that the goblins have kin in other tribes within a few days journey of their home area. This is good to remember in this type of existential conflict, as the goblins have both an escalation strategy and an exit strategy for this sort of local warfare: on the one hand they could try to form a temporary war crew with other tribes to overrun their enemy with the combined strength several tribes, and on the other hand they could disband their tribe if the pressure from the whitey proves untenable - everybody scatters and joins the tribal units of their distant kin in the region, begging them to take their stray kinsmen into their group.<br/><br/><b>Concurrent activities in a fog of war</b><br/><br/>You mention running a real-time simulation of the actions of the goblins. I have found that often I don't have time to do anything too complex in this regard while GMing, which is why I rely on stochastic methods in this as well. So instead of figuring out what the goblins are doing step in step with the adventurers, you could instead query yourself on whether the goblins could possibly have done something relevant to what the PCs are doing, every time the PCs make a move. This way you only need to worry about the goblins when they become potentially relevant, not before.<br/><br/>For example, in this case you can make random encounter checks and such to establish whether the goblins (a scouting patrol or the entire remainder of the tribe) and the posse run into each other in the woods by accident. When the posse finds the goblin encampment, you can look at the time and roll for whether the goblins have already abandoned their camp to continue doing whatever it is they decided to do next; the sooner the camp is found, the likelier it is that the goblins are still there, debating what to do or preparing to leave or whatever. So you decide what's up with the goblins when the PCs stumble upon them, and not sooner.<br/><br/>Obviously this approach makes more sense if you don't have that detailed subhex terrain simulation. If you do, then you might as well keep track of which subhex the goblins are in, exactly, and move them about as time passes. Even in that case I think you'll find it useful to do "just in time" processing instead of trying to decide on the goblin movements step in step with the PCs. It's just faster to decide on what the goblins will be doing for the next 10 hours - or what they've been doing for the last 10 for that matter - than it is to decide on their activities as often as the PCs do on theirs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442867/#Comment_442867" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T17:27:50+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  5:27PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eero, that's helpful stuff as usual. I have a pretty good idea of the goblins' internal politics, and their access to others of their kin (the group are a raiding band a fair way from home, the shaman was a counter-balancing force to the war-leader who is now more  dominant).<br/><br/>One thing that I hadn't made clear is that the party are presumably starting from following the tracks they abandoned the previous evening - the weather was rolled to be clear and dry, so the tracks shouldn't be too degraded. So their search won't be entirely random, and I was thinking along the lines of ambush spots for the goblins, etc., but then I wanted to allow the players the opportunity to tactically avoid that.

Making a detailed map before the game and working from that certainly *can* be a god approach, if you see enough benefit from a detailed working-out of this situation (e.g. it will take longer than just a quick play-through). <br/><br/>2. I'm fond of making a quick internal model of the goblins' politics (e.g. the shaman wants to attack the village immediately, whereas the war-leader argues to retreat and gather more forces), and then basically using conflict resolution mechanics to figure out what happens.<br/><br/>Maybe every "turn" (however you define that here), I roll for their debate, and as soon as one side has a clear victory (perhaps a certain margin is achieved), the goblins go into action. If the shaman won, then they move towards the village. If the war-leader won, then they retreat or send out scouts to alert allies, or whatever else. (I'd roll dice to see which strategy they take if multiple strategies are possible.)<br/><br/>In this case, it's possible to use a deterministic approach (their camp is *here*, so each turn they move one hex towards the village, until they reach it), or a random approach (1-in-6 chance each turn of them reaching the village), whichever seems like more fun to you.<br/><br/>3. It can be great fun to ask yourself simple yes-or-no questions and roll for the answer each time. A high die result means "yes"; a low result means "no".<br/><br/>* Are the goblins preparing an ambush? -&gt; Yes.<br/>* Is it hastily prepared? -&gt; No.<br/>* Are they using any special, brilliant tactics? -&gt; No.<br/>* [Players approach a likely ambush spot] Are they hiding at the top of the cliff? -&gt; Yes.<br/>Etc.<br/><br/>In this way, you discover the situation for yourself. I make the rolls while the players are deliberating their next course of action, and I don't have anything else to do. My musings turn into questions, and dice rolls turn them into realities (or not, as the dice say).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442869/#Comment_442869" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T18:33:29+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  6:33PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I'd do that situation would probably be something like this:<br/><br/>The party is following the tracks (successfully, we'll assume - although I tend to consider following tracks to be a relatively difficult feat, all things being equal), and there might or might not be ambushes on the way. The first thing I do is, I wait to see if the players address the possibility of ambush by any preparations; for example, the militarily competent standard practice would be to use "advance scouts" to discover or trigger ambushes.<br/><br/>(If the players do not address this matter, I might have characters with appropriate skills or backgrounds roll idea rolls, and if they are successful, I remind them about the issue. I do this a lot - I participate in tactical planning with the players, but tend to filter my input through NPCs or skill checks to make it "lumpy" and non-trivial.)<br/><br/>Once we have a good understanding of how the posse is advancing, I find out whether there actually are ambushes present. (Randomize it somehow, perhaps, or whatever.) Whether there are or not, I'll probably have some ability checks or such to find out whether the scouts or the posse recognize a potentially dangerous ambush spot as they approach one - bonuses or auto-success for players who explicitly declare they're looking for such, of course. Depending on the terrain such ambush spots might be ubiquitous or rare; in the former case only heavy advance scouting will make it possible to pre-empt all possibilities, while in the latter it's possible for just one or two scouts to climb all the hills and check all the bushes for potential ambush.<br/><br/>All this will end up with either the party traveling safely and ignorant of ambushes, or party traveling safely while checking for ambushes conscientiously, or they'll walk into an ambush due to failure of scouting or failure to scout at all, or they'll discover an ambush in advance - either simultaneous alarm or they make silent discovery, in which case there's an opportunity for counter-ambush. The goblins are probably pretty good in this stuff, so a smart posse will put some thought into how to avoid a goblin ambush while following a goblin trail.<br/><br/>As you can see, I'd pretty much go with skill checks and such to speed up progress. Of course I would also give concrete examples about what I mean when I discuss "potential ambush locations" and "committed scouting resources" and so on - the players need to be able to visualize how the mechanical process goes to enjoy it, so they need to understand that when their characters are "scouting" that means traveling ahead of the main posse and ensuring that there are no enemies hiding in possible attack venues near the trail. In hilly sheep-herding country I'd probably talk of hilltops cutting line of sight (requiring somebody to ride around to check for enemies hiding behind the hill), of crags and large rocks, and of cops of woods and high underbush; a horse would be ideal equipment for an advance scout in this terrain. A well-prepped ambush could involve men digging themselves under the turf hours in advance of the enemy approaching, but perhaps the goblins aren't quite so certain about the posse coming after them <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>So yeah, I would describe the terrain in general terms, and in terms of examples of specific formations that are passed, but I wouldn't prepare detailed geography in advance - all this stuff is just passing scenery until it is actually established that there is an ambush or other random encounter, at which point I can provide the specific terrain for the moment when the problem actually occurs. I could even prepare that terrain in advance if I subscribed to some sort of 4th edition style encounter design paradigm, where the environment of each fight needs to be particularly special and exciting <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442871/#Comment_442871" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T18:41:46+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  6:41PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

This ensures that "likely" things occur more often in your world than "unlikely" things, and the more "unlikely" something is, the less often it will be true.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442902/#Comment_442902" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T17:54:59+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  5:54PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2015 5:56PM by MartinEden.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of good procedures here. Thank you. The reason that pre-generated maps were on my mind is that we have run into some slightly sticky play recently. Let me try and explain.<br/><br/>When the party first arrived at the ruins they ventured a short way in and then decided to make camp. I rolled randomly to determine how close was the nearest reasonable camp-site (moderately defensible, sheltered from the wind) and it was 10 minutes walk away.<br/><br/>Later, the party abandoned that camp-site (there was the matter of the unfortunate death of some pilgrims at the hands of a zombie that the party failed to prevent). They then asked for another camp-site. This one, I said, wasn't so defensible and it was 20 minutes away. This was about as much detail as we defined at this point - not even the direction from the ruin to the camp-site was specified.<br/><br/>Later still, the party approached the ruin again, and this time they were observed by Ketran (the goblin Shaman) from her camp-site higher up on a hill about a mile away (30 minutes walk by the rough rules we're using). At this point, I determined (not randomly, just coming up with stuff) that the original camp-site had been North-West of the ruin, the second one West (actually this had been established previously - I remember describing the shadows of their hillock playing across the ruins as the sun set behind them) and Ketran's camp-site was South.<br/><br/>Later, some of the party left the ruin with Ketran to go to her camp-site. She went from it to the nearby stream that I determined was a short walk (5 minutes) from her camp-site. I determined that part of the stream was out of sight of the camp-site on the ridge of the hill. <br/><br/>Shortly after, combat was joined, and it was established that though the events by the stream were hidden from the hill-top, the goblin there *could* see Ketran sprinting for her life back towards the ruins. At which point, one of the players protested that they hadn't realized that this would be visible to the goblin on the hill.<br/><br/>Now, a certain degree of miscommunication of the situation in the referee's head does happen. It's the nature of the game, and we have procedures for fairly resolving things  and moving on when things have gotten confused. And the other players, including the one whose character was present, were not fussed. Still, it wasn't great.<br/><br/>We had a similar snag a bit later when the players were fleeing from the now blood-thirsty goblins in the ruins, although I won't go into that here.<br/><br/>All this is to illustrate my current concern: If you begin with these kind of vague "just-in-time" details, but then keep layering more and more of them on to a single area, at some point they need to resolve into coherent geography, and they need to do it a way that doesn't confuse the players. It was fresh from this experience that I had the knee-jerk reaction to go all the way to a pre-planned map. What suggestions do you have for managing this transition from functional geography ("yes, there is an X within such and such distance") to tactical placement and cartography? Or is the problem here just lack of descriptive skill on my part? Or the players' fault for not sanity-checking their plans against the referee?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442912/#Comment_442912" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T20:23:07+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  8:23PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That issue you describe isn't so much about procedures, which seem just fine to me. Rather, it's about the creative roles of the participants, and the attitudes they bring with them: a player who feels like the GM has wronged them or made a mistake when personal imaginations about vaguely established fiction clash is perhaps approaching that element of the game with more adversiality than would be necessary. The group should get in the habit of accepting clarifying discussions about the fiction as a matter of form, not as some sort of catastrophe that should be somebody's fault and that would never happen if somebody didn't make a mistake. It is a necessary part of effective play, you can't choke the process for the sake of ensuring that everybody's always imagining every nitpicky detail in the same way.<br/><br/>The way we routinely get over that confusing hump at my table is with extremely egalitarian negotiation. Like, if a player protested about unestablished visibility, the first question would be whether that would have mattered, and should the characters have noticed it. Then we assign a judgement (it matters, but the character failed to pay attention; it doesn't matter; it matters, and the character should get a retroactive wits ability check to see if they get some compensation; it matters, and the players get a do-over, because the GM was at fault for not being clearer) and move on, no big deal. The vast majority of the time the players accept that the fact that they didn't stop to pre-establish something about the fiction means that their character didn't really pay attention to that detail before it was too late. After all, if the character thought that matter important, the player would've asked about it before executing their plan.<br/><br/>Note that most of the time the appropriate redress for a mistake in establishing the fiction is a GM apology rather than something so drastically disruptive as a "do-over". I personally prefer to skip the entire situation rather than replaying something, in fact, and will regularly suggest e.g. that play continue on with the hurt character getting half their HP back to recompense for a ham-fisted GM play. An apology should work most of the time, though; what else really needs to be said, except that I could probably have been more clear about this, sorry about that and lets do better in the future.<br/><br/>(Players get to apologize much less because of how their role is construed; usually the player's fault is not paying attention or not thinking to ask the right questions. These are not faults to apologize for, as the player is only hurting themselves with these mistakes.)<br/><br/>So yeah, I'd say that what you have here is a learning curve for the whole group, and not a reason for revising your methodology - unless of course the group as a whole wants such revision, to develop something that works for your unique conditions. Once the players stop assigning blame to the GM with a presumption of privilege ("The fiction was vague and that is automatically the GM's fault, not mine"), they'll start taking more responsibility themselves for the group being on the same page about the fictional details, and that then leads to a generally smoother flow of the game.<br/><br/>I believe that you already know this, but just in case: remember that when the group's understanding about some fictional detail only mentioned in passing or left implicit differs, it is not necessarily the GM who is automatically in the right, despite them probably having paid the most attention to the fictional space. Rather, as a referee you should always keep your eye on the prize in these clarification negotiations: will the group benefit by improving the challenge and resolution process by giving in, or by sticking to your own picture? That's really all that matters. If the players honestly imagined something differently, and their imagination is just as good for the agenda as yours, or even better, then there's no reason to not be the one who gives in. On the other hand, you should not give anybody the impression that it is a legitimate move in the game to attempt to win by manipulating the consensus process: just about the only reason to let somebody get out of trouble with a procedure call is that they're a newbie and need the break to get their feet under them; in all other situations it is important that the players learn to cherish the sportsmanship of taking what's coming to them instead of whining like little babies in the hopes of getting candy from the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
