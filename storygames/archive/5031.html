As such, the Guild will be opening a retail store in early 08. In the planning for this new style of store, we've been looking for any many synergies as we can find when blending the printing and binding capacities with games and thing gamers might like. A thought that struck me today is, one service our store could officer was print-on-demand art prints.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am thinking is the store could sell art prints both online and in its B&amp;M location/s. In store we would have an area with signage for this service and then have all the artwork that is available in binders, sorted by genre and artist, for customers to flip through.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could print B&amp;W and Color art prints and can print them onto a nice glossy stock and have an upgraded version where we laminate them. So basically, we would have 8 product options for each piece of artwork, unless, for some reason, an artist didn't want the piece to be available for all of them. What I need to figure out is what would be fair pricing for:<br/>\n<br/>\nB&amp;W Artwork. 8.5" x 11" on glossy cover stock<br/>\nB&amp;W Artwork. 8.5" x 11" on glossy cover stock. laminated (3mil lamination)<br/>\nB&amp;W Artwork. 11" x 17" on glossy cover stock<br/>\nB&amp;W Artwork. 11" x 17" on glossy cover stock. laminated (3mil lamination)<br/>\nColor Artwork. 8.5" x 11" on glossy cover stock<br/>\nColor Artwork. 8.5" x 11" on glossy cover stock. laminated (3mil lamination)<br/>\nColor Artwork. 11" x 17" on glossy cover stock<br/>\nColor Artwork. 11" x 17" on glossy cover stock. laminated (3mil lamination)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese would be POD (produced to order). Artists interested in having art pieces available for this service would grant us a non exclusive license to print and sell the art pieces, restricted to our online store for the service and through Guild of Blades retail outlets. Commissions would be paid to the artists as sales happened and I'm guessing a commission split between 15-35%. I don't have a hard and fixed number in mind for this, but it would basically depend on what were the realistic retail prices for the art prints.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what could art prints sell for? I don't want to get into the mess of having different contracts with different artists. There would be a single contract with a single commission rate and a single set of retail pricing based on the finished format for the print. Or in other words, we would charge a customer the same amount for an Elmore as a somewhat unknown artist. Now, this might mean artists of Elmore's stature might not find it a worthwhile venue for them. I don't know. I just know logistically, this is the only way I can see it working for us on the retail end. In the grand scheme of things, it would be just one small revenue stream among many on the retail end. Having never offered this kind of product (art prints) for sale before, I really can't judge how much business it could draw, online or through the B&amp;M locations. Though I think it is a unique product that we can offer at retail, so its worth doing so we can all find its potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expect those artists that were interested could probably let us list their e-mail addresses or phone numbers for those customers who loved their works and were interested in contacting them for commissioned works. Probably website contact info would be an option for those artists that didn't also offer their own art prints for sales via that site/page.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, all feedback on this idea is welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRyan S.

I don't see what the artist has to lose, given that once they give a piece to the client, they usually don't see anymore use out of it except as part of a portfolio. That it could continue to pay out is a nice bonus. Seems like you could sell prints for around $10-$25 if you wanted to make them attractive. I mean they are prints, after all, and not originals. <br/><br/>You should probably bear in mind that not every illustration is going to look good blown up to 11 x 14. Most art is done bigger with the intention of seeing it shrunk down for print, so increasing the size isn't usually the artist's intention. It doesn't always work both ways. At the very least, you'll probably have to make sure your file sizes and resolutions are up to snuff here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113518/#Comment_113518" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T08:38:42+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  8:38AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about POD posters as well?

I got some test samples printed on the floor model of the new laser printer we intend to buy. The print quality is most excellent and I found it can print on the 12pt cover stock weight paper no problem. I also saw a live sample of the computerized die cutter we would be using to cut the cards out and saw that it will function to meet our needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo POD cards will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I noticed an odd resizing issue when I printed the cards. And the back sides to the cards we printed ended up being consistently 10-15% lighter than the first side printed (whichever side we printed 2nd...didn't matter). I'm sure the resizing issue is simply a border related issue and the sales rep just didn't set the printer up right, but this does mean I as of yet don't know the exact layout to tell people for laying out their cards. The fading issue on the paper I did the test prints on was likely a trait of the heavy photo finish on both sides of the paper. When I have the machine delivered I'll be able to test out another stock or two to see if they have the same problems or not. We're intentionally using high gloss cover stocks so that the cards and the printing have a very crisp and shinny look since we are unable to apply a laminate post printing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, we'll begin build out of the store in late January and once we are into that space we'll have the new machines delivered there. At that time I will be able to work with the machines myself and answer the last of these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I can tell you that we'll have packaging solutions for single deck tuck boxes with printing directly onto the box, double deck tuck boxes with room enough for dice and some game rules with a color wrap that gets attached around a blank white box, and for smaller card expansions, we'll be able to do a die cut printed packet that the cards get set inside and then the packets folds around the cards. That would be about the size of a "booster pack", but instead of foil packaging, it would have a a case wrapping printed onto a 12pt cover stock and die cut.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be putting up some web pages to detail some of the services we'll be offering and should have them complete before the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

The largest sheet size our laser printer will be able to handle is a 12" x 18" and that would not be full bleed printing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in theory, we could print a multi-part poster. We've previously printed and laminated signage and posters for our first store by simply printing multiple 11x17 sheets and taping them together. The printing in that case is the easy part. The difficult part is the cutting off of the white edges without cutting artwork and then successfully combining the pieces. That and the person chopping up the larger original artwork has to be very precise in making the pieces equally sized and to fit the sheet print size.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

These are prints, not originals, so it's like a poster essentially. Does a poster for ''Godfather'' cost more than a poster for ''Waterworld''(it probably does by now, but you get the idea).<br/><br/>If you offer good prices and promote it well, I think alot of artists will be interested.

We will offer the following art prints and related products in the store initially. If there proves to be any local interest in the service whatsoever, we will likely then move forward to offer the same services online.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.5" x 11" B&amp;W Art Print. $2.99<br/>\n11" x 17" B&amp;W Art Print. $4.99<br/>\n8.5" x 11" Color Art Print. $4.99<br/>\n11" x 17" Color Art Print. $6.99<br/>\nBookmark $1.50<br/>\nCustom Greeting Card $5.99<br/>\nCustom Book Dust Jacket $9.99<br/>\n<br/>\nFor art prints we will pay artists a 20% commission. We will only be able to work with artists that have a Paypal account set up, or who are willing to wait until they have earned $100 in commissions to receive a check payment. For artists with Paypal we will pay out as early as $10 in commissions earned, but if an artist would prefer to wait until a higher amount is generated, we will let them set their pay out level.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor bookmarks, custom greeting cards and custom dusk jackets, we will pay a 10% commission. Logic being there is a bit of layout design work and customer hand holding on our end to get that product ready for sale.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe contract for this would grant us a non exclusive license to reproduce and sell the artwork for the above items. Artists would be able to terminate the contract at-will, excepting that for each piece of artwork submitted under the service, we would retain the right to reproduce it for use with the service until that piece of artwork had generated at least $10 in commissions for the artist. So after receiving notice of termination, we would retain the right to use the artwork for this service until commissions of $10 had been earned, at which time our rights would cease. This clause is a safety net allowing an art piece to earn out the minimum overhead needed to establish it within the system in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nArtwork that we would be interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Fantasy of all kinds<br/>\n2) Sci Fi of all kinds<br/>\n3) Historical artwork. People, places, battles, ships, etc.<br/>\n4) People. Modern day. Other "modern" themed artwork may be useful, but we will have to judge on a case by case basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Any artwork represented a copyright or trademarked item, we can not reproduce and will not be accepted for this program. Ala, the starship enterprise, Darth Vader, the Coca Cola logo, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Any artwork deemed to be of an adult nature may be accepted, but can only be displayed in a separate adult folder which will only be available to interested persons of ages 18+ with acceptable ID. Adult artwork of a unique vulgar quality or illegal content will not be accepted at all since we don't like being sued.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We reserve the right to accept or decline any artwork submitted for the service on a case by case basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Not all art pieces will be offered for use on all products formats offered, depending on a number of factors to including but not limited to quality and size of the originals and how well it would reproduce at the size needed for the product in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny artists interested in working with us on this project, send e-mails to dowrie@guildofblades.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease include your full name, e-mail address, mailing address, paypal e-mail at which you can receive payments, and attach small art samples of those pieces you are interested in submitting, or direct us to an online source where the submitted artwork may be reviewed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRyan S.
