How do you try to get this sort of critique out of the friends who read your stuff and your play testers? Are you usually looking for some sort of critique in particular? And do you try to communicate that to your audience or leave it more open-ended?<br/><br/>Critiquers, I'm wondering: how do you make your critiques heard? And do you notice commonalities in what you say from game to game? Do you try to weed out your own prejudices when commenting on stuff? And if so, how do you do that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417243/#Comment_417243" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T17:58:47+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  5:58PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The compliment sandwich is a great technique:<br/><br/>1) Find something you think is genuinely good about the work. Try to make it comparably substantial to the criticism you're about to give.<br/>2) Offer your criticism politely. A good way to do this is assume that they've already considered what you're about to say. "Have you considered...? The reason I ask is..." If you've playtested it or have some sort of evidence, it's fine to make suggestions based on that. Just always be aware of when you're making an evidence-supported argument vs. when you're "going with your gut" - the difference between seasoned advice and a kindly suggestion.<br/>3) End by being  supportive of the continued effort by the author or the work, whichever you can do most honestly.<br/><br/>A warning, though: bullshitting steps 1 and 3 will usually be pretty transparent. If you can't do that, be extra polite with your criticism - instead of telling them what they did wrong, ask pointed questions that will help them discover the flaws you see for themselves.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417249/#Comment_417249" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T18:33:01+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  6:33PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a critique, I tend to give constructive criticism. I find that most valued myself as a designer because even if it's not something I can use, I can still get an idea of how my text was interpreted. When it's not a forum post I give feedback to, I usually write a disclaimer about me being straight and to the point and that my critique may therefore sound harsh. It will take to much time and effort for both parts if I tried to wrap everything in silk.<br/><br/>The less I like the game, the less I critique. I tend to always start with the good stuff and then write what I think could be could be improved. In Googe Drive, that's kind of hard and I have a tendency to forget to write about what's good. I know it's nice to hear that sometimes when all your document is coloured yellow. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Sometimes I even write a summery of what I thought of the game.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As a designer, I love when someone totally gets what I'm writing and give suggestions from that perspective. That's like striking gold. I'm mostly playtest with friends at first to fix the major bugs, but I also tour around at conventions. My next game have been playtested with 60+ people, as an example.<br/><br/>Before the session, I'm making it clear that it will be a playtest and that I will ask some questions about the game. I'm also making it clear, both before and after that I wont mind any kind of critique. I'm actually enjoy when people think my game is shit (is my standard joke).<br/><br/>After the session, I'm asking questions about certain parts of the system. I usually playtest certain areas in the game for a while, so it's easier to be specific. I'm avoiding questions that can be answered "yes/no" or "fun!". "What was stood out the most in the system?" is one example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417251/#Comment_417251" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T18:38:05+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  6:38PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I try to be very concrete in my feedback.<br/><br/>The compliment sandwich is great.<br/><br/>I ask myself if I can see how to introduce this game to a group of players and if it's clear how we'd play it.

They're someone I admire and feel I can learn from. <br/><br/>Often what I want and need, more than <i>feedback</i>, is to watch someone's face as they look at what I'm working on, and to ask them specific, probably weirdly specific, questions. "Did you read the captions under the illustrations? Before or after you finished this paragraph?" These are to confirm or call into question my understanding of my own work.<br/><br/>The other thing I often want and need is just for them to ask my any questions they have. Like, you've read my game, what else do you need to know before you play?<br/><br/>Getting these kinds of things from my friends is pretty easy, nowadays. I've figured out ways to ask for what I'm after. It took awhile! It's a little tougher with, like, playtesters, who often do want to give feedback, even though it's not what I need them for. When I put a game out for playtesting I just try to be as clear as I can about what I'll be asking for.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417254/#Comment_417254" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T18:54:16+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  6:54PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, I find there's two kinds of information that I am looking for in reviews or playtest situations. <br/><br/>1) Does my game system/procedure/mechancic achieve a specific goal, which I identify.<br/>2) What experience do you have as a participant of the game.

In the first case, I make the dang thing and then want to know if the overall design is appealing and what areas are unclear.  I usually present it to them because I want unbiased first impressions and then follow up with questions or say what my concerns are and look for their reactions.  In the second case, I usually want feedback on the idea, to know if they're psyched about it, and whether it's something we can engage over.  Usually if they're not psyched I drop the idea.<br/><br/>When giving feedback, I try to give priority to addressing any playtest/editorial questions they have.  I try to identify places where I'm confused, have to read a section more than once,  or could interpret things multiple ways where they might feel it's important that it be one specific way.  I try to always say what I liked.  I usually use the phrase "consider changing/adding/removing x, because y" - I feel like my feedback is well received when I do this because I'm not telling them what to do with their game based on my preferences but asking them to look at a part of their game from a certain angle or think about how a specific change will impact their game.  <br/><br/>While I seldom tell people something will make their game better, where I fall down as a critiquer is that I'll oftentimes  get all excited by their design and just throw out a bunch of 'what about this?' or 'it might be neat to do that' ideas because, darn it, I just like to brainstorm and maybe it will be useful or spark some idea for them.  I'm sure that comes off as noise to some, but not all, people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417263/#Comment_417263" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T23:13:35+00:00" title="June 26, 2013 11:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always run the math and check the grammar/sentence strructure obsessively.

Even if I don't use it, it inspires me to pursue my idea further.<br/><br/>2) If I have something I think will work but I haven't tested it yet, I just want to watch people use it and see what happens.  Critique then fills the role of helping to <i>explain</i> what I've observed.  Sometimes the explanation matters, sometimes not, but I often don't know which it'll be until I ask.  So, for that purpose, I just want people to tell me (a) what they did that I didn't notice, (b) why they did what they did, and (c) what it felt like.  I prefer complete honesty in this.  "I forgot that rule because I was bored by then, and I was bored because I hadn't gotten to play my guy in a while," might be <i>very</i> useful feedback.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it might be a case of "I guess this isn't your kind of game."  I've never had the luxury of taking games to only groups of players who I know will specifically dig what I'm offering.  So feedback that includes orienting statements about critic taste where relevant (e.g. "I only like RPGs where I stay in-character") is much appreciated.<br/><br/>3) If I have something that I have tested, and it works, and I'm refining it, I want answers to specific questions.  "Was it hard to find what you needed on the character sheet?" if I'm testing out a new character sheet design, etc.  It's sometimes not feasible to ask players to keep these questions in mind before play, so in those cases I ask immediately afterward.<br/><br/><b>As a critic:</b><br/>If I'm playing it with the designer, I try to just play, and resist the urge to analyze until it's over.  Once it's over and it's time to report to the designer, I try to find a balance between giving them what they ask for and indulging myself in whatever cool ideas come to mind.  It's easier for me to commit to the work of critique if I get to have fun too.<br/><br/>If I'm reporting to a designer who wasn't there, I try to tell them all the stuff I'd want to know.<br/>- Would I play this again?<br/>- If not, why not?<br/>- Any rules we couldn't find<br/>- Any rules we couldn't parse<br/>- Logistical issues (text too small, no one owns d30s, etc.)<br/>- Anything that interfered with players' engagement<br/>- Overall impressions for the sake of truth in future advertising<br/><br/>As for commonalities and prejudices, I know what I like in RPGs, and when I give feedback, I measure my reactions against my expectations, and communicate that relationship.  "I thought this was going to be competitive, which I like, but it's not, which was a bit of a let down," may not be useful game design feedback, and I hope they ignore it on that front, but it may be useful marketing feedback.  "I generally like this sort of brainstorming in games, but I didn't in this one, and here's why," is the opposite -- I really hope they do factor in my experience when they decide if their game is functioning as intended, because I may be their exact target audience.<br/><br/>I make no effort to avoid writing about the stuff that interests me, nor do I try to write about stuff that doesn't, even if that means I'm talking about the same topics game after game.

During that process I try to note down everything I run into -- wherever I have trouble understanding something, or think there are multiple possible interpretations, places where I'm worried I'd have difficulty getting it right at the table, stuff where I have strong emotional reactions, places where I'm skeptical about whether a process will work, or intrigued about how something will actually play, typos, grammar, text that's hard to engage with, etc. In an ideal world a designer will want to know <i>all</i> of the issues I run into (Many people ask people giving them feedback to self-censor identifying "minor" issues, I think that's a mistake but I try to do it that way if they want).<br/><br/>I try avoid making suggestions because I nearly always find it socially tricky to engage with people when they're giving me misguided suggestions about <i>my</i> stuff, and having your work scrutinized is tough enough emotional work that I don't want to add an obligation to express false gratitude for unwanted suggestions on top of that. If I think that there are issues with something that the designer isn't properly considering I'll try to ask a question that highlights the issue, hopefully as the starting point to a conversation. I do try to find some things I enjoy to mention so that my comments are more palatable (because that's what people way they like), but since I'm something of a perfectionist by nature that doesn't come naturally to me, so I usually come off sounding negative if I'm not careful.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417269/#Comment_417269" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T01:08:52+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  1:08AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As with others who have done this stuff often, I have many opinions on the topic.<br/><br/>The first thing I want to say is that as a critic (or an artist, for that matter), what I desire most of all is a non-emotional, rational working relationship. (This does not mean being machine-like socially, but simply watching yourself and setting emotions aside when they hamper operative action.) This is something that always comes up for me when somebody gets offended by something or other - as far as I'm concerned, the problem is always in the one who gets offended, whether it's a critic whose work was not used the way they desired, or the artist who didn't want to hear it said after all. There simply is no place for such human foibles in professional culture industry work; if you can't set aside personal feelings, then become a prima donna of some sort or get out of the business. I'm not interested in your feelings when I'm working, and I most definitely am not going to be your friend if this project crashes because somebody stole your lollipop; a worthwhile individual will always retain their sense of priorities, and therefore set aside their ephemeral monkey brain impulses for the good of the project they're beholden for. Go rant on a forum if it's that important to you (he said, fully realizing the irony).<br/><br/>(This has recently been a current topic of studio philosophy for me; I undertook to critique and edit an English translation of a game text for a first-time publisher as a favour, and now I'm getting very rude feedback from their translator, who apparently feels that any corrections of her work undertaken by a non-native person who does not have a degree in the English language is an affront to their credibility as a translator. Clearly her career is in the academy more than in the culture industry, if she can't simply take or leave each individual editing suggestion without making it a matter of personal drama.)<br/><br/>But putting that basic requirement of professionalism aside, what else? When I seek studio critique from outside eyes, it's for one of two reasons: I either want somebody sensible to gut-check that my work is doing what I think it's doing, or I want to observe how another person interacts with my work as an audience. In the case of roleplaying games both of these types of help (critique and playtesting, basically) may concern either the game itself, or the game text I'm creating. Thus we have four separate types of outside interaction: critique of the game, critique of the text, playtest of the game (usually with the designer facilitating), and playtest of the product/text (usually without the designer directly facilitating, because we're testing the text that's supposed to do the work).<br/><br/>I usually seek a critique of the game itself early on, as soon as I have a draft of any sort. At this stage I want the outside eyes to tell me what they think of the creative, cultural potential of the work - whether they, as an experienced game designer or player, see a worthwhile project here. Sometimes this is more important than others: a designer may have a clear idea of the implications of their core design, or they may not - and in the latter case it's quite useful to have somebody else take a look and tell you what it is that you're trying to do.<br/><br/>A critique of the game text, on the other hand, is something that comes late in the process, after the game's been designed. Test-reading, it's basically the same thing that literary authors often undertake to have done for their texts. At this stage what I most desire is a chapter-by-chapter reading diary where the critic jots down their thoughts and reactions to the text as they occur; this is most helpful in figuring out whether the text communicates the way I want it to. A second-best approach is to have the critic formulate their own judgement of what potential problems they're seeing in the text.<br/><br/>Regarding the two types of playtesting, the designer-facilitated testing (sometimes called "alpha" testing akin to how computer game production terms it) happens as soon as possible in my workflow, and continues through the writing/development process until there is nothing more to be learned. In this I appreciate it if the participants play honestly and express their desires clearly; I don't particularly seek analytical insight from others in this, but if somebody realizes something central about the game, then I'll be interested to hear what it looks like to them. Mostly I just want people to have flexible schedules and a lot of patience, and the good sense to be honest when I ask them whether they had fun, and how much fun they had.<br/><br/>The last form of playtesting is "beta" or independent playtesting, where the designer is not testing the game himself, but is rather observing. Ideally I'd observe a live session as a silent participant, but traditionally we have to rely on after-action reportage by the testers, which basically puts a great burden on the playtesters: at least one of them needs to know how to observe, and how to communicate the results. A clear testing brief helps in this a lot. At this stage I want to hear about any emergent behaviors the game causes, good or bad. On the other hand, I don't have much use for a playtester who boasts that they really put a game "through its paces", meaning that they'll play intentionally wrong to see if the game would "break"; this useless practice is a result of one-eyed parochialism in roleplaying, people thinking that all rpgs should somehow be able to deal with an illiterate munchin trying to be an asshole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417270/#Comment_417270" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T01:09:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  1:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for when I'm being a critic: I always start by formulating my own theory of what this game is supposed to be. If I cannot perceive a winner (a worthwhile game, that is) in that game text, then I can't playtest it credibly, either, so who cares about going that far. If the game is clearly not at beta test stage yet, I'll limit myself to a written critique that posits my hypothesis of what this observed game apparently tries to do, and perhaps some strategic notes as to how the designer might approach the next steps in the development process (research, try out a few things, start an empirical development program, seek expert help, whatever).<br/><br/>The above style of critique can be either useless or helpful, depending on what you actually need as a designer. Designers rarely tell me what they need, aside from eyes on the text, so I wouldn't know to skip this second-guessing anyway. Ideally a designer will see that I've grogged their design idea, or they'll see that I've managed to put it in theoretical terms more clearly that they'd known to do themselves, or they'll see that for some reason I see an entirely different game in their text - which is an useful result as well, if you stop to think about it.<br/><br/>If the game is playable, I might proceed to a playtest. In this fallen world this often means an unobserved playtest, which puts me on the spot both as the facilitator and the observer. I usually don't produce hyper-detailed accounts of anything, unless the designer explicitly requests that. My normal playtest report this summer (I've been doing beta playtests for others weekly for a few months) has been a 1-3 paragraphs about the general flow of the session, followed by analytics: what my revised picture of the game's goals is, and what issues I recognize in the game as it stands vis-a-vis that analytic picture. I will also hazard rules fixes where something useful occurs to me, or the game absolutely has to have some sort of patching for playtesting to proceed. This sort of communication leaves the designer with ample opportunity for further advice: they can correct me as to my assumptions of what the game is supposed to achieve, they can send me more rules, or they can tell me to stop testing.<br/><br/>Obviously the above sort of playtest procedure is not worth shit if you don't trust me as your eyes on the scene. Writing a clear and exact testing brief helps here, as that relieves the testing group from the necessity of doing analytical game critique: they can just test whatever the brief tells you to test, and report on the outcome. Depends on the project and the designer whether this is more desirable than the sort of overbearing analysis I've been known to produce.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417284/#Comment_417284" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T05:08:17+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  5:08AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2013 5:08AM by MatrixGamer.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To the original post...<br/><br/>\\They type of feedback I give and that I'd love to get is for someone to read my rules and comment on what they are thinking as they read them and how they think the rules work as they read them.

It's way more complicated than this, but here's some important things.\n<blockquote>Designers, I'm wondering: what sort of critique do you find most helpful? How do you try to get this sort of critique out of the friends who read your stuff and your play testers? Are you usually looking for some sort of critique in particular? And do you try to communicate that to your audience or leave it more open-ended?</blockquote>\n- I really want critique that points out the strengths and weaknesses of my designs. I want feedback that will help make my stuff better, objectively, in lots of ways. I want critique from multiple viewpoints, experts and noobs, and I gather all of it and pick and choose the pieces that seem most relevant and helpful. Sometimes it's simple technical corrections (grammar, explaining rules), other times mechanics suggestions (use two dice instead of three, do this on ties instead), other times thematic suggestions (this seems more interesting for your setting because of these relevant reasons).<br/><br/>- I ask for general feedback, and also specific feedback for areas I don't like or would like to improve. I know where my design is weakest, and I want to poke at that until it's brilliant.<br/><br/>- Sometimes I'll just ask people generally what they think, like it's a test, and see if they can pick out the weaknesses I see without me pointing at them. This confirms for me that's a real weakness.<br/><br/>- Sometimes I'll ask people generally what they think and listen really hard. I want to hear what they like about it, and what they find intriguing. That's what I want to do more of.<br/><br/>- I'll never compromise my vision for someone's opinion, but I will consider altering it if I get the same feedback from a bunch of people. That means they're seeing something I'm not seeing, and I should pay attention to what that is.<br/><br/>- I absolutely love it when people pick apart my stuff. It's a compliment to have someone look over it that hard, give really thoughtful feedback, and dive into it as much as I am. <br/><br/>- I make sure to remove the bias from what I hear from my critiquers. If they're critiquing it from a feminist standpoint, that's valuable from that angle, but doesn't answer the non-feminist critique I need. I also know that comes with the baggage of the history from that school of thought, so I have to be wary what kinds of things that person is using to frame their critique, and adjust accordingly for my needs.<br/><br/>- Receiving critique is a practiced skill. Doing it a whole bunch helps you remove biases, and look at something from as critical a design perspective as you can. I was lucky and had artists for parents, so I learned how to receive critique on my work growing up. Even so, it can still be kind of hard to hear stuff I don't want to hear. Sometimes I'll go "no, you're totally fucking wrong!" and then five minutes later take another look at it and go "nevermind, you're totally right."<br/><br/>- It's hard to listed to critique of a thing you've worked really hard on (you're protective of it!) but it's good to get perspective on what your work is communicating, regardless of what you intended it to communicate. So for me, if someone can read what I wrote, and without me telling them what it means gather that meaning on their own, I've been successful.<br/><br/>- I also don't let any dickbag on the internet give me critique. Random feedback is good, but in order to fine tune your work you need critical thinkers whose intentions are to help you. Listen to unskilled critique (other perspectives are always valuable), but don't take it to heart.<br/><br/>- Asking leading questions can sometimes be valuable, as long as you realize you're leading. "What do you think of this particular mechanic? I feel like it could be a little more dynamic, because in my playtests people have just kind of found it meh. Do you think that's a valid observation?"<br/><br/>\n<blockquote> Critiquers, I'm wondering: how do you make your critiques heard? And do you notice commonalities in what you say from game to game? Do you try to weed out your own prejudices when commenting on stuff? And if so, how do you do that? </blockquote>\n- The sandwich technique is great. People are more receptive to listening to critique when you say something positive first. Say what they're doing that successful, and what their strengths are. Buoy up their self esteem by emphasizing you'd like to see more of that. Frame things in positive terms when you can, even negative critique. For example: "I love your setting, it's really lush and beautiful. I'd really like to see more interaction with it though, because right now it's just kind of a backdrop you can't interact with very much, and I think it'd be really cool to be able to immerse into that setting."<br/><br/>- I do pay more attention to certain things when I'm critiquing stuff, because these topics relevant to my personal interests. Knowing I do this, I take extra care to notice beyond them too. These topics include: gender, sex, futurism, historical references, dark aesthetics, machines, feminist and queer theory, race, sci-fi, power dynamics, fetish, art, adornment, love, beauty, mythology, anime, japanese aesthetics, etc... I get excited when I see these things and want to focus on them, but I also realize that might not be the creators intention. So I point them out because they're of interest to me, and then move on to the more relevant topics that the work is about.<br/><br/>- As far as weeding out my own prejudices, it's similar to the above. Basically, I try to be ultra aware of what my biases are, accept them, and then look around them when I know they're in play. For gaming, for example, do I like games with cards? Not really! Will I give it a fair critique regardless of that opinion? Of course! That's just my opinion, and doesn't really have good context when it comes to the actual objective critique of the work. Is this a valid thing to say regardless? Of course it is! Designers sometimes want to know subjective opinions, because often that will help them gather an idea of their audience, or what biases they'll have to overcome once that game is out there. Learning to separate opinion from objective critique is really valuable in giving good feedback.<br/><br/>- Ultimately, all critique is subjective. Realizing that will make you both a stronger critiquer, and a stronger receiver of critique. I can only bring to a critique the things I know. This is why it's really important to get as much critique as you can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417317/#Comment_417317" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T09:24:24+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  9:24AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I basically just need someone to look at my stuff and say, "That's great, but you can do better."<br/><br/>It's also useful to have in-depth discussions with other folks who really understand my design goals and the toolkit I'm working from ("experts" who care about the medium and practice of game design as much as I do).

General suggestions like "how about an endgame mechanic?" or "this game needs more random tables" are ok, but I don't want someone going "see, the endgame could work like this and this and this, and then there could be this kind of stat and...". Like <a href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">@anansigirl</a>, I don't mind people picking my game mercilessly apart in detail, though, because it's still <i>my stuff</i> we're talking about. The critic is not a co-designer. \n<blockquote>- I do pay more attention to certain things when I'm critiquing stuff, because these topics relevant to my personal interests.

I get excited when I see these things and want to focus on them, but I also realize that might not be the creators intention.

Sometimes people are basically not interested about the whole framework your game operates in. If I make a game that tries to emulate Stoker's Dracula, the playtesters who don't like the book at all probably <i>should</i> consider the game boring. Different games have different audiences, your game doesn't need to work for everyone.<br/><br/>Correspondingly, as a critic, it can be very tiresome when I give a gut opinion about some aspect and the designer (or her fan) defends that aspect furiously and challenges me to criticize it in detail, hungry to debunk my claims. If I consider some mechanic overly complex or abstract to my tastes, it's a valid opinion, even if some people love that mechanic.<i> I should like your game in the first place to become an expert about it</i>, so my negative opinions are naturally far more general and hunch-based.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417430/#Comment_417430" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T09:09:41+00:00" title="June 28, 2013  9:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Since the folks in the thread gave perfectly reasonable advice...<br/><br/>Feedback: I realize that, no matter how I frame it, the players will approach my game with their own sensibilities as cultural consumers.

As Graham says, it's important that the feedback is predicated on the right premise. Maybe you understand the designer's vision, maybe you don't. If you do, then feedback on how well the game implements that vision is helpful. If you don't, then saying a bit about where you can't quite figure the vision out could be helpful feedback too. What is definitely not helpful is an explanation of why you don't like that vision, and would prefer another one.<br/><br/>I think there's some onus on the designer to seek out people who will understand the vision, and try to explain it up-front so people know what they're testing for.<br/><br/>Within the above, what I find useful is:<br/>- Commentary on aspects of the game that seem redundant, defective or badly explained.<br/>- Thoughts on aspects of the game that could be developed further.<br/>- Feedback on stuff that seems to be working well.<br/><br/>Basics of feedback: it needs to be specific and detailed about what is or is not working. It needs to be explained without emotion or rancour. It needs some effort putting in to show that the reviewer does understand the vision and context (partly because that helps reaffirm that the critique is valid; partly because if the reviewer has misunderstood anything, it's helpful to know that).<br/><br/>As a data-point - not seeking to start a discussion - I do not find the "compliment sandwich" or "poo sandwich" as it's known in my neck of the woods helpful. I think it's mildly patronising to the person being critiqued to think that they need some kind of pat on the head before the bad news. If you're reviewing my game I'd prefer you tell it to me straight. I want to hear the good and the bad - if you can't find anything good then I need to know that. That said I do think this technique could help encourage reviewers to look for the good in a game rather than leap to criticise.<br/><br/>I think it's a good idea for those seeking feedback to think about what kind of critique they want. There's all kinds of levels you can look at - presentation, design, vision, detailed drafting, strategic-level stuff or nuts and bolts. Say what you want or you may get something different. Reviewers: listen to what the game designer is asking for and give them that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417451/#Comment_417451" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T13:14:33+00:00" title="June 28, 2013  1:14PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2013 1:16PM by mease19.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I really like is when someone asks for comments/reactions/critique/fresh eyes/review/etc and I give it to them and then they get back to me abut my comments.

I think it could be interesting to explore some case-studies with multiple perspectives, e.g. have a critiquer give their perspective on a particular interaction, the designer theirs, and maybe even have outside observers give their takes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417471/#Comment_417471" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T01:27:46+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  1:27AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a data-point - not seeking to start a discussion - I do not find the "compliment sandwich" or "poo sandwich" as it's known in my neck of the woods helpful.</blockquote>\n+1.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417577/#Comment_417577" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T16:25:43+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  4:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Super-interesting, all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417591/#Comment_417591" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T01:35:12+00:00" title="July  1, 2013  1:35AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2013 5:59AM by w176.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To make criticism useful you need to first describe what you perceive to be the problem, before you give a suggestion how to fix the problem. <i>"You should change X to Y"</i> might be the best advice ever, but if I don't know why you perceived there was a problem with X and why Y would fixed it I can't really evaluate your suggestion.<br/><br/>You should give feedback when you first explain how you perceive the problem. THEN you give a suggestion on how to fix the problem.<br/><br/>"When I read the game I had a hard time understanding what you ment with X. -<i> I think it would be easier to understand if you did Y."</i><br/><br/>"When we played the game X slowed us down, because going trough X step for step took a lot of time and didn't feel useful for the rest of the game play. -<i> I think it would flow more easily  if you skipped this steps and did Y instead. "</i><br/><br/>"I think X in this game is meant create relationships between characters. But because of how X is designed often one character end up with a lot of relationships, and some of the other characters ended up with very few relationship. - <i>If you changed this and did Y the distribution of relationships would be more even."</i><br/><br/>Because if you do this you make the feedback much more useful. Even if the designer don't agree with your suggestion, they might find the feedback of problems that you perceive with the game very useful. Or they might find you suggestion useful, even if they don't agree with you problem description.<br/><br/>This does of course go for positive things as well.<br/><br/><i>"X is the best thing ever!"</i> Might be really nice to hear as a designer but I want to know why you perceive X as the best thing ever. <br/><br/>Explain how you perceived X, and why X is great before you tell me that X is really good.<br/><br/>"We had so much fun doing X.

But I'm seeing some common threads arise. Most folks want to know if the instructions are clear, but also whether the overall design of the game is working, which are two different things. Most people want to know the why for the critique, and possible suggestions to make things better, but want the critiquer to leave things up to them. <br/><br/>Also: Not everyone is an ideal critic for every game. In general, many people have talked about the words used to make critique as important, though not everyone can agree on the best way to do that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre" title="Jerome_Larre"><img alt="Jerome_Larre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tengajdr.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/smallavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre">Jerome_Larre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417648/#Comment_417648" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T07:27:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  7:27AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To the original message :<br/><br/>I critique games mostly in two very different contexts :<br/>1) While reviewing for magazines.<br/>2) While helping other people do design it. <br/><br/>I also ask feedbacks on my own games, though review or playtests.<br/><br/><b>While reviewing for magazine,</b> i'll try mostly to answer about three questions :<br/>- what is this game ?<br/>- who do I think should consider buying it ?<br/>- did I like it ? (as readers get to know the reviewers and their taste)<br/>I try not to take into consideration what are designers intents, what can be made to get the game better or so. <br/>I only focus only what will get somebody who buys this specific game.<br/><br/><b>While helping other people do design it,</b> If not given more specific questions, I'll try first mostly to answer the same ones and check with the designer if it is ok with this. Then we can try to make it "better" once we are set about the first two questions.<br/>If I have a good enough relationship with the designer, I don't lose time with the compliment sandwich and I try to follow strictly three rules :<br/>- comment intents or the way to achieve them, but not both at the same time ;<br/>- separate very explicitly <i>symptoms </i>(what I feel while playing), <i>diagnosis </i>(what I think causes the problem), and <i>prescription </i>(what I believe to be the solution). This is really important as most people are very good at finding something is wrong but suck really bad at finding out how to solve it.<br/>- say everything what I think relevant, the designer will take exactly what he needs and doesn't owe me anything about what he chooses to take or to leave.<br/><br/><b>While asking help for my own games (mostly closed playtests, but also reviews),</b> most of the time, I ask to follow the same rules, but :<br/>- I try to initiate the review or the playtest to have specific answers about specifics, focused questions (most of the time, but not always). <br/>- I usually set up and write these questions down before the playtest/review and give them to the person only  after reading/playing (so questions don't influence whatever they're doing). <br/>- Only 4 answers as possible (A Lot / Rather / Not really / Not at all) and some free comment for each question. The point is to avoid vanilla feedback from people who would otherwise have taken the middle ground.<br/>- If it is a playtest, I try people not to speak between each other before to give the answer, then, we talk together (especially about their comment). This is to avoid people's opinion to contaminate the others.<br/>- Then we have a free discussion, where the focus is on getting more info (more detailed, follow-up questions) and not to comment their feedback or explaining design choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
