This got me thinking, what about all those other games that reference aspects of another country\u2019s culture? Many of them will be games from outside the US and Canada referencing those countries, since North American culture is so pervasive these days (forex my game about delinquent aliens set in a US college frat house), but not all. There are currently a whole crop of games that make reference to anime and other aspects of Japanese culture- how do/will they go down in Japan? Then there\u2019s the Marquis of Ferrara, from my fellow Collectivists the Pompey Crew. And so on.<br/><br/>How do designers who reference the culture of other countries\u2019, or set their game wholesale in that culture, even though they\u2019re not from it themselves, approach the process? Do they attempt to be as realistic as possible, either by doing a huge amount of research or employing other folks, perhaps people from that country, as consultants? Or do they just write the game and hope for the best? Or do they not aim for verisimilitude at all, on the basis that its only a game after all, and not an entry in Wikipedia?<br/><br/>And how do folks from countries thus referenced feel when designers set those games in their country? There must occasionally be some real howlers, how do they react to them? <br/><br/>There are actually a number of settings I\u2019d like to use for games that are at a far remove from my own culture, the African Congo for one, which could so easily, if I\u2019m not careful, turn out disastrously and be excoriated by people from that culture as a gross travesty of it. Etc.

I have no particular intent to stop discoursing upon the world because I am not "from there" for most parts of it. It would be an awful standard if we only allowed the big and important nations to have a say about the world at large, requiring everybody to limit their discourse based on arbitrary lines on a map. Goes for game design as well.<br/><br/>When I write about the world in a roleplaying game, there is generally speaking an intent to the work as a whole, and that intent determines how I treat the subject matter. So it might be a game about How the World Really Is (or how I think it is, anyway), in which case I would find it important to make my case convincing. The game or other discourse might be about perceptions or specific historical narratives or how the world <i>should</i> be, and in all of the wide variety of situations the standards of quality in writing are slightly different. What satisfies me in the quality of my writing depends on the purpose of that writing, not on an universal set of standards for writing about Other Cultures. If this were different, then logically speaking there is no reason why I wouldn't need to impose that same universal standard on all communication I do about the world. If there is or should be such a standard, I haven't figured it out yet - as far as I can see, needs of communication differ across the board.<br/><br/>When foreigners write about Finland or Nordic countries in general in a fictional context, they usually get the details subtly wrong so that the outcome has a plastic quality to it, and the events described often ring falsely. Quite often the falseness is simply because it seems weird to see somebody discuss a topic without using the accustomed tropes related to that topic, so even if their superficial facts are correct, the way they tell the story seems weird. This doesn't particularly bother me, that's just how it goes. If I got offended by something like that, just imagine how difficult I'd find it to deal with actual personal offenses and other small setbacks of ordinary life.<br/><br/>The actively negative stereotype about Finland is that it's an illiterate, boorish nation of alcoholics. I don't particularly mind that one, either, but that might well be because I'm too secure - and perhaps the Finnish national identity is too secure, more importantly - to mind about old stereotypes. Perhaps this would be different for somebody who feels that their national identity is more beleaguered, more under question, so that nasty bigotry actually feels like it has a bite to its bark.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423647/#Comment_423647" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T10:40:53+00:00" title="November  2, 2013 10:40AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When foreigners write about Finland or Nordic countries in general in a fictional context, they usually get the details subtly wrong so that the outcome has a plastic quality to it, and the events described often ring falsely.</blockquote>\nYou mean <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOO46W8x-Jc" rel="nofollow">like this</a>? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423650/#Comment_423650" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T16:02:53+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  4:02PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, write, but do as many of the following as possible:<br/><br/>* Learn about Tibet.<br/>* Ask Tibetans how you should go about this.<br/>* Understand the politics of an English man writing about Tibet.

Which results in many people not being used to or willing to use English in their relaxation time. It has gotten better and especially in the roleplaying scene we have many anglophone people, coming from the overlap with academia. But it is worth noting. So we often do get games at least filtered by translation.<br/>The german history of course leads to some stereotypes and themes that gather lots of interest but also are difficult to use in a game.<br/>I do not know of many german games however that use uniquely german concepts or cultural ideas, or set out to do so. Of course games written by Germans and in German do show the culture.\n<blockquote>How do designers who reference the culture of other countries\u2019, or set their game wholesale in that culture, even though they\u2019re not from it themselves, approach the process?

Or do they just write the game and hope for the best? Or do they not aim for verisimilitude at all, on the basis that its only a game after all, and not an entry in Wikipedia?</blockquote>\nI personally often set games in "Movie America" because the US culture is transported so much by all media, which means every player has a good idea about the stereotypical culture. Which means it is easy to make them feel at home there and reach Suspension of Disbelieve. Setting a game that just needs a generic modern background in Germany (or whatever your home is I guess) can feel limiting, people might be to fixated on stuff like legal details or certain places. You are more likely to run into players who get annoyed if you get their area of expertise wrong. That is why I use "Movie America" for my generic modern scenarios.<br/>I sometimes zoom in on the details if they are important for the theme of the adventure, by doing more research and relating more of the details I find out.<br/>I can't claim to get everything right or have a perfect understanding of the US culture. But I have spoken and interacted with many americans and often do ask questions about details of the culture. Sometimes for the purpose of using them in a game, most often just to understand the world.<br/>For a well researched game I would expect more from myself than the average Wikipedia article, my "unresearched" games use an article like that as a basis. But it might just come from my history background.<br/>I try to do such detailled research if I ever try to portrait a culture in a more serious way, especially if it is not as well known.\n<blockquote>And how do folks from countries thus referenced feel when designers set those games in their country? There must occasionally be some real howlers, how do they react to them? </blockquote>\nI do not mind people setting games in my country. The most problematic is the topic of Nazis and how it is handeled. I am completely okay with Pulp Nazis who are basically fictional monsters or even, if done well, an Inglorious Basterds treatment where pulp and seriousness overlap. But badly researched they can easily annoy me. I think Nazis or Wehrmacht soldiers being shown as somewhat heroic or as protagonists is the saddest thing to be done in media. But since the Old World of Darkness I have not encountered that for a while.<br/>Anyway crimes against humanity and genocide are topics that should be done by mature authors and with some research. Grey Ranks for example did it well and I would not fault Spione of Cold City for their portraial of Berlin and the cold war era.<br/>If something is extremly wrong I would probably just laugh about how people appearantly see my country and maybe make a few jokes about it. On the other hand the worst Germany sourcebook I ever read was written by Germans for Shadowrun.<br/><br/>I do shy away from topics like the Belgian Congo too. Recently me and a friend did not develop an idea for a Cthulhu scenario because using the soviet russian gulag system as a backdrop for supernatural horror did not feel right, not matter howe creepy a setting it would make. Same as I probably wouldn't focus a game on slavery in the USA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423653/#Comment_423653" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T17:00:19+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  5:00PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a student/scholar of foreign cultures, I offer the following advice:<br/><br/>1. Try to be 100% honest. To yourself, to your readership, to your topic, to real-world Tibet. Strive for perfect honesty, whatever "honesty" means to you.<br/><br/>2. Question your own motivations. <i>Why</i> do you want to make your work about Tibet specifically? Double-guess yourself, learn about what Graham correctly calls the politics of what you're doing, measure yourself against all possible such political standards and discover whether you're actually honest (and weren't instead being unwittingly dishonest).<br/><br/>3. Learn about Tibet, with a passion. If you aren't honestly passionate about the topic, then you've got no business writing about Tibet.<br/><br/>4. Temper your passion with an extra serving of honesty. Try to ensure you've learned enough about the topic that you're never writing out of enthusiasm alone. Strive to get the whole picture. both upsides and downsides. Pro-tip: this is where the majority of well-meaning writers trips and falls.<br/><br/>5. Do never attempt to erase yourself from the picture. Be honest about being yourself writing about these topics. Be honest about your limits. Explaining your own involvement with the topic is part of this, as is including a proper bibliography.<br/><br/>6. Discover that no topic, subject-matter or culture is something you <i>own</i>, ever. More likely, it own you. Be honest about not owning it, and do what logically follows from there.<br/><br/>To invoke a personally relevant example, as an Italian I was only amused, in the best possible way, and sometimes genuinely flattered at reading <i>The Marquis of Ferrara</i>, and that's because the genuine honesty of the authors so clearly transpires from their work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423654/#Comment_423654" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T17:01:39+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  5:01PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a side-note to the above: all 6 points apply, in only slightly different ways, when writing about "your own" (supposed) culture as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423658/#Comment_423658" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T18:19:35+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  6:19PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course you can.

However, if I were a loyal communist party apparatchik I'm sure I'd be saying Tibet has been liberated from a hierarchical regime that foists fairy tale beliefs on its people.<br/><br/>I recall reading "Heart of Darkness," by Joseph Conrad and then a few years later reading a critique of it by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achebe#Criticism_of_Conrad" rel="nofollow">Chinua Achebe</a>, which decries Conrad as a racist.  I think this position is rather extreme from my perspective, but I accept that Conrad paints a very 19th century European picture of Africa in that novel.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Simon use the concepts of Englishness, Britishness and United Kingdom-ness rather interchangeably.  this makes me think of my culture, what I identify with and what others supposedly of my culture are like.  I don't really feel very English.  The closest I feel to being English is via its culture, mainly literature.  Also, I like English humour.  Other than that my heart sinks somewhat, especially when England are playing football.<br/><br/>Equally, I don't feel offended by people from other cultures lacking knowledge of what England is like.

That assumption is that offending somebody is somehow inherently not only bad, but also the baddest thing possible. I mean, here we are worrying about the hypothetical hurt feelings of a Chinese communist <i>colonialist</i> (I take it as a given that any recognizable nation in political communion with another, while not given credible political choice about it, is in fact in a colonial relationship), and musing about solving the problem by <i>not</i> talking about Tibet.<br/><br/>I often get the sense that the origin for this extremely vapid standard of discourse is somehow in the old privileged club mentality of western European, particularly Anglo culture: because it's just a hobby, and we want everybody to have a nice time, let's not talk about nasty political disagreements at the cards table. This should, I think, not be the standard of discourse for any artistic endeavour; treating a roleplaying community like it was a Bridge club ignores the fact that roleplaying as a narrative medium cannot avoid talking about substantial issues. And with substance inavoidably comes offense, you can always find somebody out there who'll get offended by anything that matters. Trying to distance all possible substantial topics into genre literature la-la-lands just postpones the issue, ultimately; do it long enough, and people will start drawing parallels between the orcs and blacks - and with justification, too.<br/><br/>Given that offense per se is not a reliable gauge for what's appropriate and what's not, I'd like to suggest a different measure: attempt to capture the core idea of your art in your work, and capture it well. Create something that others will find interesting and elevating. Choose a target audience, and speak to them of matters you find substantial and interesting. Sometimes your choice of audience and topic will mean that somebody somewhere would prefer you not to talk; they may even put nasty labels on you, and they may even be right. However, this is still better than trying to preempt offense by constructing elevated standards of discourse. Even if you're the most horribly ignorant, bigoted racist imaginable, it is still better if you speak your mind honestly, rather than have you try to fake attitudes and politics that the majority (or right-thinking people, however you want to think about it) finds acceptable. If you don't feel it, there's no point trying to fake whatever brand of political sensitivity some external party might try to push at you - that does not make you any less racist, it just makes you a silent one. Rather, by being honest and clear about your ideas, you participate in the great dialogue of civilization. Free exchange of ideas is the last thing we should want to limit, and pressing for elevated standards of cultural sensitivity is a perfect example of a measure that comes with chilling effects: people will maintain their silence rather than risk being labeled an ignorant racist.<br/><br/>All this is, of course, not to say that you shouldn't research the subject of your work. I think that should go without saying for any endeavour where we reach for excellence. However, equating an offensive work with an unresearched one runs the grave risk of ignoring political disagreement: what if that person actually researched their work perfectly well, but what you're actually offended by is their conclusions or choice of perspective? What if somebody can disagree with you without being an ignorant fool, what about that?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423663/#Comment_423663" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T21:30:09+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  9:30PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>All this is, of course, not to say that you shouldn't research the subject of your work.

And one of the most fraught with the kind of pitfalls I describe, although I had in mind even seemingly unimportant details like the ones Eero and Rickard mention about Finland. I was really talking in general terms about the dangers on treading on people's toes by misrepresenting their culture. However, Tibet is a good example of what I'm asking, which can be fairly summarised by Eero's comment below: \n<blockquote>how to write so as to make a game "go down well" with natives with personal relations to your subject matter, and specifically how to avoid creating a travesty that would offend the audience.</blockquote>\nIt occurred to me that game designers are increasingly widening their range of subject matter, and looking into areas and settings that could become problematic if approached incautiously, especially if misunderstandings they unwittingly perpetuate are ones the peoples of those countries hear time and again.  I think this is especially true of designers of storygames, who seem to as it were gravitate to hotspots and difficult issues. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuvinen">@Eero_Tuvinen</a> <a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> I haven't had time to read through in detail the point you seem to be having a disagreement about, and I want to do you both the justice of doing so before commenting on it- I've just switched on my laptop to check messages and I have to go out again soon, but I'll come back to this discussion later on. <br/><br/>Just two points before I go, however: Piers raises a very interesting issue below, that of the possibility of looking through the eyes of the colonial oppressor- I think it imperative that, however dangerous this might be in terms of the risk of being thought of as reinforcing the oppressor's pov, such a character should be built into such a game in order to provide a full picture. I think Dog Eat Dog does this very well, and is an example of the kind of game I'm talking about.  \n<blockquote>Politically, Tibet is tricky - I come at it from a perspective that it has been colonised by an oppressive power.  However, <b>if I were a loyal communist party apparatchik I'm sure I'd be saying Tibet has been liberated from a hierarchical regime that foists fairy tale beliefs on its people</b>.</blockquote>\nAgain from Piers, another illustration of what I'm asking about:\n<blockquote>I recall reading "Heart of Darkness," by Joseph Conrad and then a few years later reading a critique of it by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achebe#Criticism_of_Conrad" rel="nofollow">Chinua Achebe</a>, which decries Conrad as a racist.  I think this position is rather extreme from my perspective, but I accept that Conrad paints a very 19th century European picture of Africa in that novel.</blockquote>\nOnce again, apologies for the misunderstanding. Mind you, although I was talking generically in my OP, now I think about, it occurs to me that Tibet would actually be a very good topic to write about, so maybe I will...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423680/#Comment_423680" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T10:23:57+00:00" title="November  3, 2013 10:23AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.tibetrpg.com/!Tibet/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tibetrpg.com/!Tibet/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_423681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423681/#Comment_423681" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T10:48:23+00:00" title="November  3, 2013 10:48AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Edit: I do not, of course, intend to address the Magus here specifically.

That assumption is that offending somebody is somehow inherently not only bad, but also the baddest thing possible. I mean, here we are worrying about the hypothetical hurt feelings of a Chinese communist <i>colonialist</i></blockquote>\nI'm not worried about their feelings, I'm just saying that by using any potentially loaded topic you inevitably risk violating the shared imagined space and moving conversation into the realms of the social contract.  I don't want to sit down and have a discussion about colonialism or racism at the table.  I'm happy to play a game that has those themes (Dog Eat Dog and Steal Away Jordan) but I can't see that I'd get any gratification if I was a racist other than to espouse my views.  At that point I suspect that other gamers would be offended and I can't believe for one moment that the designers of those games had that in mind when they wrote those games.\n<blockquote>I often get the sense that the origin for this extremely vapid standard of discourse is somehow in the old privileged club mentality of western European, particularly Anglo culture: because it's just a hobby, and we want everybody to have a nice time, let's not talk about nasty political disagreements at the cards table. This should, I think, not be the standard of discourse for any artistic endeavour; treating a roleplaying community like it was a Bridge club ignores the fact that roleplaying as a narrative medium cannot avoid talking about substantial issues. And with substance inavoidably comes offense, you can always find somebody out there who'll get offended by anything that matters. Trying to distance all possible substantial topics into genre literature la-la-lands just postpones the issue, ultimately; do it long enough, and people will start drawing parallels between the orcs and blacks - and with justification, too.</blockquote>\nI take particular offence at the term "vapid standard of discourse," and the subsequent potentially racist generalization about "Anglo culture."  I'm getting a sense that you privilege a certain kind of play and a certain kind of discourse and people who don't follow that model are in some way "vapid."  A roleplaying community is a pretty diverse bunch - with some I will take risks and with others I will play it safe.  Sitting down at the gaming table is partly about finding out where the other people are at and being respectful of that.  That doesn't mean that a game will be insubstantial - it can still be challenging but in being too challenging one risks alienating the participants.\n<blockquote>Given that offense per se is not a reliable gauge for what's appropriate and what's not</blockquote>\nOK, but who gets to say what is appropriate\n<blockquote>Even if you're the most horribly ignorant, bigoted racist imaginable, it is still better if you speak your mind honestly, rather than have you try to fake attitudes and politics that the majority (or right-thinking people, however you want to think about it) finds acceptable.</blockquote>\nWhy?  Surely, from that perspective, it is better to attempt to subvert peoples' beliefs.<br/><br/>Your attitude is that by stating what is honestly in your mind at least you're expressing truth.  You've done it here and the effect it has on me is I feel offended and unreceptive to your ideas.  I'm not going to turn around and say that you're right, no matter whether there is any value in what you say.<br/><br/>Humans are social, and want to affect their surrounding social structures.  I don't believe human communication works by stating the "facts" in your mind.  Instead, people have to be in some way receptive to your messages.  Isn't this what goes on at the game table also?  We attempt to introduce information at the game table that stimulates our and others creativity in a hopefully positive feedback loop.  Otherwise, you can game in the way you want but you'll have to surround yourself with people who either tolerate you, forget to call you, give you direct feedback about what it is like to game with you or tell you to go fuck yourself. <br/><br/>But as a "secure Finn" I imagine it doesn't matter to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_423683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423683/#Comment_423683" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T10:56:08+00:00" title="November  3, 2013 10:56AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2013 10:58AM by contracycle.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> I mean, here we are worrying about the hypothetical hurt feelings of a Chinese communist <i>colonialist</i> (I take it as a given that any recognizable nation in political communion with another, while not given credible political choice about it, is in fact in a colonial relationship), and musing about solving the problem by <i>not</i> talking about Tibet.</blockquote>\nThat must be a sort of Colonialism With Chinese Characteristics, then, as I'm unaware of any case of European colonialism that nearly doubled the average life expectancy of the colonised.<br/><br/>More broadly: absent perfect information, there is no way one for anyone to depict any foreign culture with completeness and truth.

I was just pointing out how I see parallels in the social attitudes of modern gamers and these types of clubs. It's the same phenomenon that's often discussed under the rubric of "geek social fallacy", this tendency towards attempting to depoliticize the hobby and pretend that we all must be friends because we play similar games. It makes sense for a Bridge club, because you can perfectly well play cards together without talking politics, but it's a less robust principle when applied to an entire field of publishing, which is what it amounts to when we're talking about what kinds of games people should design and publish.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Even if you're the most horribly ignorant, bigoted racist imaginable, it is still better if you speak your mind honestly, rather than have you try to fake attitudes and politics that the majority (or right-thinking people, however you want to think about it) finds acceptable.</blockquote>\nWhy?  Surely, from that perspective, it is better to attempt to subvert peoples' beliefs.<br/></blockquote>\nBetter for you, maybe, but not better for the community as whole. The cultural discourse as a whole, including all gaming and whatever cultural endeavours we engage in, ultimately derives its legitimacy from honesty, because without that the cultural process doesn't produce useful insight. It is better for the general advancement of culture if we don't pretend to agreement, as you seem to be arguing. I admit that I'm less likely to personally get invited to the in-crowd dinner party if I disagree with the common wisdom (not saying that this is the case here, just speaking generally), but if I care about the truth-discovery function of culture at all, then I will debate in good faith instead of pretending to ideals I do not hold.\n<blockquote><br/>Your attitude is that by stating what is honestly in your mind at least you're expressing truth.

Most of your points concern actual play at the gaming table, while I was mostly addressing Catty's question about what he should be writing about. These are pretty different questions, as one concerns standards of acceptable public speech (in the form of game-writing, in this case), while the other is a matter of social philosophy on how to build a gaming group. I'm not exactly suggesting that you should play with horrible racists or whatever as long as they're willing to be honestly racist at your gaming table, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423689/#Comment_423689" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T15:14:08+00:00" title="November  3, 2013  3:14PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2013 3:14PM by catty_big.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>now I think about, it occurs to me that Tibet would actually be a very good topic to write about, so maybe I will...</blockquote>\nBut...\n<blockquote><a href="http://www.tibetrpg.com/!Tibet/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tibetrpg.com/!Tibet/</a></blockquote>\nAh well, that's that then.

It shows that misrepresentation of otherness- be it national, ethnic or genderal- is fractal, i.e. someone from Group A might write insensitively or inaccurately about Group B, C or D, but equally, someone from Group A(x) might write in the same way about Group A(y) or Group A(z).<br/><br/>And I think this is probably the ultimate watchword:\n<blockquote>Acting in good faith does not mean you will automatically avoid inflicting gratuitous insult, but it can be forgivable.  Acting with malice, not so much.</blockquote>\nAn idea for a game is coalescing in my mind as result of this discussion: I had an idea for a novel a while back where in the meta-fiction the UK had been 'Islamicised' after some kind of war or Jihad initiated by a newly established European Caliphate. At the beginning of the story I envisaged a scene where the intelligent and cultured Minister for Homeland Security, Dr Mohammed Reza, is in his office, preparing to question Jesus McCabe, a suspected leader of the banned terror organisation, the Cross of St George. First, Dr Reza is seen seated at his desk, reading a document with a pained expression on his face. On the wall are framed verses from the Koran, along with, rather incongruously, pictures of the Lake District, where the Minister likes to go hiking with his family. Suddenly the door opens and McCabe is pushed forward by uniformed guards. Reza offers McCabe tea; McCabe refuses. Reza sighs, and begins an attempt to reason with McCabe, to persuade him to see sense and give up the armed struggle, but McCabe is implacable, and doesn\u2019t respond to any of the arguments that the Minister can employ, and, after an hour or so of fruitless debate, reluctantly and with a heavy heart Dr Reza hands him over to the Religious Police for interrogation, interrogation that the Minister knows will almost certainly involve torture. <br/><br/>So what you have is a rebel who is not wholly perfect (McCabe is resonsible for the deaths of thousands in bomb attacks on Government and religious buildings), and a colonial oppressor who is not wholly <i>im</i>perfect (Dr Reza is intelligent and cultured, and goes hiking in the Lake District etc.). <br/><br/>Earlier this evening I watched a programme about the Jews after the destruction  of the temple in Jerusalem, and the role of the historian Jospehus, who later became a trusted slave of Vespasian. Imagine a game where a- by <i>his</i> lights- fundamentally decent Occupation leader is doing his best, given the political  constraints upon him, to play fair by the people his group is occupying, and a rebel leader for whom <i>all</i> representatives of the Occupation, including their wives and families (I imagine the Occupation leaders will be mostly men) are fair game and targets for assassination, and somewhere there you might, just might, have a game. Oh, and you might think Dog Eat Dog is that game, but I don't think it is, as it deals with colonialism in quite a different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423691/#Comment_423691" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T16:26:42+00:00" title="November  3, 2013  4:26PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are not your readers, and you cannot assume to know their mind.

(Such a thing exists. For example, Finnish public discourse often puts great weight on foreign perspectives, somehow assuming that e.g. a British journalist writing about Finland has a more objective viewpoint and more worldly context upon which to characterize what Finland is <i>really</i> like.)<br/><br/>Combine the fact that people are often discussing subtly different things (e.g. perception of a thing vs. the reality of the thing) with the difficulty of ascertaining the truth about complex human things, and we arrive at the sort of general skepticism that colors some people's (including my own) attitude towards topics like this. It just seems immensely naive to decide on a model of interpretation like "the native viewpoint is always correct, worship it" and then aggressively throw all weight of your social authority behind it.

A few comments on Eero's post above: \n<blockquote>As a good scientist and post-modernist I of course accept that <b>there are no final truths, only iteratively useful models of reality </b><img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nThat's very amusing, and sounds like the sort of thing a politician might come up with when confronted with a statement they made which was later found to be, uh, not 100% correct. \n<blockquote>Finnish public discourse often puts great weight on foreign perspectives, somehow assuming that e.g. a British journalist writing about Finland has a more objective viewpoint and more worldly context upon which to characterize what Finland is <i>really</i> like.)</blockquote>\nAgain, an interesting perpective. Kind of like 'spectators seing more of the game'. As an illustration, from time to time I've been taken aback by things foreigners have said about the UK, but which, after a bit of thought, I've realised are correct.\n<blockquote>Keeping that in mind, I'll reiterate my suggested measure: when writing about other cultures, or your own culture, or other things between the heaven and earth, study your motivations, choose to work on worthwhile projects, and then throw your talent behind making your work excellent.

As I'm not, it would perhaps be more constructive to characterize that discarded proposition as an outer boundary on truth - we all agree that this absurdly reduced position is <i>at least</i> not where the truth lies. This is relevant because I argued for a golden mean wherein we would reserve judgement on vague hypotheticals like whether it's OK to write about Tibet, specifically because it's evident that a stance of firm certainty is not warranted by the sort of epistemology I support. If it feels natural to ascribe this extreme position to a specific person, maybe that's because we tend to see some pretty extreme opinions expressed on political topics from people who are very certain about the truth, and very willing to be aggressive about it.<br/><br/>Debating form aside, I take it that we're in broad agreement, Gareth? Reviewing the thread, it seems to me that everybody who's voiced their opinions seem to generally accept that there is at least some room for foreign voices when well written, although we may differ slightly on the specific scholastic procedures that one might use in attempting for that requisite quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423893/#Comment_423893" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T08:34:17+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  8:34AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just like to add my personal experience to this conversation.<br/>I was going to write a game that involved Gypsies. I did do research and did try to put the Romani people in a positive light.<br/>However, because I had to describe the situations that the Romani people live in, I had to at least tangentially cast light on horrible racism and prejudices that Gypsies face.<br/>The problem was, condensing all of that hate into a chapter on setting, was really too much for any Romani to read. The goal was to describe what they had to overcome, the effect was to seem to endorse this behavior.<br/>I tried to navigate this maze. I tried to create a stage where I, as an author,  could portray the level of struggle that was required just by being born Romani.<br/><br/>In the end, my only choices was to either embrace controversy and stop worrying what affect this had on the Gypsies, or to completely remove them from the equation. After learning so much about them, I could not court controversy with a clear conscience. They were replaced with people that were noshing like Gypsies. I could have created an analog, but for me that was not intellectually honest.<br/><br/>Tibet is probably an easier nut to crack. While the situation is tougher over there,  The story of Tibet is not hopelessly intertwined with racism and prejudices. There are still pitfalls of racism, nationalism, etc. But you could probably tell that story without requiring/highlighting those elements.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gordon" title="Gordon"><img alt="Gordon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gordon">Gordon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423911/#Comment_423911" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T11:28:36+00:00" title="November  7, 2013 11:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave M - I could also totally understand "After learning so much about them, I could not countenance totally removing them from the equation."

In the case of Tibet, which can be quite a hot issue for some, look at the pitfalls of pre-occupied Tibet, talk about those, and talk about the pitfalls of occupied Tibet too. Neither of these places were perfect, because nowhere is. And in order to accurately roleplay, or facilitate a roleplay that takes place in an area the players need that information and that context. So doing your research, and accurately conveying your research to readers, devoid from your personal opinion, is what the best game in this kind of category should aim for. Anything less I think would be an insult to their intelligence, and also feels a little like being hit with an opinion over the head, which is never appealing.<br/><br/>Think of it from a position of: If I came to playing this game from a position of knowing only what a few newspaper articles had told me about the situation, would I be able to come out knowing and understanding a great deal more about how people think and live in this situation?<br/><br/>That isn't to say that every game needs to be 'edutainment'(Much as I despise that phrase), though. Nor is it to say that everyone who plays your game for three hours is as experienced and able to comment on the situation as someone who has lived it. But they should come away with a better idea of what it means.<br/>The important part of exploring controversial matter is to explore. Not to exploit. And I think exploiting actually counts if you try and push either side of a controversial dialogue too hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423977/#Comment_423977" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T13:32:17+00:00" title="November  8, 2013  1:32PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Gordon.
