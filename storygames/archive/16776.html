This is a book quite literally dedicated "to the far-flung indie game community," and constitutes an effort to put gaming and RPG scholars from this side of the Atlantic (Bill, myself, Emily, Todd, Sarah, Kat, Eric, Nic) in dialog with some of the prominent personalities on the other side of the Atlantic (Nathan, Markus, Jussi, Jiituomas). I want to thank them for all of them for their contributions. No need to Kickstarter this one, folks \u2013 it's currently in print and the more copies we sell, the more interest they'll have in continuing our line of RPG scholarship.<br/><br/>In short: this is an academic book specifically written for <b>thoughtful gamers like YOU.</b><br/><br/>As a teaser, here's the Table of Contents. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Immersive Gameplay: Essays on Participatory Media and Role-Playing</i></span><br/><br/><b>Table of Contents</b><br/><br/><i>Acknowledgments</i>\tvi<br/><i>Foreword</i> by Zach Waggoner\t1<br/><i>Introduction</i><br/>Evan Torner and William J.

That's PDQ for academia.<br/><br/>McFarland was super-easy to work with in many respects. They're professional and very patient. They also have a lot on their plates, so just don't have a lot of time to deal with <i>your</i> individual publication in their office, meaning that one ought not to be an egotistical drama queen in relations with them.<br/><br/>The book proposal involved me sending them some already-written sample articles, along with an outline of the book, target audience, and timeline.  McFarland is about completeness and professionalism over deadline-panicky craziness, so you can always push around your timeline if you need more time.<br/><br/>What really helped us out was a confluence of the following factors:<br/>* our proposal was specific enough to make an intervention in the field, but broad enough to encompass the volume's content<br/>* our scholarship had been accepted at a <a href="http://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/37482" rel="nofollow">regional academic conference of national renown</a>.<br/>* McFarland's published a lot of RPG scholarship books over the years (MacKay; J. Patrick Williams, Sean Q. Hendricks, and W. Keith Winkler; Bowman; Tresca; Cover), making it in alignment with their publisher profile<br/>* Bill and I have CVs that evince the fact that we've done this kinda thing before on a higher <i>niveau</i> within our fields and, yeah, we could get it done \u2013 also Bill's a tenured professor somewhere<br/>* Sarah Lynne Bowman, a published McFarland author, was in our volume, indicating a broader academic discussion of her own work<br/><br/>So advice I have to give is:<br/>* Be organized, humble and concrete.<br/>* Avoid major conflicts, egotism, and overly ambitious high-falutin' academic nonsense.<br/>* Get a combination of graduate students and professors to publish article-worthy schoalarship<br/>* Shoot for an audience somewhere in between the academic mainstream and your specific sub-field<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383231/#Comment_383231" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T12:47:01+00:00" title="June 24, 2012 12:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Evan, that's a great overview. As editors, how much influence did you have over the form of the final product? Did you have a strong hand in arranging the order of papers in the volume, nominating peer-reviewers (if any), approving changes in copyediting, having some say in what the cover looks like, choosing the title, etc.? Aside from having McFarland's assistance in publishing the volume (which is HUGE, no question!), I'm wondering about how the responsibilities were split over the course of the book's development.

The text was all 100% arranged and indexed by Bill and me - McFarland just cared about whether or not we had legally covered all our butts with regard to interview rights. We proposed the order and submitted the papers as one big manuscript. The headings had to be accommodating as the content of the book shifted around a little as we developed it. The title was a bit of a negotiation, again to maximize meta-data usability as well as to sound not stupid. McFarland isn't a "peer reviewer" sorta publisher, which basically means it's not going to count hardly squat towards tenure, but it frees you from the problem of someone powerful picking a political or academic fight with you. <b>*shrugs*</b><br/><br/>As for the precise division of labor, I pulled the thing along every step of the way, Bill pitched in his fair share at vital moments whenever he could, and the authors did a splendid job of getting me their texts.<br/><br/>Honestly, the most laborious part of the process besides the Index was just to get people to follow some kind of standard style/citation procedure, and then correcting the texts line-by-line when they had inconsistencies. I suppose I should've made the authors do that, but sometimes they wouldn't be as thorough as I was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383352/#Comment_383352" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T15:06:52+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  3:06PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><i>Deleting Memory Space: The Gaming of History and the Absence of the Holocaust</i><br/>M.-Niclas Heckner\t184</blockquote>\nWhat's this?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383353/#Comment_383353" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T15:38:05+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  3:38PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again, Evan. Very valuable details! Generally, that sounds pretty much par for the course.<br/><br/>Was there any discussion of you and/or Bill running a peer-review process on your own? Clearly, it would take time and more wrangling, plus -- given limited funding -- you might have to find decent academics/experts who would review stuff for peanuts, but that might still be possible given the infancy of this area of study. Maybe something better taken on in a subsequent volume, having had this experience, if you determine that it would be worth the effort.<br/><br/>I sympathize on standardizing citations. Footnote formatting is a major pain in our office too, though it's vital and often critical for a small number of people to do all of them using strict guidelines (we use Chicago, mostly), because otherwise is just looks jumbled and amatuer. Style can also be an issue, since it sounds like the publisher doesn't have a style sheet that they go by (?). Did you end up developing your own style guide?

He points out that, even in the ones that supposedly strive for historical accuracy, they present Nazis as generic bad guys rather than seriously engaging with German history, using visual motifs that give an impression of historicity while falling short of strict authenticity:\n<blockquote>One example [of a such a visual rhetoric] is the <i>"Unterstuetze unsere Truppen!" poster [in the game "Wolfenstein"], a clumsy translation of "Support our Troops!" and clearly taking off from post-Vietnam popular American rhetoric. Here, the game showcases that it is its obsession with symbols and tropes, rather than historical content, that functions as an immersive mechanism in the game. </i></blockquote>\nHe is thus unconvinced by claims that videogames have thus far been able to serve as effective teaching tools by means of their immersiveness.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383378/#Comment_383378" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T21:41:55+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  9:41PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Was there any discussion of you and/or Bill running a peer-review process on your own?</blockquote>\nSorta. I'd done at least one co-edited volume before and knew that peer review wasn't necessary with every academic publisher. If you know your topic material better than the peer reviewers and aren't shifting around nervously at your desk chair about *gasp* tenure, then they don't do you any bloody good.<br/><br/>At the same time, Bill and I wanted this volume to be a result of a conversation, not a dictatorship. When Sarah, Markus and others wanted to read the papers internally via e-mail and comment on them, I was like "Yes, please!" They spared us the effort on some of the feedback, in fact.  So not double-blind, but still very collegial and firm.\n<blockquote>Did you end up developing your own style guide? </blockquote>\nNot really. I just used MLA 7, imposed it on the contributors (which didn't really work out \u2013 half used MLA, half used APA/Chicago), and then <i>copied the style of Sarah Lynne Bowman's book.</i> The publishers had little complaint, and I never had to have existential style battles beyond a few.
