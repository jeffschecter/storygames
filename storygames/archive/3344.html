I was elated.  FINALLY it was here.<br/><br/>I opened it up to Page 1.<br/><br/>Actually it wound up being Page 184.<br/><br/>You see, the even pages in the front of the book are the even pages from the back of the book.  The odd pages are fine.  At the middle of the book, the even pages from the beginning of the book kick in.<br/><br/>So, technically, the book is perfectly readable.  In fact, maybe it's some new form of exercise that they're trying out.<br/><br/>Needless to say, inquiries will be made. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  And I am not going to allow such a minor thing to impair me finally getting to read this game.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Has this happened to anyone else, or am I just extremely lucky?

There's a lot of parties involved and the guy actually feeding a pdf of a book he neither wrote, edited, laid out or created artwork for into a printing rig has <i>little</i> incentive to put thought into the product. If something goes awry and he fiddled with the file, it's his fault. If something goes awry because input format is not what the machine liked, he didn't <i>actively</i> screw up. They will probably fall back onto an old IT saying: "Garbage in, Garbage out. Not our fault, since we used your input as is." This is why you order (expensive, single print) proofs to look at to avoid ordering X number of faulty copies.<br/><br/>With lulu, the problem is that there is not just one printer with one printing rig to proof from. There are at least two printers (for hard covers and soft covers) in two different regions (US and Europe). To make sure everyone gets the best possible results, you'd suddenly need <b>four</b> proofs (it can get even more hairy if the printers use different sub contractors for binding depending on the kind of cover you have) to make sure your product prints. Oh, and in Europe and the US, totally different paper manufacturers and paper types are available on the market\xe2\u20ac\xa6 you see where this is going, right?<br/><br/>In the end, how lulu and their printer (a sub contractor) agree on reimbursement ( that means, agree on who is at fault) is only one connecting line in the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">love triangle</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">quintangle</span> mess of Greg, Lulu, Daniel, Lulu's Printer, their Paper Source, The Binder and The Customer. Someone should make an R-Map from that. Let me add that Greg Stolze fills the Hero Gentleman position in this Map.<br/><br/>In this light, Lulu does a great job. But there's also a lot of room for improvement.<br/><br/>Side note: In the advertising business, reimbursements for bad prints are a significant source of income. A whole specialized industry of proof printing machines, calibration tools, standards checking mechanism and so on has grown from that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75737/#Comment_75737" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T14:33:28+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  2:33PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Yeah, don't blame Greg.

But it's not out of Greg's.<br/>- If the job had worked fine, Greg would be getting only what you paid, minus the print cost of the softcover (about $12), and minus 20% of what remains after that that (Lulu's commission).<br/>- Now you're giving him the cash that Lulu refunded you -- which would include what you paid for shipping.  So Greg isn't paying for the shipping here -- you are, still.<br/>- It'll cost him between $20 and $24 plus shipping to send you a hardcover, in terms of printing costs and whether or not he has a stash of pre-printed hardcovers.<br/>- That probably still nets him a profit per unit replaced (unless the softcovers were priced at less than $20; at 365 pages, I would find that pretty startling!), or at the very least means he's not losing any money by converting the money you send him into a hardcover.<br/>- As a bonus, he's also bought some good will on your part for upgrading your softcover.  This is worth roughly ten times the cost of printing and shipping you a hardcover, because it has increased the likelihood you will want to buy products from Mr. Stolze in the future.<br/><br/>That, my friends, is some massively intelligent customer service judo -- the kind I try my damnedest to exercise in the event of a problem.<br/><br/>Now, it's possible that this page-order screwup is due to the source files that Daniel and Greg fed Lulu.  I find that fairly improbable; while there may have been some troubles, there are very few varieties of those troubles that could possibly cause pages to occur out of order in the book.  Which is why I think it's most likely that the printer's at fault here and Greg is a ninja master.<br/><br/>This is however also an example of why I prefer to run a preorder myself, rather than an immediate sale through Lulu's storefront, if I can help it.  If I get a big quantity of orders from people, I can get bulk discounts on the printings.  And moreover, while it means I'll be personally handling the shipping, it also means that I'll have a chance to look at each book before it ships out and reject any obvious problems.  Those familiar with my great and twisty saga of Spirit of the Century's print process are well aware how much that procedure saved me from facing a situation very similar to Greg's...  though I'm not sure had I done it Greg's way that I would've been quite so intelligent as he in terms of how to handle it.<br/><br/>Now that I've seen him in action, I can steal his method, with great pleasure. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75775/#Comment_75775" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T20:01:08+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  8:01PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Now, it's possible that this page-order screwup is due to the source files that Daniel and Greg fed Lulu.

When reviewing Reign I had a very hard time deciding between reviewing what I had in my hands and what I *knew* you intended.  And probably produced, though the printing technology defeated you.  If a traditional publisher with real printing skillz ever picks Reign up, I'll buy two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
