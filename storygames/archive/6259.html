Its like you're taking folks skiing for the first time, and somebody says, "Didn't Sonny Bono die in a skiiing accident?" There is an inherent danger in playing a RPG that play will suck. Note that familiarity with D&amp;D means, usually, that players understand the suck-rate, and knowing it, are comfortable with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey basically don't know what the suck rate is on IAWA. Hell, I don't know what the suck-rate is. Vincent designs good games, and IAWA gets good reviews of play, but its early yet. So it's an unknown. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it's a natural reaction to fear an unknown. You're pushing their comfort zone. And there's not much you can do to fix that discomfort, except to play, and show them that it is fun. Hopefully it will be for them. You run the distinct risk that it might not be. And you may feel that, and be subtly telegraphing *your* fears to them. It's a feedback cycle. You fear that, because of their fear and apprehension, that they won't be able to fully engage with the game, and that this will cause it to suck. And they feel your fear, and so are more fearful themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor your part, there's only one thing you can do. Don't telegraph. Don't say things like, "Yeah, it's going to be interesting." If they have misgivings, just shrug confidently, and say, "It's going to be fun." That is, dissemble, and don't let them see you sweating. This is called leadership.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, any attempt to calm them down is likely to come off as advertising. If you're saying that it's not their fathers' Oldsmobile, that's definitely because it is, and you want to hide the fact. If you say "it's not as hard as you think," you'll come off as hiding how hard it really is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm going to have to disagree with Remi. The fact is that there is no real danger here. We're not really throwing them into the deep water, so... throw them in the metaphorical expert terrain. Knowing Vincen'ts designs, they're going to be more fun the more you engage the system the way it's designed. If you approach it tentatively, like wading into the water and getting wet one body part at a time, that's a long time of getting used to the cold, without the payoff of swimming over your head. <br/>\n<br/>\nDive right in. Let the cold be a shock to them, but then have them forget about that short pain as they then experience the wonder of the deep end. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a ski instructor we had a tongue in cheek phrase that we used to express this concept. "Faster, faster, 'till the thrill of speed overcomes the fear of death." <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. apollogies for the multiple metaphors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138700/#Comment_138700" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T10:43:33+00:00" title="April  8, 2008 10:43AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: Justin Bow</cite><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>The ongoing campaign is starting Wednesday night, and so far the main feedback I've gotten from 5 out of 6 players is...

That is, if you're going to throw people in the deep end, isn't there anything that you can do in order to ensure that they don't all sink? <br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately there is. Trust the system is a start, but every system is imperfect. Meaning it's good to have as much help as you can get to support it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sort of help?<br/>\n<br/>\n - Well, for one, try to play the game with people who know it and play it successfully. Harder with indie games, but this is the only reason that most D&amp;D games work at all. Because effective traditions are transmitted from player to player, and then from group to group. The text is probably not one tenth as effective a teacher of a game as seeing a group play it effectively. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Read up on techniques. If you're worried about getting players into author stance, because they've been canalized against it, then you could try the ideas in my recent thread about "pedantic" methods for getting people into that stance. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Be well prepared. Always good advice for play. For many indie RPGs there seems to be less prep required, and often there is. But that's not to say you can't spend the time saved tweaking what little prep you had to do, or in adding extras to play. Go ahead, make some props. Get some music that you think will be good for play. The contrapositive to the idea that fear leads to fear is that a good time playing leads to even better times playing. If they smile when you pop on some song, you're half-way home. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Ask for advice. We love to give free advice. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n - Redesign the system. Wait, didn't I just say not to do this? Isn't this where Mike and JD disagree? No. If you know what you're doing, and are actually pretty sure that you're improving the system for your players go ahead and do it. I'm not saying don't improve the system, I'm saying don't weaken a strong system by mixing up the messages it sends about it's play priorities, just to accommodate some players who may be scared about trying something new. If you can both bolster how the game works, and increase their comfort-level, why wouldntcha? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd realize too... sometimes it won't work. Even with the best system, there's no garuntee that your players will grok it. Sometimes it just happens that a game, or even a whole type of game, are just not what the Dr. ordered. Resign yourself to that possibility, and don't blame yourself if things go south. Just pick something else next time. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because failure can happen, doesn't mean you should try to mitigate it by diluting a system. Because diluting a system actually *increases* your chances of failure in many cases, and certainly decreases the chances that the system will be fun as designed. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138865/#Comment_138865" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T12:11:29+00:00" title="April  9, 2008 12:11PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had so much fun my first game of IAWA.
