It reminds me a little of Andrew Morris' old Unistat game.  PCs have four characteristics, plus traits and potentially treasure, each represented by a certain number of dice (all d6).  These dice are rolled at the start of the adventure. Then, during an encounter, enemies are represented by one or more dice.  The face value of the dice are known to the players.  PCs defeat the enemy by playing dice from their dice pool to match (or exceed) the enemy dice.  The characteristic (plus trait and treasure, if appropriate) used to defeat the enemy shapes the result of the conflict.  For example, defeating an ogre with the characteristic Toughness can be narrated as killing the creature in combat.  Defeating the creature with the characteristic Spirit can be narrated as recruiting the creature through sheer force of personality or charming the creature with an enchantment. With the dice rolled before the adventure, in an encounter I know right away if I will win or lose.  The similarity with Unistat is that in both games the player has some control over winning a conflict based on which die is selected (larger die type in Unistat, larger die value in Abstract Dungeon).  The GM advice and examples highlight improvisation, and non-creature challenges are handled just like monsters: assign dice and let the PCs try to overcome it.  "Everything has hit points" in other words.  The key decision for the players will be how often to refresh (and reroll the dice pools) each refresh reduces the amount of experience to be awarded in the game.  <br/>The game has a traditional strong GM role, with no mechanisms for player input (although lots of advice to solicit player input).  There is no mechanism for a character motivation-action-reward cycle, nor is there a real mechanism to personalize the characters (such as Fate's Aspects) other than, of course, through roleplaying.  <br/>It has some nice random tables for character trait generation, adventure plots, and treasure tables, which remind me of early editions of D&amp;D, especially with the inclusion of a vorpal blade!<br/>In sum, Abstract Dungeon is, as it describes itself, a "beer and pretzels" rpg.  Tastes will vary if its simplicity is a feature or a flaw. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson" title="MatthewJHanson"><img alt="MatthewJHanson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson">MatthewJHanson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441014/#Comment_441014" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-23T17:08:20+00:00" title="December 23, 2014  5:08PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2014 5:12PM by MatthewJHanson.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure.<br/><br/>The basic mechanic is that you have a bunch of dice pools. You have one for each of the four core abilities: Toughness, Agility, Spirit, and Intellect. Plus you also have Traits which can be anything from "Paranoid" to "World Champion Whistler," and you can have dice pools for your treasure.<br/><br/>The big difference between Abstract Dungeon and just about every other RPG, is that you roll all you dice at the start of the Adventure, NOT when you are about to do something. Instead you spend you dice as you go and you narrate your actions based on what die pool your drawing it from. You could use a die from Toughness to beat up a goblin or win a drinking competition, or you could use a die from Intellect to cast a spell or win somebody over with a well reasoned argument.<br/><br/>You are pretty much guaranteed to win as long as you have dice to spend, but it become a question of how you are going to succeed. <br/><br/>EDIT: Ninja'd by Mel_White                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson" title="MatthewJHanson"><img alt="MatthewJHanson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson">MatthewJHanson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441015/#Comment_441015" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-23T17:19:47+00:00" title="December 23, 2014  5:19PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel_White does a good job of summing it up.
