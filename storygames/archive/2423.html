                    Ah, gaming. It makes the heart sing songs of geekiness. Last night, we started playing Dogs in the Vineyard. As recomended, we started with collaborative character creation, so our Dogs would complement and conlfict in cool ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made Brother Gabriel, a "3rd generation Dog" (his mother was a dog, as well as his grandfather) with a Strong History who was "Educated back east" since he was a bright young boy, and recruited as a dog because of his family history, not really wanting to be a dog of his own volition. He's not much of a fighter, has an old ornery horse, and traits like "gets along with everybody," "let's not be hasty..." and "My Faith is my armor," which could end up being a supernatural-y trait. He also has a relationship with the sin of Pride. (well-educated, 3rd gen dog). His initiation challenge was learning to brawl, and after succeeding against an older brother who was working out his issues and fighting drunk, Gabriel got the trait "Good at fighting drunks," which I think is a fabulous trait.<br/>
<br/>
Another character was Brother Thomas, a fanatic from a Complicated Community who may have killed a family member, and hears what he thinks is the voice of God/The King of Life telling him who the sinners are. He's got traits like "Sheep from the goats," "The King of Life talks to me" "God helps those..." (an improvisation kind of thing) and carries a two-bitted axe. He also has a supernatural triat, able to "Lay on hands." His initation challenge was to learn moderation in violence, and stayed his hand (even having picked up a knife) when catching (the same) older Brother in a room alone with a young woman. Turns out the woman was his bastard daughter looking to join the faith. The man had already atoned for the sin, and Brother Thomas learned "Violence is not always the right solution."<br/>
<br/>
Our third Dog is Brother Caleb, who comes from a family of bandits (another Complicated Community), splitting from his history to become one of the watchdogs. He has a relationship with Alcohol, his scary bandit family, and traits like "All manner of violence," and lots of other traits that make him good at fighting, but so far has been trying to play things cool and talk through issues. His initiation challenge was to prove his devotion to the faith/remove his self-doubt. He stayed awake in a vigil for days and nights, then in a hallucination/vision, found himself a bandit on the road and had to regain control of himself as he raised his guns to an oncoming stage coach. He fought and killed five white-eyed bandits, and ended the hallucination/vision looking into the eyes of an infant child that had been in the carriage. He ended up with the trait "unnerved by babies."<br/>
<br/>
I love the freedom Dogs gives you in describing your character through the mechanics. That and Unknown Armies are the best at this, from what I've seen. The conflict resolution system is such that creative inclusion of traits will let you kick major ass, fallout when you're at the social-combat level is just as likely to be beneficial (giving Experience Fallout) as damaging in the long-term, and even when you get long-term fallout, it can still make your character technically more potent. Your character's mechanical/personal development is entirely in the control of the player. If you want, you can start with a Devout young hero and make them into an unstoppable Right Hand of the King of Life, or you can begin with a warm and compassionate healthy teen and develop them into a bitter hollow broken old apostate. It's all in how you want to do it. It'd be a munchkin's dream except the game anticipates the possibility of being super-powerful and basically says "yeah, so. They still have to make moral/ethical decisions, and that's what this game is all about." And that's a very freeing kind of approach. I'd compare it to Exalted or Aberrant, where the assumption is that the characters have the power to change the world, and thus the games focus is on the personal and social implications therof.<br/>
<br/>
After chargen, we had a bit of time, so we started our first town, Corville. Corville was founded by the Faithful, but in the last two years, they struck a gold vein and little Corville has become a boom town. We rolled in to a warm welcome and were hailed by Steward Benjamin, an earnest 30-something man with a beard and little mustache. He was surprised to see us, as the dogs usually came by their town in the fall, so we were half a year early. This is because the dogs who had been on the route had recently retired, and we were replacing them.<br/>
<br/>
The problems in Corville were threefold, all spinning out from the fact that Corville's become a boom town. The dry goods store of the Faithful Brother Virgil was being outsold by that of Jeremiah White, a non-Faithful man from Back East who sold liquor, coffee, and imported fruit from his store, as well as undercutting Brother Virgil's prices. Brother Virgil had been complaining to the Steward that the situation was unfair, and that by bringing alcohol into the community, he was sowing seeds of sin. Brother Virgil was made out to be Greedy and perhaps Envious of Jeremiah White.<br/>
<br/>
The second layer came from two brothers, Marcus and Jeman, supposedly Faithful men who had stopped coming to temple and were running a distillery outside of town to provide Jeremiah White with his alcohol. When Steward Benjamin went out to Black Canyon (where their distillery/house was), the brothers ran him off with a shotgun.<br/>
<br/>
The third layer was murder. The blacksmith Brother Asher had just days ago killed a miner in a drunken rage. Brother Asher was locked up in the Steward's basement, and by the Steward's word, was repentant for his sin.<br/>
<br/>
All of that is our background for the town. As what seems to be proper for Dogs, we came into a situation that was well and truly FUBAR. Jeremiah White wasn't breaking any laws of the Territorial Authority, even though he was breaking the laws of the Faithful. But being not Faithful, he wasn't under the direct authority of the Faith or the Dogs within Territorial Authority law. Hence the line "God ain't the only one in town with guns," which Brother Gabriel volunteered after Brother Thomas dismissed the idea that the Territorial Authority wouldn't take nicely to us plugging a hole in Jeremiah White.<br/>
<br/>
After getting the lowdown, we made our way to the dry goods store. We were waylaid by a crowd of the faithful who were all riled up over the situation in town. Brother Thomas intimidated them with his big axe, then Brother Gabriel tried to step in and make peace by being all social-tastic and handing out the mail, making friends. Both of us succeeded, and my character got experience fallout which he put into a relationship with Sister Ruth, a young married woman of the faith who I decided my character's mother had known when she passed through Corville. Hurray for making backstory up on the spot!<br/>
<br/>
While we were busy with the crowd, Brother Caleb snuck off to talk to Brother Virgil at his store, turning the open sign to closed as he walked in. Brother Virgil revealed himself to be jealous of Jeremiah White, believing that the money that was going to White should have been coming to his own store. Bro. Virgil professed that he'd give that money to the Faith, but Caleb was suspicious given the amount of attention Bro. Virgil was paying to the success other Faithful tradesmen and vendors were having due to the boom.<br/>
<br/>
The three dogs met up after the crowd was appeased, and spoke on Brother Virgil's case. They prayed together for guidance, and that was the end of the session. Plenty of Righteous Judgement to come.                </div>

                            Love the title of your town "God ain't the only one in town with guns" and the premise behind it. I love it so much I may model a future town after the idea. Very cool! I love Dogs. It's my favorite game, hands down.<br/>
<br/>
I love using the NPC generation rules from Afraid:<br/>
<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=294" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=294</a><br/>
<br/>
As well as the "escalation allows you to ignore a see" rule from Afraid:<br/>
<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=201</a><br/>
<br/>
It really adds a lot of tension as everyone struggles to decide when to escalate. And the trick of taking a lot of fall out from talking becomes much more complicated as you have to be extra careful of stalling in case someone escalated before you do (if escalating was your intention). I also love the drama of tossing someone's see dice aside as I escalate. It's also a great pacing mechanic as it's a cue to cut between scenes and you can now have other players jump into a conflict when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
I'm excited to see where you game goes next. Please post more!                        </div>
