Anybody here knows about other games using this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I'm thinking about using it to timebox flashback scenes and tie it to the reward system: each character can have X minutes of flashback scenes during the game, whenever he flashbacks the timer is released (i.e. multiple flashbacks are possible but each has only the time unused by the earlier ones) and he narrates a piece of his background to justify some character development (in game terms he can add a skill or resource on the fly). The quality/power of the "remembered" stuff depends of the length of the flashback (i.e. shorter flashbacks means less effective stuff). I'm trying to balance fun and reward: the player flashbacking monopolizes the narrative (although other players can participate they can't affect the outcome of the flashback) so I want to keep the flashbacks scarce but reward good scenes (other p\u013aayers can veto a flashback if the scene wasn't fun or interesting enough, as I don't want to let players just wait X minutes to get a powerful toy from the past). I still need more playtesting but I wanted to know what you folks think about this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162815/#Comment_162815" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-15T16:01:18+00:00" title="August 15, 2008  4:01PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Committee For The Exploration of Mysteries uses timed narration.  <br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo" title="Daniel Yokomizo"><img alt="Daniel Yokomizo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo">Daniel Yokomizo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163357/#Comment_163357" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T14:22:03+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  2:22PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the pointers.

In "Escape or Die" the timer runs for X minutes (where X equals to the number of alive characters in play) and after each time it ends the run every character gets a doom point. When characters get 12 doom points they die spectacular deaths. But characters also get doom points when they roll critical failures, so the character can die (of doom) much faster. Also as characters escape (i.e. leave play by winning) or die the timer starts to go shorter and shorter.</p>\n<p>As the time goes by the players start to do more intense scenes, they push their rolls trying to accumulate escape points (when you get 12 you win and get out of the game) faster than doom points. So the rhythm of the game is influenced by the timer (actually by the doom, but this is influenced by the timer). I hope this clarifies things.</p>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><i>Medical Hospital</i>uses a stopwatch all the time, to time procedures and also as a randomizer.

Arts and crafts.  They are timed to provide some pressure, and you are penalized if you go over time.
