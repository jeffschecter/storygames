What do you do when you need a custom move for Hard?<br/><br/>Having a Stats means that every move that falls into that domain, gets the same bonus. This can make the PC 'flat' and I understand your point in giving different bonuses to all, but there are implications - such as the one above.<br/><br/>So at least you need to consider: a) how do you build custom moves? (i.e. always inherit the lowest bonus? inherit the one of the most similar move?) b) if you make custom moves, do you keep them tracked in the playbook? c) you need to rework the advancements to the stats to become advancements to the single moves (if you have more moves than stats, maybe you need to give away more points)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435765/#Comment_435765" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-25T06:27:54+00:00" title="July 25, 2014  6:27AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thinking: stats are all about the overlap between moves, because different moves converge and form a pattern.

Moves, on the other hand, have very specific triggers. It gives the same info but in a way that doesn't constrain your choices by spelling out exactly what you have to do to roll well. So in my table experience, *world games work best when Moves are in the background, not at the forefront. That way they get triggered solely by fiction-based events with less mechanical worries.<br/><br/>Like, if the players are looking at a big sheet of basic moves, they're often going to be trying to use their best ones instead of settling into the fiction and doing what comes naturally. My best sessions have been the ones where I didn't even give the Basic Moves out to the players and just let them go crazy and leave the dice rolls for me to call out.<br/><br/>I can totally picture a player saying "I want to roll out of the way! Wait, I only have a +1 When I Dodge... hm... I guess I'll Stand And Fight with a +3, <i>again</i>..." I already see this, sometimes. Maybe your players are different, though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435794/#Comment_435794" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-25T17:17:52+00:00" title="July 25, 2014  5:17PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2014 5:18PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I see Stats as the baseline capability, without any training, that the PC can fall back on if they don't possess a skill.

Like I said, I never just roll the stats by themselves, nor do I generalize a move. For example, if we're playing Dungeon World and the Fighter is not in play with his "Bend Bars, Lift Gates" move, we don't roll when someone uses "pure strength to destroy an inanimate obstacle". Same thing when someone attacks "a surprised or defenseless enemy with a melee weapon" and it's not a Rogue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435815/#Comment_435815" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-26T12:04:29+00:00" title="July 26, 2014 12:04PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the fall and winter, I ran a *world exploration-and-resource-management game with troupe play where characters had no stats; instead, each had 1-2 special moves in addition to the common move.<br/><br/>(This was kinda necessary, as there were 16 viewpoint characters who got traded frequently between a rotating pool of 8 players, and players frequently controlled 2-4 characters each at a time, so each had to be very simple.)<br/><br/>Every move described very precisely the things that would grant you a bonus.

Another character has the "Demonic Battle Dance" move, which means they slaughter anyone they want (or maybe multiple targets) on a 10+, and get to choose options (which include the option of avoiding getting hit) on a 7-9.<br/><br/>They don't have "different stats", but their effectiveness in combat will be very different - and feel very different to play. And it also makes it pretty easy for that second character to "improve" by learning the Demonic battle skills or whatever.<br/><br/>Option b) might work in a game where a group of moves uses a similar design. For example, you could have abilities like, "When you use a move to influence those around you, hold +1 (1 more than usual)". Or, "You're a skilled warrior. In combat, on a 7-9, you may choose one additional option". If your game is designed carefully, this can work well. (It may make it harder to make custom moves, though.)<br/><br/>I don't see anything wrong with "meta moves" like "Trained by the Bene Gesserit: when you take a moment to focus before taking action, take +1 forward", or Apocalypse World's Daredevil ("When you go heedlessly into danger, take +1armor"). These, combined with a list of basic moves, could make the entirety of your character.<br/><br/>There's a X-Files/Call of Cthulhu hack called <a href="http://book.blackstarsrise.com/" rel="nofollow">Black Stars Rise</a> which handles this in a fun way: when your character gets "damaged", you flip over your moves (they come on index cards), and have to use the version on the back from now on (which is worse than the default version).<br/><br/>It has stats, but the concept could definitely work without stats.<br/><br/>Or how about FATE-style Aspects? By default, any move is 2d6, no adds. But if you invoke an Aspect, you add +1.<br/><br/>Lots of options here. It's nice to see some of them explored (like in Jeph's hack, linked above!).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435830/#Comment_435830" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-27T00:34:59+00:00" title="July 27, 2014 12:34AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's one significant thing you're missing.
