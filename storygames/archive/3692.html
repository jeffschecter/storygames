As one of the RPG coordinators for a large, regional gaming convention, this is something that I have an interest in figuring out. I had maintained that, by and large, there's a substantial population of gamers at the Strategicons who are willing to try new stuff, while jim maintained that even among indie gamers, people want games that are "safe" and "predictable." It took me a while to realize that he's largely right, even for me.<br/><br/>When I go to a convention, I'm extremely reluctant to take a chance on something completely unknown. My time at these things is too valuable to spend four hours not having fun. There are several factors that can mitigate my risk-aversion, but the most important for me is whether or not I know and trust the GM. If the person running the game is someone who I've gamed with in the past and had fun with, I'm willing to play less safe and predicable games. Some of my best gaming experiences have come from putting myself into the hands of a GM I trust and trying new things.<br/><br/>So my questions to you folks are:<br/><br/><b>How risk-averse are you when it comes to convention games?</b><br/><br/><b>What would make you more likely to take risks with signing up for games at conventions?</b><br/><br/><b>What would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?</b><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82761/#Comment_82761" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T14:30:09+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  2:30PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmm, good points, Paul.  <br/><br/><b>How risk-averse are you when it comes to convention games?</b><br/>A little.  Chances are the games that interest me are things I've read, heard about, maybe even chatted with the author about.  If it's something about which I literally know <i>nothing</i>, I'm unlikely to sign up.  But even a little prior information tips the scale and I'm pretty gregarious if the odds seem good that it will be fun.<br/><br/><b>What would make you more likely to take risks with signing up for games at conventions?</b><br/>Nothing, really - more information would mean less risk, so that's a zero sum game for me.  I'd like more information.  Link to documentation.  Tell me who is running it, what else they are running, what they ran last year.  <br/><br/><b>What would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?</b><br/>The reputation of the game and GM.  Lack of interest in the game, setting, premise, etc.  Lack of knowledge about the game.  The time slot (I can't play until 2AM, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82768/#Comment_82768" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T14:38:46+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  2:38PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'll sign up for basically anything provided that someone I think is cool is like "Play this, I promise it'll be fun."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82771/#Comment_82771" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T14:41:20+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  2:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I'll sign up for basically anything provided that someone I think is cool is like "Play this, I promise it'll be fun."</blockquote>\nSo, word of mouth from people you trust?

However, there is a side of me that is interested in stuff that has buzz from other people, even if I'm ambivalent about the description.  If there are reliable alternatives, I think about a quarter of the time I'll give something a try based on curiousity.  <br/><br/>Incidentally, this hardly seems unusual for consumer behavior.  Most fields have some degree of brand loyalty.  People don't actually keep trying new sodas every week.  <br/><br/><b>What would make you more likely to take risks with signing up for games at conventions?</b><br/><br/>I can't think of anything.  I'm more likely to sign up for a game if I know and like more of the people involved -- this goes for the author, the game-master, and the players.  However, that isn't making me more risk-prone -- that's reducing the risk.  <br/><br/><b>What would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?</b><br/><br/>Not liking some element of play: i.e. know and dislike the game system; know and dislike the GM or organizer; or know and dislike the players signed up.  (Also, if it's an unknown game system, the track record of the author will weigh in my decision, though it's unlikely to be definitive.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82802/#Comment_82802" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T15:26:05+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  3:26PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2007 3:26PM by Graham.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What makes a description good vs. crap?</blockquote>\nMmm.

It's like a tasting menu for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would make you more likely to take risks with signing up for games at conventions?<br/>\nThat being said, I'm just as influenced as everyone else by knowing/having heard things about the GM, or at least the other players. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?<br/>\nHaving had a bad experience/heard bad things about the GM/other players. Also, I'm easily intimidated if it's a game witha lot of backstory that I don't feel up to snuff on. <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I think the best bet for pushing new games is having the sign-up staff sell them. People come up and are unsure what to play. Hearing the staff say, "I've had a lot of fun with this GM/game" goes a long way. This doesn't bring people in the doors, admittedly, but it might encourage them once they're there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82821/#Comment_82821" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T16:19:53+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  4:19PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: devilmaycare</cite>It's like a tasting menu for me.</blockquote>\nPaul, worth noting - 15-minute demos and one hour Games on Demand extended demos lower the risk to zero, and drive me toward full sessions.

That will make more sense hopefully below.\n<blockquote><b>What would make you more likely to take risks with signing up for games at conventions?</b></blockquote>\nI don't sign up for games. Games I know I want to play are taken by internet ninjas who don't show up or book multiple games and don't show up. Or maybe they show up and I'm just jealous of their leet line jumping prowess. Secondly, I don't see why I would commit to a game I know nothing about. I don't see this as risk analysis, but as simple lack of interest. I'm not interested in searching through several dozen / hundred / thousand games trying to make a decision with the little bit of data you get from a game registration.\n<blockquote><b>What would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?</b></blockquote>\nSee above.<br>---------------<br><br>So my take on the problem. I think a lot of folks come to cons looking to play that cool game they don't get to play at home, or in that cool league that doesn't run regular games in their area. What I'm saying is they are deciding off of excitement. How do you generate excitement for games people don't know about? You have to get them to know about them I suppose. Perhaps through audio / visual means? <br><br>I think other folks like myself come to cons to play with certain people they don't get to play with in their area. I'm not really worried about what game I'm going to play at the con, but more of who I'm going to play with, i.e. self identified Indie folks typically. Mostly people I've talked or been introduced to. So I do playtests, simple internet games, the biggest of creator owned games, D+D and things in between. I just need open tables.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82909/#Comment_82909" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T07:08:43+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  7:08AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never been to a con.

I remember being jazzed about that game, because of the buzz about previous incarnations of it.<br><br/>At smaller cons, like at Go Play NW, the atmosphere feels pretty conducive to getting folks to try something they otherwise wouldn't -- the people running games can make effort to bring communicate their game to me (and, well, everyone's playing at the same time, so there's no opportunity cost to play a game).  At a hotel con, especially one with staggered scheduling, I have to find something that grabs my attention in a booklet (which are often poorly designed in my opinion).  At a bigger con, like GenCon, I don't even look at what games are going on.<br/><br/><b>What would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?</b><br/><br/>Words to the effect of "this game uses X system, but with some rules hacks."  That turns me off because either (a) I'm looking to learn how to play a game or (b) I'm looking to play in a game I know.  In the first case, I don't want to learn the game "wrong."  In the second case, I have to be much more interested in the idea in that game than I would have to be in a straight-run game of some sort, because I have zero clue if your rule hacks are any good or if they take out some of the fun I have with the game.  (That said, saying what these rule hacks are on a linked website would help me out.)<br/><br/>Anecdote:  I had a good time playing Brian Isakoff's hacked Spirit of the Century game that uses a Transhuman Space adventure, but I remember passing on it when it was on the menu at the previous Endgame minicon for the reason above.  Since then, I heard a lot of good about Brian's games, so I took a chance.<br/><br/>Also, any game more than 4 hours would have to be a game that I know for a fact would be amazing and mindblowing to get me on board.  There was a guy at Conquest Sac who was trying to fill up his 8-hour Call of Cthulhu game -- he even advertised prizes.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I guess a GM trying to shill me their game like they're hawking their wares, or any form of high-pressure sell, will put me off from their game.  The same 8-hour GM at Conquest Sac tried that with me, first opening with "we have prizes!"  (When you start with something like that, that hints to me that the coolest part of your game is when it's over.)  I wrote my name down on another game that wasn't going to start for an hour, and he tried to cajole me by telling me no one else has signed up for that game yet.  Needless to say, I passed on that GM.<br/><br/>That's all I got right now.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82959/#Comment_82959" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T11:06:46+00:00" title="July 24, 2007 11:06AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>How risk-averse are you when it comes to convention games?</b><br/><br/>My regular groups are almost all D&amp;D, all the time, so I look to cons to try new games, or at least games I don't have opportunity to play otherwise.

But in principle, I agree.  And to be fair, I dig on homebrew rules and will probably offer some of my own such con games in the future, knowing it'll turn off people like me who don't know what they're getting with my game.

I'm there to do whatever the RPG's main "thing" is (SotC = two-fsted pulp action, D&amp;D = dungeon crawling adventure, CoC = mind-blasting horror, etc); I don't want to be regaled by someone's tales of old PCs or marvel at their extensively-researched elven history.

Yeah, you could call me "Risk Averse" if you like. But I'd like to think that not signing up is actually taking the risk of not getting to play anything at all. With the payoff that I haven't had a bad game at a con in about four years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the idea of a Game Convention is all turned on it's head. That is, go to any other convention. What do people do first? They attend seminars, or social events first. They get to know the landscape of the convention, the people involved. Then, once they know the people and have found those who they think will have interesting information to convey to them, they then get with these folks, and discuss the important stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrast with how Game Conventions are run. You sign up for events from just the blurb in the program, knowing that this is the "business" of the convention. It's like you're going to sign the contracts first, without doing any research before hand. There's this frenzied rush to get in on the percieved gaming goodness. And, therefore, much of it sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've learned is that you actually get more fun out of the convention by hanging around the right places where you know you'll meet people you're interested in playing with (whether you knew them before, or they show up due to some common interest). You talk to these people and find out if they're interesting. Even if it's only ten minutes. And then you suggest playing a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it like a social mixer - would you date somebody without even talking to them first? When you had a chance to get to know them? I propose that RPGs are nearly as intimate (moreso in some ways) as dating. Yes, even dungeon crawling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think that the whole idea of selecting a game from a paragraph description in a programe is just broken from the get-go. Yeah, occasionally you luck out, make some aquaintances at the table, and have a lot of fun. But just as often you end up wasting your time. Why settle for that low percentage of success, when you can go at a more lesuirely pace, get to know folks better, and have more overall fun in the long run?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm averse to is having less fun. If I know of a way to get fun almost garunteed, then why wouldn't I go that way instead of the risky way?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82995/#Comment_82995" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T13:17:31+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  1:17PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2007 1:18PM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>What I'm averse to is having less fun.

I've attended a few "un-conferences" which are modeled after <a href="http://barcamp.org/" rel="nofollow"><b>BarCamp</b></a> -- where there is no program and people just come up with stuff as it goes along.  On the other hand, I'm working now on helping out programming for WisCon, which has an involved programming process.  <br><br>Go Play NorthWest worked this way, where people would write on a white-board what games they were running, and others would write in their names.  However, this had some issues.  If I waited for someone to make a public pitch for their game and find out about them, then their game might already be signed up for.  One good thing was that GPNW had official time slots.  So at least there was a time when everyone gathered and extra people could organize a game for themselves.  <br><br>Gen Con last year had games on demand as well as the short demos, and I played Shooting the Moon and Bliss Stage this way, but it wasn't all that compelling to me.  There were no time slots, so there weren't very many people standing around at any given time -- so it's not like I had a lot of options.  <br><br>I've liked some of the ad-hoc stuff, but I think there's something to be said for both approaches.  Especially if there are some high-demand events (i.e. everyone wants to play in Luke Crane's game, say), then the ad-hoc approach can be dissatisfying, since getting in depends on an undefined process.

This has turned into (a) assuming that if it's on the schedule, it'll either be full or I won't have time to play it, and (b) working to make my own fun.  It also means I may never get into any of Luke's con games.<br><br>Two, I'm at the point where I go to cons to see friends I don't normally see and socialize with them in person (or meet in person folks I know off of the internet).  I mean, I don't want to take a chance on a game it if means I could lose four hours of time with my friends.  It helps if I'm playing in a game with said friends, but the point isn't diminished any.<br/><br/>Cons for me are social events that happen to revolve around gaming, not gaming events that happen to involve socializing.  So, perhaps to frontload your questions Paul, here's one from me:<br/><br/><strong>Do you go to conventions to play?</strong><br/><br/>With the big ones, not really, though I enjoy it when I get to do so with friends.  With the smaller ones, like the Go Plays &amp; various game days, totally, but part of that is because the socializing is almost entirely set in the act of gaming.  That's not the case with, say, GenCon.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83065/#Comment_83065" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T15:58:54+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  3:58PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought that's what I already did...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83068/#Comment_83068" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T16:03:45+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  4:03PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2007 4:04PM by misuba.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be so wonderful if gaming cons actually had times where there was nothing but seminars, to actually get gamers talking to one another and start creating a community of practice.

Conflict with another more tempting game or activity.  Not being able to get in the game with my husband (our rare chance to play side by side, since one of us is usually the GM at other games.)

I come from science fiction writerdom, and every SF panel or seminar I've ever attended turned into something I could've just as easily read on Usenet.  I don't think this hobby is any different.  We've got podcasts, we've got forums, we've got blogs, we've got IRC, we've got Skype and Yahoogroups, we've got letter columns in Knights of the Dinner Table and APAs if you are OG... we've got a million ways to talk about games but precious few opportunities to actually play them.<br/><br/>So, by dint of rarity, actual play time is precious as gold to me -- especially actual play time at a place like GPNW, where I didn't meet a single person who didn't impress me in some way.\n<blockquote>But if you actually did it, the people who need it most would just treat it as an extended break period and bitch about the "dead time."

Right now, rpgs are the exception for me at a con.  I usually just play boardgames, which are far less risky. <br/><br/>At GPNW I loosened up and played three games I'd never heard of, and had a good time at all three.<br/><br/><b>What would make you more likely to take risks with signing up for games at conventions?</b><br/><br/>I look for writeups that indicate the organizer knows about the special thing their chosen game is best suited for.  For instance, if I'm playing Dogs, I want a moral quandry with no good answers; if I'm playing Savage Worlds, I want scads of figures and nice terrain; if I'm playing WFRP, I want liberal applications of filth and vermin and grinding, cheerful poverty.<br/><br/>(I once played in a WFRP con adventure that started with this big in-media-res fight scene.  Our party saved the town from Chaos raiders and rescued some prominent people and we were rewarded with ... a loaf of bread.  It was the most prized thing the village could offer.  I was stoked, and after that, I was ready to go wherever the GM took me.)<br/><br/><b>What would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?</b><br/><br/>Bad GM or player reputation, body odor, or a too-large group.  I always steer clear of a traditional low-player-power RPG that's offered for more than five players.  Timeslicing a GM more than five ways leads to long downtimes and severe boredom, and building a cohesive player group out of six or more random strangers, each of whom probably wants something different from the game, isn't my idea of fun either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83096/#Comment_83096" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T17:51:39+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  5:51PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My risk aversions, I think, tend to be more about people than games.<br/><br/>Or more to the point, I think I tend to go for, say, 75% games run by someone I've heard of, am curious about, or outright know.  I'm willing to use the remaining 25% (1-2 slots worth, say) on games or people I *don't* have a frame of reference for.<br/><br/>But more than anything, when I come to register for a con with the intention of gaming at that con, I already have a wishlist in mind and I try to fulfill that wishlist before looking around for the other stuff -- usually in the slots that reveal themselves to be empty of stuff on my wishlist.  <br/><br/>So with that as the context:<br/><br/><i>How risk-averse are you when it comes to convention games?</i><br/><br/>Once I feel I've guaranteed myself  a supermajority of fun, I'm willing to take risks with the rest of my time.<br/><br/><i>What would make you more likely to take risks with signing up for games at conventions?</i><br/><br/>Unknown games run by known quantities, or known games run by unknown quantities, have a much greater chance of catching the eye than unknown games run by unknown quantities.  So to take it from the other side, if I was looking to get a game "in" at a con where I was an unknown, I'd try to get the game in there by way of someone already on the scene, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>If there was a *dedicated set of slots* in which nothing but unknowns were being run, there'd be a higher chance that I'd end up in any one of those.<br/><br/><i>What would keep you from signing up for a game at a convention?</i><br/><br/>Frankly the biggest thing keeping me from signing up for a game is that game being scheduled up against games which are on my wishlist -- so that's sort of a scheduling/time answer.<br/><br/>Others have entirely to do with... what were they called? odious personal habits?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83110/#Comment_83110" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T22:27:58+00:00" title="July 24, 2007 10:27PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How risk-averse are you when it comes to convention games?<br/><br/>not very- for me the point of going is to run and play new things.

I mean, I run games with Lego and I make sure that there's a Lego dude on the sign-up sheet.  People who sign up for those games know what they're getting.  What I see has to look/sound cool.

So anything D&amp;D related, CoC, Warhammer, Runequest etc etc.  Frankly I'd rather spend that time in the bar than play any of those games.<br/>Anything with the word "Living" in the title.<br/>An illegible sign up sheet.  They look so much better if a Word template is available which people can fill in and print off rather than having to scrawl it with a blunt HB pencil.<br/>Someone who I know to be an utter tool playing.<br/>Someone who I know to be a bit of a tool GMing.<br/>Anything where I'm supposed to supply or create a character (unless it's a game I'm familiar with and know that character creation is part of the game, like with PtA for example) <br/>A historical setting.<br/>Anything which looks like it's going to "Tackle" "Issues".<br/>Anything which looks depressing.  <br/>Something which sounds like a fantasy heartbreaker.<br/>A game starting before 10am is distinctly less likely to appeal to me.  I am not a morning person and can only really function after 3 pints of coffee, so it's usually 11am before I'm in any state to get my head around a new system.  (Used to be I could get my brain going around 10am, but with smoking being practically illegal indoors now it takes another pint of coffee etc etc)  Also bear in mind that if this is a residential con, I'll either be arriving sometime during the day and will miss the first slot, or I'll have been up late drinking.  So I'd rather play something silly and familiar for that first part of the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83197/#Comment_83197" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T10:07:45+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:07AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>How risk-averse are you when it comes to convention games?</b><br/><br/>It depends on what convention!<br/>A convention in or near my home town, where I don't have to pay for a hotel room or travel for hours, and the people I play with are folks I play with regularly (or at least at the con the year before)?

Yeah, I can probably guess what it's going to turn into. On the other hand, if I'm really not sure if some particular horror game is going to be any good, but the GM has a reputation for running awesome games in a genre I enjoy, I'd probably go for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83211/#Comment_83211" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T10:44:42+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:44AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>Take it to a new thread.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3709" rel="nofollow">New thread here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83227/#Comment_83227" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T11:00:43+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 11:00AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/><br/>In fact, I would never play in a con game that lasted 8 hours, unless it was being run by Jason Morningstar, Clinton Nixon, Cameron Eeles, Mike Montesa, Eric Provost, and possibly like 1-2 others.

Now for myself, the thing that will make me take a bigger risk is a bigger reward.  This could take many forms.  One possible reword would be to allow me to sign up for the next time slot early if I agree to sign up for a game that is not filling up. For the Strategicons, this would be an event the next day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83347/#Comment_83347" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T16:22:16+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  4:22PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only been to three cons total, but I've always been attracted to the "For beginners, no experience needed" games.<br/><br/>Inevitably the people running those games were just plain excited about what they were doing and willing to teach other folks, so I had good experiences each time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83351/#Comment_83351" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T16:47:04+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  4:47PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, bribes certainly work.

More accurate, from my standpoint, games that state "For experienced gamers only" or "Bring your own character based on 120 character points" could just as well state "Wipe that silly smile off your face and enter MY DOMAIN!". Any game where you need experience to be accepted is a game that deserves to die an ugly death in its lonely, incestuous, unhygienic corner of the convention hall.

I suppose I stand corrected, to some degree. My viewpoint is from someone who attends cons primarily to try new stuff and meet new people. I understand that there are some very niche subgroups within the hobby that use cons as a method to meet yearly with other members from their subgroup for tournaments or whatever, and don't want to be hampered by n00bs. I sometimes forget that there are some games within our hobby that have so few players you simply cannot muster a group locally.<br/><br/>Still, a big, well-known game like D&amp;D? If you want to get your +2 Helmet of Tactics on and really plan out that siege on the orc fortress with experienced likeminded so that everything runs flawlessly, why aren't you doing it at home as part of your regular campaign? Why is your (the non-specific 'you') crunchy fun so precious that you refuse to give outsiders access to a con game? This is one of the reasons, I think, why our hobby is relatively small - we need to make our games, and our gamers, non-threatening and accessible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83395/#Comment_83395" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T22:37:16+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:37PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason why is because it's fun to play with strangers.<br/><br/>I can play chess at home, but at a tournament, I bring my A game and we get really serious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83412/#Comment_83412" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T06:37:35+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  6:37AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Eh.

It was okay, but it was <i>much</i> less fun than playing with friends.<br/><br/>Now, playing a competitive game (like chess, or a board game, or poker, or basketball, or whatever) against strangers, that's awesome!  I can absolutely get behind that, any day of the week; what I get out of a competitive challenge works just as well with a random guy on the street  as it does with my friend from kindergarten, and not knowing what kind of tricks the random guy might have up his sleeve is a nice bonus.  But what I like about RPGs is a bunch of stuff that is a poor match to playing with people I don't know, and so given a choice between going to a con and playing with strangers or staying at home and playing with my pals in our regular weekly game...well, that's an easy choice to make, and I'll save a bundle in registration fees.<br/><br/>It doesn't surprise me that other people might have different tastes in that regard (how else could gaming conventions exist?); it's just not for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83493/#Comment_83493" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T13:02:28+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  1:02PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I've done that.

This way I'm not trying to cram the notions of, say Primetime Adventures into a 400 character blurb. It can be done. But I'm probably not the guy to do it!  <br/><br/>By linking to a site we're saying, "Here, look around, check out the forums and whatnot."  If someone likes what he sees, he might show up, allowed to make a better informed decision.<br/><br/>Another though I had was links to pages GM makes.  These might be as simple or complicated as the GM wants.  But, essentially, they bust out of the 400 character limitation.  The GM can use text and art to evoke the setting, can place basic rules concepts right out there in the open... And provide links to other forums and such...<br/><br/>The appeal for something like this is that it lets me say what they heck I'm offering.<br/><br/>Cons were built on the back of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (and its children).  People who went to the Con, even in the cargo cult days (or because of the cargo cult days) kind of had an idea of what they were in for.  <br/><br/>But <i>Dogs</i>? <i>PtA</i>? <i>The Roach</i>? <i>Sorcerer</i>?  <i>The Mountain Witch</i>?  <br/><br/>For some of these games, it's almost an unfair and unethical bait-and-switch!<br/><br/>If we're going to be introducing new wares, it might be nice to let people see ahead of time what some of the cool games are.  My guess is many people would say, "No, thanks."  But others would say, "Really? We can <i>play</i> that?"

But if those conditions are met I've generally used the cons I've attended lately (which means: the Endgame mini-cons) as an opportunity to play stuff I'm curious about rather than stuff I already know. Closest to the latter I suppose was a game of Mongoose RQ; however since I'd never really had a chance to play a straightforward RQ adventure, let alone MRQ, it was new to me.

At some point I'd like to play some events where an understanding of the rules is a given, and the main attraction is a chance to play a game whose scenario sounds interesting...especially where it's a game I think I know well but haven't had much of a chance to play.<br/><br/>My overall approach might be different if I was attending a big con far from home. I'd try to book a lot of events to justify the time spent, and I'd probably go for a more even mix of familiar and experimental.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3692/convention-gaming-and-risk-aversion-what-makes-you-try-new-stuff" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3692/convention-gaming-and-risk-aversion-what-makes-you-try-new-stuff" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3692/convention-gaming-and-risk-aversion-what-makes-you-try-new-stuff/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3692%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3692%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
