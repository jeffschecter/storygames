Forming relationships puts you at risk but also opens you up to learn more secrets and information. Everyone\u2019s secret goal is unique and often puts the characters into conflict with some of the others, or perhaps drives them to protect or love others. Character drama is key; and since each story/\u201dcampaign\u201d only lasts a few hours, incredible drama and twists can spring forth through play.<br/><br/>The other half of the game is a light but strategic \u201cboard game\u201d style of play, involving a grid of skills, a battle/combat system of high flying action and tactics, and secret boost items and Ultimate Ninja Techniques will help the characters push the others out of their way as they reach for their goals.<br/><br/><b>GM:</b> Neil Smith<br/><b>Players:</b> Up to 5<br/><b>Slot:</b> Afternoon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455599/#Comment_455599" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-14T11:53:12+00:00" title="August 14, 2016 11:53AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you got a game to offer for the Cow? Here's another one from Neil Smith:<br/><br/><b>The Watch</b><br/><br/>The Watch is a low-fantasy game about women (and other female-of-center people) who are fighting to retake their homeland from the Shadow \u2013 a darkly sorcerous threat that has the power to possess men and use them for its own violent ends. So much has already been lost to the Shadow \u2013 land, loved ones, and traditions. But your people have come together, forming a new fighting force from those able to resist the Shadow, which they call the Watch.<br/><br/>The story of The Watch is structured around the military campaign against the Shadow\u2019s forces. You will tell stories of war, love, and sacrifice as your characters fight to hang on to what they have left. \u2026 The military campaign is what will give structure to your story, from the early defensive days of the campaign when the Watch is just trying to dig in and hold the new border, to the final days when you are closing in on the stronghold of the Shadow itself.<br/><br/>That you will defeat the Shadow is never in question. What you are playing to find out is how much will it cost you? On the day of the Shadow\u2019s final defeat, who is it that you will say should have been standing beside you? Which of you will burn bright and fast, and which of you will hunker down and see this thing through to the end?<br/><br/><b>GM:</b> Neil Smith<br/><b>Players:</b> Up to 5<br/><b>Slot:</b> Evening<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455614/#Comment_455614" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-16T16:19:38+00:00" title="August 16, 2016  4:19PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More games added by Simon Burley:<br/><br/><b>The Great Martian Tripod Race</b><br/><br/>Franklin is the first human competitor in tripod racing history, but his team has hit a few problems.<br/>His corporate sponsor is tied up in a hostile takeover bid, so the money has dried up.
