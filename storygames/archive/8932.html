"GM" duties are shared, so everything is player created. This works fine, though it is somewhat demanding on the poor players.<br/>\nHowever, I got a problem with recurrence in that you need recurring to player introduced content or the game stalls; characters NEED to get deeper, get involved in relationships, or it won't work. So what I want to happen is, as an example, that player A narrates this young boy, sick, and his mother, who is planning on selling her daughters body so she can afford the (useless) magic medicine from the charlatan; and that 1 hour later, player B narrates how the little boy suddenly appears again, having followed the heroes, and gets in danger and the heroes have to save him again, this time not from the disease, but from the orcs who want to eat him or something.<br/>\nBecause now, the player has to decide how much he cares for the little boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no "general reward mechanism"; right now, every behaviour I want to faciliate has its own reward mechanism. There's like 3 or so of these right now and I don't want to put them to new uses or introduce a new reward cycle.<br/>\nThe game is not ABOUT recurrence, but what it is about ("caring &amp; killing") needs recurrence. So, I ask you to just throw some general ideas around on how to faciliate continuity in regards to what one player has introduced to the story by the other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had one idea, I don't know if I stole it from anywhere, in that every player could at some points "mark" a detail and if another player used it in his narration, he would get some kind of reward, but as I said, I don't have room for another ressource pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, first post here, I don't know if you are supposed to make a general "hai guys first post" or something but, well, first post here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197282/#Comment_197282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T17:01:50+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  5:01PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, sometimes just giving something a name and writing it down somewhere visible and obvious can do the trick.<br/><br/>It's kind of a ritual, and also a place to look for inspiration when you don't have any ideas--like the equipment list on your character sheet.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you have no room for an extra resource, you can do something like:<br/><br/>You suffer a penalty, UNLESS and EXCEPT when you are [doing something with] a recurring element.<br/><br/>That wouldn't upset your current economy too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soundmasterj" title="soundmasterj"><img alt="soundmasterj" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soundmasterj">soundmasterj</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197283/#Comment_197283" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T17:08:48+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  5:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, it would.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of your ideas are really nice, but <br/>\n1. writing things down is already heavily ritualised in the game, <br/>\n2. there is no room for a penalty in general narration and there is no room for an additional "narrate this or else" in conflict resolution cause I already got some of these.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut food for thought for sure, thanks!
