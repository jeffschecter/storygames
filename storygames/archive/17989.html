Does the game fundamentally change or break down if your abundance is 'liberty' and your scarcities are 'equality and fraternity'?<br/><br/>Has anyone had any experience with abstract resources or have any thoughts about their use/misuse?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406532/#Comment_406532" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T13:06:49+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  1:06PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is among the things I was wondering about <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17940/scarcities-and-abundances-during-the-quiet-year#Item_1" rel="nofollow">a couple weeks ago</a> but didn't get any conversation.

Of course, I'm happy with the standard hippy answer "If it works for you, man..." but what I'm thinking about is especially when I'm introducing it to new players (even some non-rpgers) to the game, would I be breaking it or fundamentally misrepresenting it by including one (or some) abstracts?

For example, I introduced the scarcity of "hope" and someone else used "warmth," both sort of abstract concepts. By the middle of the game, we had conquered both: the former with a new church and the latter with a regularly tendered bonfire and a series of small, portable ovens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406544/#Comment_406544" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T16:35:39+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  4:35PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing about gamers: they're a clever bunch, and they <i>know</i> they're a clever bunch. They like to push the envelope a lot, in terms of what's possible in a design.<br/><br/>And so when I just listed tangible resources in the book, playtest groups sometimes introduced an esoteric resource. And when I just listed regular earthbound settings in the book, playtest groups sometimes placed their games on space colonies or weird surreal fantastical places.<br/><br/>When I listed "hope" as an example resource and "the moon" as an example setting, the cleverest ones in the bunch then took that as the baseline and wanted to push the envelope <i>past</i> that.<br/><br/>So, yeah.

If somebody else introduces an off-the-wall scarcity on their turn, I will almost always suggest something as concrete and immediate as possible -- even if I had originally intended to introduce my own unusual resource.<br/><br/>But there is also an enormous and very fruitful middle-ground between 'drinking water' and 'love', and it's worth distinguishing between purely abstract concepts and things which are concrete but unusual/unexpected. I have played a game where 'obsidian' was a resource -- a scarcity, it turned out. Obsidian is an actual thing, but what its scarcity might look like in a community is pretty abstract (it turned out to have a primarily social/ritual function.) Similarly, I have played a number of games where something like 'rituals' or 'traditions' or 'historical knowledge' was introduced -- very abstract concepts, but their application is fairly straightforward.<br/><br/>For me, the most interesting resources exist in the middle-ground -- they're unexpected, but as soon as they get introduced there are numerous, relatively obvious directions the group can take them. They have enough immediacy that the group can't just kind of hand-wave them away, and enough specificity that they don't just turn into a sort of generalized theme (this latter is I think a big problem with emotional states like 'hope' and 'love'.) And of course, they fit in somehow with the map and the landscape as it has been defined so far.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
