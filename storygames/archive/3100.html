Then be very free with compels they will want to accept.<br/><br/>Doing pregens is a very good idea for a short time slot, especially with six players! I would limit it to four players, personally, but that may just be my style. You could leave one novel blank on each sheet, and let the players fill it in. You might also leave a blank aspect or two that they can create.<br/><br/>Be very explicit about everything you do, system-wise, to show them what's possible. When they arrive at a new scene, lay out the scene aspects. When the villains ambush the heroes, have the bad guys assess and declare aspects right off the bat and then use the free tags to lay the smack down. Talk about everything you're doing, especially the stuff that might be "hidden" from PC knowledge.<br/><br/>And of course, get to the action immediately. If there's one failing of the SotC book, it's that the sample adventure is not a good model of a rocking SotC session (in my opinion). Don't give them a mystery right away, give them guys trying to kill them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70880/#Comment_70880" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T12:42:20+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 12:42PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I would limit it to four players, personally, but that may just be my style.</blockquote>\nThe way the con is set up, six players is the default table size, so I want to accommodate that many.

My current idea was to start with the zeppelin scene, basically as if we're in media res of a previous episode's climax. That'll be the "teaser," and then we move on to, "So, weeks later, you're all enjoying lunch at the Century Club's London office, when..." or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70961/#Comment_70961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T19:43:37+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  7:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, have a write-up for the PC stunts right in their sheets.

I feel like I know SotC forwards and backwards by now, but in the context of a one-shot with players unfamiliar with the rules, consider having some of their 10 Aspects suggest Stunt-like abilities and have them Invoke those Aspects (and pay a Fate Point) to "cool stuff".   Contending with 5 players (for example) that are dealing with 25 Stunts for the first time is a handful.  I'd probably still start with 5 Fate Points as suggested above, but hand them out very liberally.<br/><br/>If you expect even two players to know the rules who can help out the other players, I'd leave the Stunts in.  Stunts are cool.<br/><br/>At Dreamation, Judd had the players fill out their guest roles in two other novels and name those two Aspects that went with them.  That seemed to work pretty well.  He also had the Stunts listed and cool artwork to accompany each character, which was fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71028/#Comment_71028" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T07:30:50+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  7:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ren\xc3\xa9: Since I have the SotC PDF, I was going to just cut and paste stunt descriptions onto the character sheets.<br/><br/>Matthew: I see what you're saying, though Stunts seems close enough to d20 Feats in concept that I'd probably err on the side of keeping them.

It went absolutely nothing like I planned, and I mean that in the best way possible.<br/><br/>First off, I'd planned a "teaser" to open the session; basically resolving the cliffhanger from the previous (i.e., non-existant) "episode." Basically, the PCs are in the cupola of a zeppelin that's heading straight for the Woolworth Building in NYC, the tallest building in the world as of 1926. Also in the cupola are Doctor Methuselah and his two killer robot servants (Great minions). On the nose of the zeppelin is the Negative Temporal Device; once it comes into contact with the metal spire on top of the Woolworth Building, it will make use of the building itself and the zeppelin's frame to create an arc of Negative Temporal Energy that will send New York city 10,000 years into the past!<br/><br/>Then I had basically nabbed the "107 lb. quartz sphere of dragon-summoning" idea from the <i>Tips and Tricks</i> chapter of the book, and figured that would be the adventure "proper."<br/><br/>As you can probably guess, we never got to the sphere scenario. Between explaining the rules, coming up with guest spots and Aspects for the two final phases, and dealing with the whole Methuselah scenario, we killed about four hours (the perfect length for a con event, thankfully).<br/><br/>The start was a little rocky. I'd preempted our regular Star HERO game. One of my regulars was not nuts about this, and he also led off the night by proclaiming how bad he thought SotC mechanics were (having perused the SRD, I'm guessing), and how it "got pulp all wrong." With him, it's HERO or nothing, so I wasn't too surprised. Still, he's a huge pulp fan and a font of historical info, so he gave it the college try. He ended up adding a lot to the session.<br/><br/>The other hitch was that it took a while to explain Aspects. They seemed a bit hesitant that they weren't concretely defined, and one player thought that compels were, in his opinion, "too open to abuse." The other hitch was that some of the Aspects I posted above didn't make too much sense to them, especially Katar Singh's. That I can't blame them for; Katar Singh was the PC I did the most research for, a mix of Punjabi war hero Matar Singh and some bits of my father's childhood in India thrown in. Ergo, the Aspects make pretty good sense... if you happen to be Indian.<br/><br/>The final big blunder I made was that I didn't assign novels for them to use for Phases 4 and 5, which is what you normally do according to the book (i.e., hand out index cards with the existing novel titles). Ergo, it took a lot of time for everyone to come up with Aspects and figure out in whose novel they guest-starred.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71953/#Comment_71953" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T23:18:10+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 11:18PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, once we finally got started, things moved along pretty well. Doctor Methuselah bids farewell to the PCs, and then "solves" his way through the cabin wall and into a biplane waiting just outside, leaving his killer robots to "distract" the heroes while the zeppelin flies ever onward towards the Woolworth Building. At that point, the PCs were able to act.<br/><br/>I'd divided the zeppelin into five zones from nose to tail, with the Negative Temporal Device ("NTD" for short) a sixth zone mounted on the nose. It was also divided into an upper and lower set of zones separated by a Border of 1, with the cupola an third zone on the bottom, separated from the zeppelin above by a Border of 2. The Doctor's getaway plane was a zone outside the cupola, with a Border of 1 between them. Environmental Aspects in play were Windy, Long Way Down, Rain-Slicked, and Stormclouds.<br/><br/>I then decided, on the fly, that they had three Exchanges (it may have been four in actuality) before the zeppelin would reach the Woolworth Building.<br/><br/>Pretty much right off the bat, Vic Silver raced inside the zeppelin to get to the NTD, Mac went for the airship's controls, the killer robots attacked, Katar Singh tried to force one of the robots out of the cupola, Uncle Chen started shooting, and Ace took off after Dr. M (a retroactive compel of "Methuselah must be stopped!", since it meant abandoning the others to the robots). This division of labor pretty much lasted most of the session.<br/><br/>(We were one player short, so no one played Kid Kato. FYI.)<br/><br/>Ace wrangled with Dr. M and his plane, rocketing around with his jet pack. One nifty moment was Dr. M using his Epic Science and a tag on the "Patent Pending" bit of Ace's jet pack Aspect to basically place a "Going in Reverse" aspect on Ace. It didn't take long for Dr. M to eventually just "Ten Equations" himself, plus plane, away, basically winking out of existence. I knew there was no way for the PCs to really defeat him, so once I knew he'd wasted enough of Ace's time, I had him bug out.<br/><br/>Katar Singh was a sword-wielding monster, doing cool stuff like knocking one of the robots out of the cupola and onto the wing of Dr. M's plane, and providing an awesome Epic block to prevent the robots from smashing the zeppelin's controls to bits.<br/><br/>Mac was played by the HERO fan described above, who was awesome with compels that forced crazy, monkey-like behaviors upon him. I had to give him a lot of credit, given his initial dislike of the system.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71954/#Comment_71954" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T23:35:34+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 11:35PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2007 12:01AM by buzz.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the end, while Vic was unable to dismantle the NTD in time, nor were the others able to quickly dispatch the robots, they did manage (via general destruction) to veer the zeppelin off-course so that the NTD never touched the Woolworth Building. Of course, said skyscraper did manage to tear open a huge rend in the side of the zeppelin, which then had the thing listing to one side and dropping down, uncontrolled, towards the city below. Thankfully, our heroes managed to finally take out the robots in time to jury-rig the damaged controls to gently land (sideways) in the middle of Central Park.<br/><br/>So, some questions and some failings.<br/><br/>First off, Uncle Chen seemed to be pretty useless. The setup was very science- and combat-focused, neither of which are really Chen's arena. He did, however, do a declare (with my help) using a stunt and his Investigation: "Ah, that purple control box was not there the last time were were in the cupola! It must be how Dr. M is controlling the zeppelin' course!" He also tried a block and did a few maneuvers, like throwing his coat over one of the robots so that it was temporarily blinded. Chen also has an Aspect that points to Kato, who was not in play.<br/><br/>Also, while Katar did much awesomeness with his sword-cane, a lot of his Mysteries focus was less than useful. And, as mentioned above, his Aspects were cryptic enough that only a few got used consistently.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the other PCs fared very well.<br/><br/>One ting I definitely noticed was that I wasn't compelling as much as I probably should have. I'm definitely going to make an Aspect cheat-sheet to keep handy.<br/><br/>A big question I had was how to make use of environmental Aspects. If no one is spending Fate points to tag them, do they have any effect? Do they just let me bump up the difficulty of simple actions?<br/><br/>My players were getting spin all the time! If you get spin on a roll that isn't defensive, such as a simple action, maneuver or an attack, what happens? Also, if the player chooses to give an enemy a -1 on something as a result of spin, how does that get implemented? Does the -1 need specific parameters? What if the enemy doesn't do anything related to the context of the penalty? I'm fuzzy on this.<br/><br/>Is there any value in a result that goes beyond Legendary? Does the ladder just stop there?<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71955/#Comment_71955" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T23:52:44+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 11:52PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'll start wrapping this up. I'm pooped!<br/><br/>The big takeaway from this playtest was needing to round out the color so that the disparate character types all had something useful to do. I.e., since I assumed we'd get to the quartz sphere scenario, which is very Mysteries-heavy, I figured the "intro" being Science-heavy would be fine. Not so, given we never even got to the quartz thingy. What I really biffed on was that Dr. M's whole shtick is that <i>he mixes science and magic</i>. I could easily make the robots powered not just by electricity, but also by magic; ditto the NTD. Heck, maybe this is all happening on some numerologically significant date, too. That'd make it much easier for Katar and possibly Chen to contribute in different ways.<br/><br/>I also need to re-think some of Katar's Aspects to give clearer indication of what to do with them.<br/><br/>And Chen, well, Chen is really not to useful in the scenario as-is. Pumping up the magic trappings will help, but I think I need to jigger some of his Aspects and Skills to make him a little more action-oriented. He also suffers a bit without Kato. In hindsight, with only five players, I'd have just eliminated him as a choice.<br/><br/>The other big thing is that I need to tighten up my introductory explanation of the rules a bit, and do a better job presenting Aspects. I printed out some double-sided cheat sheets; one side was Landon's rules summary, the other Brandon Amancio's Conflict Summary sheet. They got used mostly for my reference and so everyone could remember the steps of the ladder. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'll also definitely assign guest-star spots; less hemming and hawing that way.<br/><br/>In general, it was a great session, and when MUCH better than I had expected. Honestly, it was one of the most fun sessions I've ever had with this group. I don't think most of them want to play it again, but I did have them sold on finding a way to use Fate Points in our HERO game somehow.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm sold on SotC/FATE. I'd put it right by BWr and d20 as one of my all-time favorite systems.<br/><br/>So... next playtest in about 17 hours, this time with some he-man D&amp;D players!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71956/#Comment_71956" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T23:56:58+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 11:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, quick addenda:<br/><br/>1. 5 Fate Points per player was absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>2.

If you want to give someone a -1, you give their opposition a +1, that's it.<br/><br/>Also as written, spin doesn't have an effect on non-defenses, unless you have a stunt or some other situation that adds a "spin condition" into the mix.  <br/><br/>There's also no "I put a penalty on him and it just floats around unused" with the +1 from spin thing.

The rest of the stuff can be reactive, but the problem with a purely reactive character is that he'll end up being stuck/bored/useless in situations where his reactive stuff doesn't have something to react to (this sounds like the Kato/Chen problem, perhaps?).<br/><br/>That said, you CAN turn reactive characters into proactive characters by amping up their assessing and (more importantly) declarative angle.  Sure, your Mysteries dude might be hanging back with no combat skills to speak of (a problem, but not insurmountable) -- but if he's declaring all sorts of shit to be true, suddenly he's flooding the combat landscape with aspects that his allies can free-tag to improve their odds!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71976/#Comment_71976" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T08:37:56+00:00" title="May 26, 2007  8:37AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2007 8:38AM by iago.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>I'll also definitely assign guest-star spots; less hemming and hawing that way.<br/></blockquote>\nGive the phase 3 novels titles, to be certain.<br/><br/>Then use a formula that'll adapt to however many folks you get at the table: the two guest stars for your novel are the folks sitting to your right and your left.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>2.

I had just four players this time, with Kid Kato, Mac, Ace, and Uncle Chen in play. As we'll see, I probably should not have made Chen available, but the player seemed really psyched about using him, and I figured I'd take another go at trying to make him useful.<br/><br/>This group seemed to get the hang of Aspects much more readily than my Friday crew. They grokked the basic concept pretty easily, and had a blast coming up with new Aspects for the guest star phases (I had them take the novels of the person to their left and then right this time, which was a big time-saver). The big win here was that they were good about creating aspects that pointed to other characters. E.g., Mac added "Kid, behind you!" and Kid added, "I'm catching a ride, Ace!"<br/><br/>They also went nuts with the ape motif, so they added lots of monkey-focused aspects. Seeing this, I modified the robot minions to be hybrid robot-ape minions so there could be more monkey-fu getting thrown around.<br/><br/>So, this time around, the main spheres of play were:<br/><br/>Kid Kato jumping out of the zeppelin after Dr. M. There was lots of kung-fu-on-a-biplane action, and a daring leap by the Kid off the plane after Dr. M had both turned it invisible and leap out himself so he could use his parachute. I made it a Legendary simple contest that the Kid managed to hit via some Fate and his acrobatics stunt.<br/><br/>Ace flying out of the cupola to go and disable the zeppelin's "rudder" and veer it away from the Woolworth building. Ace made a cool Engineering declaration by invoking his The Goddard Family Name aspect to state that the zeppelin was a model his family business had designed, so he knew of one key weak spot near the tail. I tempered this a bit with Dr. M making a basic declaration with Mysteries that the zeppelin has obviously been modified and Did Not Work How You Think It Did.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72015/#Comment_72015" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T23:11:22+00:00" title="May 26, 2007 11:11PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mac running up to the nose of the airship to try and disable the NTD. His Human Spider helped him avoid a lot of the borders involved in moving around the interior.<br/><br/>Uncle Chen facing off against the robo-apes. As you might expect, this didn't really go so well, though it seems like it's pretty hard for Minions with minimal access to Fate Points to really do that much harm to a PC on their own. Chen managed to blow one of them away, but we eventually got to a point where the last robo-ape was the only issue left to deal with, so we kind of hand-waved it away given it was about stopping time.<br/><br/>The feedback I got from the players:<br/><br/><b>It'd be more fun to have a master villain that has a chance of being defeated.</b> Kid Kato's player felt frustrated that the big villain in the scenario was so unbeatable. I didn't pull Dr. M out a quickly as I had with the Friday group, so Kato exerted a lot of effort trying to just beat him down, which is pretty dang hard one-on-one. He suggested I use a villain that, while tough, is defeat-able.<br/><br/><b>Needed a clear example up front of how inflicting stress works.</b> I didn't go into detail about inflicting stress, saving it for in-game. Unfortunately, I think that the players assumed Health was like hit points, and thus kept trying to just land hits. With Dr. M especially, generating enough stress to get to consequences is practically impossible.<br/><br/><b>There should have been passengers the villains could threaten.</b> A very good point. Without innocents on the line, there was little incentive not to leave the cupola asap and start trying to break the airship (or go after Dr. M). Add in some passengers, and suddenly things get more complicated.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72016/#Comment_72016" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T23:24:27+00:00" title="May 26, 2007 11:24PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The metal structure of the zeppelin should have been charged with electricity.</b> The computer engineer suggested this one. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Static electricity built up on the zeppelin due to the inclement weather. Basically, it would have been a nifty aspect to complicate moving around the interior of the airship, up by the NTD.<br/><br/><b>Assuming the addition of passengers (see above), the PCs needed more "heroic" aspects.</b> Basically, aspects that could be compelled to make them focus on protecting the passengers over just shooting up the badguys, and make hard choices.<br/><br/><b>The PCs should be aware of more of the NPCs aspects at the start.</b> Given the backstory is that they've fought Dr. M before, I should lay out more of their aspects at the get-go, thus encouraging more tagging and whatnot.<br/><br/>My thoughts:<br/><br/>I definitely see how having a plot device like Dr. M appear to be a badguy they might be able to defeat could be frustrating. I don't know why I kept him around as long as I did this time. Probably because with him gone, it's just a couple minions that are in their way, and what fun is that. I also love Dr. M's whole schtick, and his Ten Equations make for easy access to cool effects.<br/><br/>So, I figured a solution might be to have both Dr. M and a lieutenant + minions on board. My first choice for said lieutenant would be Gorilla Khan, as he's really cool and in keeping with the heavy "monkey" theme I seem to be going for. He also figures in at least two of the PC's backstories. <br/><br/>Dr. M then gets "demoted" to pure plot device. He's the one who's rigged up the zeppelin, and he's used his mathemagic to set up a force-field that separates himself from the rest of the cupola. I.e., he's at the controls, piloting the airship, and the PCs just plain can't get to him. The setup then changes to Dr. M wanting to go with the zeppelin into the past/future/whatever.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72017/#Comment_72017" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T23:37:00+00:00" title="May 26, 2007 11:37PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the scenario then becomes about:<br/><br/>* Dealing with Gorilla Khan and his ape thugs<br/>* Protecting the passengers<br/>* Deactivating the NTD, or<br/>* Finding a way to veer the airship off-course by some means other than the helm (since Dr. M is there and totally protected).<br/><br/>One thing I definitely need to figure out is that exactly can be done to deactivate the NTD. Mac was able to roll ridiculous shifts on his Engineering, so just pitting the PCs against some static difficulty to disable the NTD is just too blah.

He's invincible because he's immortal and all that, but that doesn't mean he can't feel the pain. Even better, it's a very interesting scene. "I give up, Uncle Chen! You can take me to the police. Anyway, I'll escape from any jail they put me in within a week! And there's nothing you can do about it. Even scientist-criminals have the right to a fair trial! Ja ja ja ja ja" or something like that.<br/><br/>In pulp, you should be able to beat the crap out of your opponents, and enjoy it. You're not demoting DM by doing so, you're just giving players what they want.
