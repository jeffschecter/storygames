Been thinking of using the Harrow Deck (calling it Tarokka though) instead of the Ravenloft Tarroka.<br/><br/>I too like the deck though could wish the artwork was a bit less "cartoonish".  The Tarokka deck is, alternatively, too caught up in older edition D&amp;D classes etc. at times.  Not a fatal flaw but just a bit jarring.  Been mulling which is more jarring (cartoonish art or "transmuter").<br/><br/>For IAWA, one could also simply let the card be the oracle and not "prescript", have player who draws it write the "one liner" right there and then.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241211/#Comment_241211" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T08:27:12+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  8:27AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>have player who draws it write the "one liner" right there and then.</blockquote> I dunno...

The Joshua A C Newman oracle rule (Objects of Desire, Events that adds pressure, or Poeple in Need in whatever combination) acts as a support against total catastrophe but I'm still not sure I'd do it.<br/><br/>There are people who will have an easier time reacting to pictures than text.<br/><br/>I think there may be creative panic if you draw the cards and then say "write a line of text to summarize the elements of this picture, evocatively, adhering to one of these categories: [JACN's categories]".<br/><br/>However, to draw four cards from the Harrow deck, like:<br/>The Teamster (wizard dude riding on the shoulders of an ogre, whipping him with an ugly flail)<br/>The Tangled Briar (skeleton hanging on stick, in a briar patch)<br/>The Snakebite (Wicked wizard dude, with a curved knife, dripping poison)<br/>The Publican (Cyclops, pouring beer)<br/><br/>It's pretty easy for me to look at those and see a situation. Like:<br/><br/>1.) The gnomes are clearing the briars to advance their empire, and have harnessed the ogres to do so. But some ogres are resisting, and Snakebite the assassin has been hired to take them down. The Publican, a cyclopian bartender, is attempting to cater to both populations while racial tensions rise and become volatile.<br/><br/>2.) Snakebite, a dark mage from the tangled briar, has decided to kill his long-time nemesis, the cyclopian bartender (who retired from adventuring to open the bar). His army of evil gnomes has risen, ready to destroy the good people. Their leader rides atop an enslaved ogre.<br/><br/>I think it requires a bit more reading into the elements, but the elements are also a lot freer and more open to interpretation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
