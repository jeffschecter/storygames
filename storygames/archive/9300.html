That's cool man, just keep rolling.  But I wonder what it is about this hobby that keeps our interest long after it SHOULD have subsided.  I offer myself up as an example.  I used to love gaming and I THINK I still do.  Problem is, I haven't gamed in quite a while.  Last game I played was Burning Wheel at a convention probably 2 years ago, and before that it was probably another good year.  But here\u2019s the deal, I'm still interested.  I still love hitting the forums occasionally and seeing what's being discussed and reading about new games or folks' AP.  Doesn't matter, the whole thing is still interesting to me.<br/><br/>Now, I mostly go through phases where I won't think much about it for a few months in a row and then I'll pass the book shelf and think man, I'm gonna get the guys together and we're gonna play some damn Burning Wheel!!!  And I'll get all jacked up and get back into checking the forums and stuff and then it slowly fades away again for a few months.  In the mean time I might glance at my Google Reader to see what subjects are popping up in the forums but mostly it sits by the way side.  Until that spark fires up again.<br/><br/>So what is it?  I know I can't be the only one, otherwise there would have been none of us for the Go Play crowd to rise up against and relegate to pariah status.  Since that movement I mostly keep to myself and just lurk around because I know my membership has been revoked.  But I totally understand the resentment from the Playing Crowd, so I just do my thing ya know, and read from the shadows.<br/><br/>But what is it?  Why not just let it go?  If you're not up to offering yourself up to martyrdom by chiming in publicly just whisper me.  But seriously, who else is out there and why are you even around this forum and reading this post?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206077/#Comment_206077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T11:58:14+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 11:58AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd consider saying, "Come for the games, stay for the people", but with some hobbies it's usually, "Come for the people, stay for the games, then lose the people and stay for the new people."<br/><br/>And of course, the memory of gaming, and more than that, the desire to game again.

And sadly, it's often about priorities among things we genuinely care about.  So to do something, you really genuinely have to want to do it more than any of the other things you care about.<br/><br/>That said, there is something to be said for momentum.  I find that when I get fired up about playing a specific game I really need to the group together within a few days.  We don't actually need to meet right a way but everyone needs to commit to a place and time otherwise I get distracted.  You might want to try that.  The next time you get fired up, run to your computer and send out an email setting a time and date right then and there.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206089/#Comment_206089" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T12:29:32+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 12:29PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>And yeah, I get all fired up about how I'm going to download the latest version of Inform and crank out a game.... and then I don't.</blockquote>Ha!

Sometimes I just wonder if it sticks with me simply because of just how much fun I <i>use</i> to have gaming.  I mean, just looking at a game shelf or seeing some dice makes me feel all jazzed up.  I honestly have an almost involuntary reaction towards these gaming artifacts, they just make me happy.  Once I had found the gaming forums online a few years ago, they started doing the same thing in a way.  Just hearing people talking about gaming sort of makes me happy for whatever reason.<br/><br/>And certainly its about priorities.  I mean, if REALLY wanted to be gaming I guess I could somehow make it happen through rigorous efforts towards scheduling, but I don't.  And there's tons of other reasons why it doesn't happen too.  But what blows my mind is not that I'm not making it happen....its that even without doing it I remain drawn to it.  At least to its periphery anyway.<br/><br/>You make a good point Jesse that this phenomenon isn't unique to gaming and I hadn't thought of that.  I've pretty much just examined the issue through my own lens.  But I can say that this phenomenon manifests more strongly with gaming than any of my other hobbies.  I mean I love to trout fish, play basketball, skeet shoot, hike and camp, etc. and those all come and go in phases....but none consume me the way RPGs do when the bug hits.  I know that's anecdotal but I often wonder what the reason is behind that.  Maybe there's some psychology wrapped up in there somewhere.  <br/><br/>I've thought of the sports analogy before as well and it just doesn't fit as well in my mind.  Don't get me wrong, I don't spend a lot of time watching or discussing sports but I can sort of see where people would get into it.  For one thing, sure, we can all play sports but very very few of us can play sports the way collegiate and professional athletes do and I understand that that's worth discussing.  But we can probably all play RPGs to a discussion worthy level (in our own niche anyway).  Although, I have to admit, sometimes when I used to listen to the Durham 3 I came away from it in much the same way I'd come away from a collegiate or professional sports game...thinking man those guys must be pretty awesome at gaming.  Speaking of which, where the hell did you guys go anyway?

I'd never tell a damn soul that I watched it but I'm sure I'd check it out.  I'd hate it, but I'd check it out.  I won't deny that I've downloaded a few actual play recordings from various folks across the internet to listen to while out in the field.

Focused, talented gamers using top-notch play aids, digital tables (Ooo! Microsoft table!), etc. i see HUGE product-placement and endorsement opportunities, in the play aids. And I see professional improv actors (or at least very good amateur actors) portraying roles with conviction and passion. No OOC joking around (or, at least, not until the credits are rolling), no sloppy mess tables with Cheetos and shit scattered all over them.<br/><br/>Heck, LARP (particularly boffer or Airsoft/Nerf/paintball) is ripe for being documented (or dramatized). Again, need good actors and some clever LARP plot authors, not to mention Top Notch, Grade AAA set designers, lighting, and costumers. Shit, I'd PAY to play is such a game, not even caring that I'd be on TV (though I might not pass muster on the audition). And, what the hell, get some cameo appearances by genre fiction actors--would you watch a Star trek LARP that had a cameo by Leonard Nemoy; or a fantasy LARP with a cameo by John Rhys-Davies? I would.<br/><br/>And don't forget the phat miniature gaming options--hardcore modelers and mini painters in epic battles (hehe, or Mechaton--LEGO endorsement, anyone?!?). Add in some nifty animation graphics, to show attacks hitting (or missing), AoE effects, etc. Hell, this is a REAL cool use of a Microsoft table.<br/><br/>Or even Magic and Pokemon, with camera views of each hand (or current hand) and the play table, and some overlay graphics to show the math (or whatever) that determines an attack (or whatever)--make it watchable without sound, like poker shows do.<br/><br/>And go ahead and toss in some animation shorts from WoW and other computer games, for shits and giggles. Interstitials, maybe.<br/><br/>See, I would watch that and NOT hide it. Well, except for maybe the card game shows, unless they're showing off some hot new thang I might want to play. but I see at least two major revenue streams and, easy, a ton of exposure for publishers, actors, and "pro gamers" like demoers and such.<br/><br/>Anyhow... sorry I got off-topic, but my geek pride was pricked.

Finding time during the day to lurk on forums is one thing, but taking honest to goodness free time that could be used for gaming and wasting it on watching gaming?

You can't watch RPGs on TV and if you could, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to.<br/>It might not be that weird though, because you can spend time talking about RPGs on forums and reading books without playing.<br/>I'm sure most people get enjoyment out of playlogs. The difference is they don't happen in real time so you won't sit and shout of excitement at your computer screen just as you won't when reading a book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206176/#Comment_206176" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T16:06:02+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  4:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            god knows I have listened to more than my fair share of the Penny Arcade Actual Plays (if you want to call them that )in podcast form<br/><br/>Good Times. <br/><br/>Logos<br/><br/>But you see that would be the beauty of rpgtv.

I think the biggest reason we come back is the ability to escape our own lives; or in some cases get a better handling on it. It is a creative outlet and an explosive one at that. Some of the problems I see that keep us from our beloved hobby is honestly the way our little sub culture is organized. <br/>\n If you think about it as previously mentioned given the creative nature of the hobby it is vitally important to keep the momentum up on a treadmill of imagination. Given the sparse nature of our likes, and the slowly failing business model of gaming stores we are for the most part slowly losing touch with our in person contacts. I think instead of focusing on gaming stores that are slowly crumbling, a better approach might be to start trying to organize a non game specific club that can cater to any gamers needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is just an analyses of my situation and little corner of the gaming world.<br/>\nRegards, Seth                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206446/#Comment_206446" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T01:28:28+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  1:28AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: daw65</cite><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>And how many of these people actually<i>play</i>the sports in question?</blockquote>\nDo things like fantasy football count here?<br/><br/>Fantasy football is to sports as Play-by-post is to RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206453/#Comment_206453" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T06:40:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  6:40AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Role-playing games are a challenging and fulfilling activity.
