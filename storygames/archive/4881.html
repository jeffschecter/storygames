Before, even though I'm a Japanophile (or at least can speak the language, my "love" is cornered to media, stationary, traveling and food), and even though I find the L5R setting not only bearable (the names and location names: BARELY. But still), but <i>awesome</i>, I have never run it for more than one session.<br/><br/>The reason, I realized, is that someone (or the group as a whole) has to set up a sandbox; a situation to which all the players jump in, make characters, and resolve.  If you don't, and all players come to the table with a Crane Archer, a Crab Shadowlands Zombie Hunter, a Lion Noble Warrior, a Phoenix Shugenja, and a Dragon Shaolin Monk... FUCK. The GM will have to do some major work to get them together, do phenomenal work every second in order for them not to run and tear each other apart, and then, I dunno, present basically FedEx quests until the campaign is over. At least, that was my thought.<br/><br/>Recently, I've had a thought to ignore all the bizarre CCG-seeped voluminous history of people, events and shit (well, was planning on doing that anyway) and use the 1st edition as a clean slate: And have basically a campaign where most of the players are Scorpions attempting to regain their domain, with one character from another clan (for spice). The situation would be a behind-the-scenes setup and takedown, focusing on key members of other clans. Mostly social, some fighting. <br/><br/>I wanted to toss the idea out there, and make a thread where people in the know of L5R (any edition) could possibly toss in a one-paragraph situation.<br/><br/>Also, and this is a side-question: If anyone out there has 1st ed and 3rd edition, is there any reason to get 3rd edition? What is "better" about it, if anything?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109517/#Comment_109517" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T22:51:44+00:00" title="November 24, 2007 10:51PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another situation:<br/><br/>All PCs (except, and this might be the Andy Spice Technique: One PC is from another clan, for spice) are in the Crab Clan. The great wall protecting the territories from the shadowlands... falls. The head of the clan and his highest retainers were last seen standing atop a small mountain of zombie and ogre corpses, holding out while the Crab flee their ancestral homelands into the other realms.<br/><br/>That's the setup. What happens from there is up to the PCs.  There's probably problems for the PCs and the 10,000 refugees following them, being allowed into neighboring kingdoms and accepted.<br/><br/>There will have to be efforts to build a second wall, far behind the first, which blocks off the Crablands from the rest of the empire.<br/><br/>There will be more struggles as the Crab clan struggles to integrate (or decidedly non-integrate) into the societies of the countries that adopt them.<br/><br/>The crab ambassadors to other clans regularly write the other ambassadors, keeping a running tally of Clan issues, refugee issues, refugee status, etc.  Suddenly, contact with the crab ambassador of the Dragon clan is cut. Upon investigation, the crab refugees in the Dragon clan have all completely disappeared.<br/><br/>If a longer campaign, then the PCs could find a way to fund and power an effort to regain the Crab ancestral homelands, perhaps making some cruddy deals in the process (sign a pact: the clan who helps hold the Crab castle for a month and a day will be allowed to take control of that castle, and its city; arranged marriages of Crab princesses, etc. Anything to get back the homeland). During the early stages of the battle, some of the soldiers on the front line return with stories; They swear they heard the voice of the Crab clan leader barking orders from the mists... and the zombies and ogres seem to follow formations that the Crab have historically used...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109558/#Comment_109558" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T10:43:13+00:00" title="November 25, 2007 10:43AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andy,<br/><br/>I ran a cracking good L5R (3e) game a couple years back. <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=224340" rel="nofollow">L5R Actual Play</a><br/><br/>I'll admit up front the 3rd ed rules left us all cold, and you can PM if you want specific details on that, but as for the situation, I pitched the idea of all the characters being from one clan (or two allied clans).

The first problem being that they did a lot to fiddle with the numbers, but didn't give any advice on how the TNs would change compared to the first two editions.   The second problem is that the book lays out the massive timeline of L5R events, but in a very "Forgotten Realms" kind of way- all of the good color stories and such basically had disappeared.   This helped contribute to a lot of problems dealing with setting and canon if only because I never kept up with the card game metaplot and the players now had tons and tons of setting in their heads which I wasn't really interested in using.<br/><br/>As far as the Crab clan idea- awesome.  Are the PCs starting out higher than 1st rank?  Only because 1st rank really makes characters sorta competant, and they usually lack the Glory to really command others.   <br/><br/>The other thing to think about with ALL L5R editions is how you want to handle Honor- is it strictly based on the what the chart says, or is it based on what is "really" honorable?  This can set up some interesting situations where you have bastards who order their own children on suicide missions who are super honorable and true saints with Honor 1.  If you choose to go with what's really honorable, I suggest tossing the whole honor chart and doing it like Sorcerer's Humanity checks- state two or three themes of what is honor and reward/remove accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109576/#Comment_109576" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T13:12:55+00:00" title="November 25, 2007  1:12PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/><br/>   Upon first reading of the original post, my thoughts were: Buy City of Lies boxed set.

So, let me throw a situation at you based on your idea:<br/><br/>Once the wall has fallen, a contingent of Crab and ratlings fight their way into the Shadowlands to try to split the attention of their enemies and buy some time for their clan.  They find a long lost Crab castle and take it over.  Now they're sitting in the middle of the Shadowlands in one of their ancestral homes, slowly succumbing to the taint, but refusing to leave.  The PCs are sent to the castle to either supply them or bring them home or bring home something they've found.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning" title="gamera_spinning"><img alt="gamera_spinning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/280/n8IY31021JMRT.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning">gamera_spinning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109641/#Comment_109641" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T08:31:03+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  8:31AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinly related, I'll admit, but yesterday my girlfriend was reading a website called <a href="http://www.immortalgeisha.com/faq_misc.php#faq07" rel="nofollow">Immortal Geisha</a> that a friend of hers runs, and I was fascinated <a href="http://gamera-spinning.livejournal.com/1426219.html" rel="nofollow">watching a video on the application of Shiro Nuri (white face paint) used by the Meiko and Geiko of Gion and Kabuki actors</a>.

The worst ones had no clan focus and the group lacked cohesion.  So you're certainly on the right track there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI briefly ran a PbP game on rpg.net called Crosswinds, featuring the five children of Emperor Toturi- the five noncanonical children.<br/>\n(The wiki for it is here: http://crosswinds.pbwiki.org/ )<br/>\n<br/>\nA few things I learned:<br/>\n<br/>\nScrewing around with canon is crazy fun.  Put your own spin on things, change it, spindle it, and mutilate it.  If you're familiar with canon events, change a key one, and see how things change.  It's fascinating for those who are familiar with it, and puts players who aren't on a leveler playing field.  And you can always say, "my rokugan is like this."<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong those lines, killing major/canon NPCs is really carthartic.  In your Crab example, I'd kill off the Crab daimyo, and most of his/her family.  The Crab rulership stands empty, and the acts of heroes will determine the future leadership of the clan.  (If your players don't want high-level adventure, they can be key supporters for a new Clan head and get intrigue there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI find 3rd ed much more interesting than 1st- run it out of the core book, avoid supplement bloat, and keep your Rokugan simple.  Award more xp than the book suggests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109802/#Comment_109802" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T07:53:11+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  7:53AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all, thanks for the comments (whew, busy week).<br/><br/>Some responses:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>I ran a cracking good L5R (3e) game a couple years back.</blockquote>\nYeppers, I remember hearing that podcast between you and Cam, and your "lukewarm" comments: The system was managable, but didn't really do much to turn up the awesome (in terms of forcing people to do/experience cultural things, etc). Also, I hear you on the place names. I was considering how much less it would have grated on me, looking at the map, if their J-guy knew the word for "mountain range" (sanmyaku). But I digress, and take it in stride, as it's basically the opposite of what I see when I look at Western-themed Japanese RPGs ("Atrantic Ocean", "Town of Mermaid" etc).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>The first problem being that they did a lot to fiddle with the numbers, but didn't give any advice on how the TNs would change compared to the first two editions.</blockquote>\nAh.  I hear you on that, I heard that there were a lot of broken tables and stuff like that, too. Which is a shame because it's an otherwise pretty book.<br/><br/>Also, yeah, I took a look at it at Barnes and Noble a while back, and realized that those 40 pages of "what happened in the CCG world with characters who are more awesome than you" would be realistically ignored, metaphorically torn out of the book and thrown into the sun.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>As far as the Crab clan idea- awesome.  Are the PCs starting out higher than 1st rank?  Only because 1st rank really makes characters sorta competant, and they usually lack the Glory to really command others.</blockquote>\nI'm not back-and-forth on the Glory stuff (though I read how to gain/lose it, how only the Emperor has "10", and just not what it <i>does</i>). I'll have to look into that.  I was also thinking of making the PCs around 1st or 2nd rank, and as Willow suggests, awarding way more XP.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite><br/>The other thing to think about with ALL L5R editions is how you want to handle Honor- is it strictly based on the what the chart says, or is it based on what is "really" honorable?</blockquote>\nInteresting. I've been watching a lot of samurai-era films lately, and one thing I can't get over is that there is a real honor which people inately know that is good and honorable, and you've got this "face honor", which is pretty much seeped in real machismo: The samurai turning his back on his family for his lord is "honorable", and in the boys' club of the samurai elite he gets mad props and slaps on the back, but the townsfolk spit on the ground when he walks past and noble courtiers talk about him behind his back. That sort of thing. The honor system as written would be awesome: It totally plays up the machismo honor, and leaves the characters making choices: "Do I side with the humble *real* honorable guy who does the right thing, or do I engage in "honor politiking" to increase my own status"?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>Upon first reading of the original post, my thoughts were: Buy City of Lies boxed set.

Also, I might have to check for myself through reviews, but are there major rules changes over the roll-and-keep of 1st? Also, totally going with the avoiding supplement bloat.  At one time I owned or read most of the core clanbooks, but there was really little I gained from them (bought on eBay, sold back on eBay), and to this day I don't remember much about them.<br/><br/>Also, anyone have a nascent idea of a situation focusing on Unicorn, Phoenix, or (especially) Dragon?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109806/#Comment_109806" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T08:10:44+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  8:10AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your Crab clan campaign idea.

It requires buy-in to one maybe-controversial idea:<br/><br/>The L5R setting, at least as it has been presented to me, is really close to "Japanese Imperialism, the RPG." I don't say this in a super-negative way (basically all western-produced Samurai stuff is centered in early 20th century Japanese imperialism), although I realize it's hard to talk about facists on the internet without making people flinch. But basically, you have the "pure" lands of Rokugan and then there are the "Shadowlands" to the south and west (where Korea and China are, natch) which are corrupt and the source of all evil in Rokugan.<br/><br/>Okay, so what do we do with this? Well, let's take it at face value. Let's say that most of Rokugani culture and values and such actually *come from* the Shadowlands, particularly in the court. They write their books in Shadowlands characters (kanji), they practice Shadowlands religions (buddhism and confucianism), and they even lay out their cities like Shadowlands cities (this is also historical to early imperial period.)<br/><br/>So you play a bunch of hick Samurai lords going for the first time in generations to swear your fealty to the Emporer. You show up at court and find all this decadence and decay and corruption being openly displayed. The poets write poems in Shadowlands style! The calligraphers draw Shadowlands characters! The emporer himself flirts with Shadowlands religion! Maybe his favorite concubine is a princess from the Shadowlands, brought back as tribute from a Crab conquest. What do you do? Do you swear allegiance to a corrupt emporer and, if you do, what does that entail?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109819/#Comment_109819" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T08:47:03+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  8:47AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Andy,<br/><br/>The Pheonix are easiest to work with.  Not only do you get all the tradtiional samurai values, you get magic, which opens up to all the cliched stuff of magic, forbidden magic, magic gone wrong, people stealing ideas, etc.  But you also have a neat thing about trying to make peace, which kind of opens the door for anything from DitV style "fix this town" things to major politics.  You could even have a secret conspiracy to -make peace- which then opens the doors for all the usual ethical questions- is it ok to kill one person to stop a war that will kill thousands?  Etc.<br/><br/>The Unicorn are pretty badly tacked on, and if anything seem like the writers' excuse to shove Duncan McCleod into their faux Japan.   You'd think after a few centuries where they've crossed continents they'd figure out how to adapt to the culture and politics of their home country, right?   So then the question becomes are they just super isolated or are they mostly normal AND just painted as foreign (see, "racism").  Are they an "untouchable" samurai clan that no one knows what to do with?   There's some possible neat stuff in that.<br/><br/>But more interesting, what happens if they get enough acceptance that their internal divisions begin to break loose?  You have the L5R version of arabic, western, and mongol cultures turned samurai at war with each other- you do the awesome.<br/><br/>The Dragon are the hardest to work with, if only because they're the most  exotified, bullshit ass clan in the game.  The summary basically comes up to "Be oh-ree-en-tal, be mysterious, be zen", you know, without any actual writings on the ideas of zen buddhism.  So you have a fortune cookie phrase-spouting guy with 2 swords who never has to justify doing random and weird shit.  Pretty much to get anything out of the clan, you have to put something in, something that humanizes or makes them actual people.<br/><br/>Maybe people just -expect- them to have answers, in which case, you have the DitV kind of thing again.  Or perhaps more interesting, they're given some concepts, ideas, or koans and some physical mission and they're expected to contemplate the ideas and how they apply/don't apply during the quest.

I can't completely tell by your description above. I'd be comfortable, "throwing the horns" even, with having the Shadowlands be a place of zombie and evil and taint... which still, far into it, has the Chinese-analogue culture where Rokugan gets its writing, official religion etc. In other words, a China swamped with the evil Shadowlands junk that makes them undeniably evil... and yet the Rokugani have adapted so much of their culture from the Shadowlands in the past, too much to divorce themselves of (perhaps a "before the corruption" Shadowlands, when the land was called "Nakaguni" or something, wink). That sets up all sorts of cool issues, like the Crab adopting a different alphabet and being skeptical of Shadowlands-born Buddhism, etc. <br/><br/>But I'd be really uncomfortable, I think, playing out the Shadowlands as a China-Korea analogue without the evil and taint. Too much junk bottled up in there. I don't want to replay on the table the most shameful parts of jingoism in human history, thanks. But add in the "they happen to have been swamped with evil when some shadowy emporer took the throne", that would work well I think. (likewise, I can see at some point being in a QIN game set in the era when a "Shadowlands Mori Motonari and his evil noble skull squad" stomps up and down the coasts of China, requiring to be defeated... at any cost! etc.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>The Unicorn are pretty badly tacked on, and if anything seem like the writers' excuse to shove Duncan McCleod into their faux Japan.</blockquote>\nYeah, I too can't really build a real mental image of how they're supposed to be different, yet not reviled. They're great horsemen, they have higher karakuri-style tech and the like... but nothing really with teeth. I might have to awesome-ify the setting by making them Ainu analogues, with all the baggage that carries (as the "Indians of Japan"... yet come up with a reason why they aren't simply hunted and driven off).<br/><br/>Or else make the Unicorn an entire culture altogether: They happen to be people who left a faux-Arabia to the north, settled into the region, and miraculously quickly picked up the language and writing. Yet have their own beliefs, art, etc. In other words, instead of Japanese who left to Arabia and returned, make them settlers from Arabia who came in and filled a hole opened in some kind of succession-war. That might work while still sticking to the idea/mystique of the setting (not trusted because they're different, yet embraced for their power and resourcefulness, etc).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>The Dragon are the hardest to work with</blockquote>\nYeah. The thing that bites is that they're so mysterious, for mysteriousness-sake. I'd probably either change their region into a shifting dreamlands ala the Wilds in Exalted, or else make them pretty much exactly like the Fire Nation of Avatar: They're mysterious behind-the-scenes, but clearly ruthless and gunning for that throne.<br/><br/>Interesting. I might have to Awesome-ify the setting a little bit to make it my own.

I knew going in that it was going to be Unicorn centric, and in my backstory, my mother fell in love with my Dragon father and then she fell in battle saving his ass.  I was brought up from a young age, knowing I was going to go serve the Unicorn as honorable payback for my mum's service to the Dragon.  <br/><br/>...and fell right into a wonderfully supportive Shinjo Shoji court.  I play my Dragon as a young man from mountains, but with an open, curious mind.... and being among the sorta well-traveled "mongol analogues" has worked really well.  Get to play fish out of water, but not stupid.<br/><br/>Now it looks like the campaign might morph into more Dragon oriented stuff due to other players coming in with Dragon players, but I will still continue to serve the Unicorn and be "lent" back to the Dragon to help with their problems.<br/><br/>And for what it is worth:  I find that Crab idea of holding the wall about as boring of an idea I could possibly think of to do in L5R.  Sorry.  Crab do nothing for me.  The shadowlands feels like tacked on excuse for d&amp;disms.  <br/><br/>My GM has  a great way of describing the Scorpion... they are the most honest folks in Rokugan, because they wear their masks openly.  Scorps are NOT the bad guys in this game, not the ninjas... Just too easy, Just too easy to suspect.  Just too cliche'd.  If my Dragon ever retires or dies... I really want to be a Scorpion... and play with that idea of being the most honest and straightforward clans.<br/><br/>Our Unicorn are a bit more like the Mongol...but their major power is wealth.. and my GM does a great job of showing that in game.  ...and I've made big strides to say that Rokugan owes more to China than to Japan... and I think that has seeped in.  I mean, c'mon... Japan is an island.  Rokugan is shaped like China (shadowlands being Malaysia natch, great desert analogy works etc).  Suddenly the Hare and Mantis and Unicorn make a whole lot more sense if you look at the like crazy quiltwork of sects in Chinese kung fu comics and movies (Blood Sword Dynasty).... just filtered through an odd feudal system with trappings of the samurai...which really come down to the name of the swords as far as I can see... ... okay, that might be overstatting the simplicity of it all... but really erase Katana and switch it with Jian... and you are pretty much good to go.

I've been watching a lot of samurai-era films lately, and one thing I can't get over is that there is a real honor which people inately know that is good and honorable, and you've got this "face honor", which is pretty much seeped in real machismo: The samurai turning his back on his family for his lord is "honorable", and in the boys' club of the samurai elite he gets mad props and slaps on the back, but the townsfolk spit on the ground when he walks past and noble courtiers talk about him behind his back. That sort of thing. The honor system as written would be awesome: It totally plays up the machismo honor, and leaves the characters making choices: "Do I side with the humble *real* honorable guy who does the right thing, or do I engage in "honor politiking" to increase my own status"?<br/>-Andy<br/><br/>IMO, any honor system you come up with <i>will</i> serve you better than the L5R system (I'm speaking of 3e here, never saw the previous versions). Again IMO, the system as written is not only needlessly fiddly, it really has little impact on anything. It's tucked away in the middle of the book and only gets a couple of pages - contrast with the lists of weapons and clan abilities and kewl powerz and you get an idea of what you're really going to see affecting things in play, mechanically speaking.<br/><br/>I dunno, if I were gonna do fantasy Japan again, I wouldn't use L5R, or at the very least, I wouldn't set it Rokugan.<br/><br/>That said, some of the campaign ideas coming up in here are pretty cool (Tatooine moisture farmers...heh!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110779/#Comment_110779" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T14:51:14+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  2:51PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>I dunno, if I were gonna do fantasy Japan again, I wouldn't use L5R, or at the very least, I wouldn't set it Rokugan.</blockquote>\nHuh. If only there were a game on the horizon where you could play a fantasized Japan, using a different system... :-)<br/><br/>Actually, I had considered using Tenra Bansho to play L5R, but I was actually thinking I want to play a 5-8 session game (rather than Tenra's "one full campaign per game session" methodology)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131102/#Comment_131102" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T01:31:10+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:31AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first L5R campaign (which I GM'd) revolved around a group of Emerald Magistrates on the borders of the Unicorn and Scorpion lands (though I don't think we ever went to Ryoko Owari). They slowly uncovered a plot to murder the Emperor, conducted in the spirit realm by corrupt Lion Shugenja. The climax of the campaign (which went on for about a year as I remember) was a massive battle in the spirit realms between corrupted lion spirits and honorable dead.<br/><br/>My second campaign (which I was a player in) was set in the border lands North East of the Phoenix, where they mix with non-rokugani savages. All the characters were exiles, their family names tarnished by various relatives dabblings in Maho, who had been given a chance to regain their honor far from civilized lands (though they were not expected to do so). They became tangled in a plot between savage wyrm riders and the living shadow, which had great potential to allow them to redeem themselves, except that one character sold out to the shadow and murdered the Shugenja leading the ritual to cast the corrupted ones out of the Phoenix border lands. The rest of the campaign was about her disgraced friends going ronin and hunting her down.<br/><br/>I also ran a medium sized and length (20-30 players, 2 years duration) monthly L5R LARP set in the lands of the Mongoose and Dragonfly (nestled between Phoenix and Dragon) some very minor clans with big ambitions. Almost all the characters in that game were from minor clans.<br/><br/>Can I also recommend the L5R-2k setting that Rich Wulf wrote as a fan before he joined the company, which moved the whole of Rokugan forward into a setting of cyberpunk style sci-fi-magic with Lion mecha and flying Crab castles, it rocks! I ran three or four one-off LARPS at Conpulsion in Edinburgh set in R2k and they were great.<br/><br/>Finally to make the Unicorn more cool take a look at the fiction written about them for Legend of the Burning Sands, much more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
