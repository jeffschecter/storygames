We were playing D&amp;D (Labyrinth Lord AEC to be precise) and we found a covered glass surface that we guessed was a mirror. We didn't look into the mirror. We strapped it on our "dungeonator" -- a siege wagon 10 foot wide that we had invented to use in the dungeon to fight skeletons --  and way later, extra-diegetical hours [that is to say, the clock on the wall in the playing room, not the hourglasses our player characters were using in the magical realm] had passed and we were on our way home to the City of Helix. We suddenly had to fight giant toad monsters!! We uncovered the mirror and one toad monster looked in it and burst like a bubble. The mirror cracked.<br/><br/>The exact same thing could've happened in a No Myth game where the DM made up things from their own imagination on the fly. They could've seen that we were scared of the mirror and after we revealed it to the toad monsters, "rewarded" us by giving it a harmful one-time effect on our foes. This was so cool so that when I got home I immediately called my own mom (for the record, we speak like six times a year or so so it's not like I'm a huge momma's girl) and told her the story.<br/><br/>As a middle ground, the mirror could've had an effect from a random table, rolled as we discovered it or as we uncovered it. This would still have been way way cooler than the DM making it up because the DM making it up makes us feel not free.<br/><br/>As it turns out, the DM has assured me that the mirror and it's effect were pre-placed on the dungeon map according to the module. To me this was amazing. The dungeon felt like a toy box. Like a real dungeon. The game as a whole -- rules, module, group, DM, dice -- together felt like a meaningful system, a system that stretched over both diegetic and extra-diegetic parts (that is to say, a "clock" where some  "gears" were in the magical land and some "gears" were around the playing table).<br/><br/>Why is it so awesome that the mirror was placed in advance.<br/>Why is it not awesome to make up such a mirror effect on the spot.<br/><br/>I have never railroaded (that is to say, have a pre-planned outcome or story written down and guided play to fit that pre-written story) but I have ran a lot, a lot, a lot of No Myth in my life. This experience with the mirror shocked my core and I became a believer in Full Myth at once.<br/>Why is that?<br/><br/>Looking at external behaviours, we players are hearing and saying and doing the exact same things.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446380/#Comment_446380" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T20:04:01+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  8:04PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 8:04PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll have to respond in more detail later, but the first thing that comes to mind is a counter-example of sorts: it was Tod (<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf%29">@AsIf)</a> 's story about a Lady Blackbird game he ran which had a dragon trapped in a cage. The players figured out that they could use the dragon's breath (or something like that) to refuel the Owl and make their escape.<br/><br/>They were thrilled at how perfectly the pieces fit together and that they had figured it out - a very high-level puzzle which must have been planned carefully from the start, with all the pieces in place.<br/><br/>The way Tod tells the story, he didn't have the heart to tell them he'd improvised the whole thing and thrown in the dragon on a whim at the end.<br/><br/>Moral of the story?

I think this is like me asking, "Why do people like beer? I can't stand it. I prefer wine." It's a matter of taste.<br/><br/>I love games on all parts of the No-Myth to Full-Myth spectrum, though! So maybe I can help you understand what I like about <del>Full Myth</del> No Myth, anyway.<br/><br/>To enjoy <del>Full Myth</del> No Myth, you have to care about things other than "this is real." That's all. When I play Fiasco, I don't care that we're making up everything as we go. I only care that the story we're creating a) makes a modicum of sense, and b) entertains us. I know that the Fiasco rules are going to deliver high drama, painful tragedy, dark comedy, and a few hours of solid fun. Fiasco doesn't even have a GM to "own" all the <del>Myth</del> setting and stuff, right? All issues of authority over the setting and characters are worked out at the table, without any rules, really. And it just works.<br/><br/>Well, for me. You might not enjoy that kind of play.

"No Myth" is supposed to mean a game where there is no "myth", the content is just being winged by whatever means. Sandra is using the terminology correctly, I think, and I at least understood immediately what she meant.<br/><br/>Just like Adam, I am very fond of both ends of the myth spectrum and everything in between. A game like say <a href="https://www.patreon.com/doctorxaos?ty=h" rel="nofollow">Doctor Xaos</a> (which we've been playing here recently) or <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is utterly minimalistic no myth design where everything there is to the game's scenario comes flying out of the frontal lobes of the players in whatever ugly or beautiful form it might take. Full Myth is great as well, I absolutely love having the firm and uncompromising truth of the scenario at my back when GMing e.g. D&amp;D, as it provides me with a hygienic, immaculate immunity to doubt and self-censure as a referee - I'm not the one deciding on the lives and deaths, it's all in the Notes.<br/><br/>Because you asked, Sandra, I'd hazard that the reason for why you like Full Myth better than No Myth could simply be that you've happened to encounter stronger games from one of the spectrum than the other. The way you describe having yourself ran a lot of No Myth feels familiar to me, as I started GMing that way as a youth, and sort of burned out on it, only regaining interest with more advanced Forgite techniques that still generally kept to the low end of the Myth spectrum, but simply made for more interesting games. I could imagine myself thinking that Full Myth wasn't for me, sort of opposite to your idea, if I hadn't delved into old school D&amp;D over the last decade.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe it's just the joy of discovering something new. I know that I was crazy happy for several years after I cracked the D&amp;D code, couldn't get enough of the stuff. As we grow older, that feeling of fresh discovery and sense of wonder gets lamentably rare. So maybe Full Myth is so awesome because it's new (to you). This sentiment certainly reflects the joy some people have felt in the reverse situation, when they discover the effortless freedoms and opportunities of No Myth after being stifled by a tradition that emphasized the opposite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446400/#Comment_446400" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T21:50:41+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  9:50PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Full Myth" makes sense if you take it in the sense of "There's a fully worked out mythology behind the places we visit" rather than the "The prior existence of the things we invent is fully a false myth". Which may be a bit misleading, though I can't at the moment think of a better term to describe a fully prepped gestalt.<br/><br/>If I had to stab at a guess, the pleasure of Full Myth/Consistency-in-Detailed-Prep/Living-in-a-world comes from the sense of agency you get that your actions meant something: that you could have chosen differently. <br/><br/>Having the consistency in the world means that your diegetic choices in-fiction mean something, whereas if the in-fiction diegetic choice was actually decided by the metafictional choice of your GM making an extra-diegetic choice to reward your characters' diegetic caution.<br/><br/>I think it can work on different aspects of the game, too: For a game where you care deeply about the position of objects in space, working out a detailed floor plan for the dungeon is probably conducive to this, for a game about character relationships, a detailed relationship map will help.<br/><br/>I do find that, as a player, I want to be sure that the rules of the space we're playing in are followed, depending on the game. Fiasco or Microscope are all about making stuff up. But in Burning Wheel I want you to hit me with those Resource tests for my lifestyle maintenance. And in Dungeon World I don't want to be able to give aid to my friend if I'm already diegetically preoccupied and too far away--I want the GM to enforce some limits.<br/><br/>On the other side, as a GM...personally, I like AW Fronts, because they're at just the right balance for my tastes between I-planned-this-future-thing and I-need-to-be-flexible-for-the-players.<br/><br/>Hypothesis: No-myth pushes the collaborative rewarding-of-decisions into the group space.

It was one particular Player who was crestfallen.  I might add that this is a person who is highly meticulous, a little obsessive, with a very strong "left brain" (mathematics, statistics), with very little experience at tabletop but lots of experience in MMORPGs.  He wanted it to have been a "No Myth" experience.<br/><br/>To be precise about my personal druthers: I like it all.  For instance: My AD&amp;D world is a gigantic library of maps, charts, histories, it's Full Myth.  I do maybe 2-4 hours of prep for every hour of play (sometimes crazymuch more, for days on end, without a session in sight).  I've posted before about how I even went about creating cultural and linguistic geneologies - I run AD&amp;D with the Myth Pedal pushed to the floor.  When I run a one-shot module for a group involving newbies I usually run in this mode as well.<br/><br/>But when I run AW or DayTrippers, I ease up on the Myth Pedal about halfway.<br/><br/>When I run Lady Blackbird or Everyone is John, I ease up on the pedal all the way.<br/><br/>It's fun to drive different types of vehicles.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446409/#Comment_446409" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T23:17:21+00:00" title="July 13, 2015 11:17PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fang Langford coined the term "No Myth Gamemastering" in this 2003 post: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=6275" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=6275</a><br/><br/>As a question - I have a possibly bigger topic about the difference between improvised and prepared content, and a bunch other.

A lot of RPG discussion that I find online is either with people that I completely agree with (and don't have much to add) or completely disagree (and get ignored/misinterpreted when I try to say anything).</i><br/><br/>I've played both a lot of Full and No Myth and I've always loved the possibility of improvising a story during play (as opposed to reading Fighting Fantasy books or playing videogames). However, throughout the years, I've learned the difference between improvising by myself and improvising with others. In the first approach, I'm not any sort of genius so I really have to prep in order to improvise (meaning, I prime myself with inspirational media, write down random ideas, make lists of things, etc.). In the second approach, I need to rely on others that might learn and play the game with me (instead of me just running the game to the point where I almost play with myself).<br/><br/>I'm not particularly excited with extensive world building or with memorizing a pre-built scenario (although I've done both many times). I am excited about learning who your character is and finding cool interesting questions that bring him or her to life. I also find it fair that both of us have the power to make this session awesome or a very dull affair. In my opinion, since Full Myth separates the characters in play from the fully pre-defined setting, the players have less agency than with a No Myth game where the story is born out of who the characters are, want and do. <br/><br/>However, I also know that a lot people are not nearly as excited as I am about improvising a story together. Maybe they prefer solving puzzles. Maybe they are used to having the story come to them. Maybe it's not fun to run the risk of setting up a conflict that you yourself also have to resolve.<br/><br/>The thing is, improvising with others only works for real if you have a good game and people who want to learn and play it. If you show up with your fresh copy of Night Witches and everybody goes "idunno" to all the questions, there's not much of a game there. On the other hand, your standard Full Myth D&amp;D can power through all the "idunno"s as there is a bunch of pre-made content to engage with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446440/#Comment_446440" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T12:52:35+00:00" title="July 14, 2015 12:52PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had kind of an "idunno" reaction to Hillfolk; but we skimped on the world building questions too much.<br/><br/>Let me clarify that having a prepared scenario, plotline or sequence of events is not what I have on the table at all.

The whole thing is basically a lie.   No matter how thoroughly you prep it, it's NOT A WORLD.  Maybe you can put in enough prep to fake it (Hence "Myth") but often you can't, because good god, players. :P  Sooner or later you're going to need to extrapolate from what you've written down, which is EXACTLY THE SAME as extrapolating from stuff you just made up five minutes ago.  Or you're going to have to reveal that it's all actually just painted set dressing and they think they're attacking the Real Rock Ridge but they're actually attacking the Fake Rock Ridge.<br/><br/>You can do your best to play "full myth" but it's still a myth.  It's still not real.  It's still not complete.  Writing stuff down doesn't make it more real.  And, as has been pointed out by your very own example, 2097, a well run "No Myth" game is functionally indistinguishable from a well run "Myth" game.  The only difference is in the minds of the players and when the GM has to put in their work. <br/><br/>As a result, I think this discussion should be, frankly, irrelevant to players.  They should assume whatever makes them happy.  GMs can argue this if they want, but once again, the choice comes down to "whatever helps you sleep at night" and "Whatever is easier for you to run" moreso than any difference in the actual game experience.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a psychological trick.  It's like telling someone an object is "one of a kind" even when it's not to make them like it more.  You'd better hope they never check out antiques roadshow or something.<br/><br/>The best games are where the players and GM agree on what kind of game is being run, just so no one gets their feelings hurt, but that's the only benefit I see.  I think it probably says something that "No myth" players are almost universally willing to wink and nod and say "Oh, of COURSE it's all real, Oh Great Game Master." but "Myth" players seem to feel wounded and betrayed if they see behind the curtain.  I'm not sure what it says, but I'm sure it tells us something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446457/#Comment_446457" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T14:43:11+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  2:43PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, surely the GM's feelings matter, too?

For example, in old school D&amp;D I absolutely <i>must</i> trust that the GM is not cheating behind the screen. Even uncertainty about it causes my play motivation to deteriorate, I withdraw from committing seriously to the challenges and start half-assing it. "Oh I guess I'll go wrestle with that giant, let's see if the GM has the balls to kill me." This is admittedly something of a paradoxical conundrum for refereed challenge-based more-or-less Full Myth play, as the GM cannot prove their fidelity by revealing their scenario without ruining the fog of war, but we make do with GM affirmations (as in, the GM periodically talks about their continuing commitment to fair and objective refereeing), occasional overview (e.g. a player not involved in an important situation checks over the GM's dice rolls and notes), post-action procedural checks (i.e. the GM explains what it was all about later) and just generally trusting each other to not cheat because we're friends and what would be the point.<br/><br/>As a general issue of social philosophy I find that treating other people as objects you play psychological tricks upon runs afoul of Immanuel Kant's golden rule, which is a big deal for me, as I was a huge fan of Kant through my teenage years <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446458/#Comment_446458" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T14:44:00+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  2:44PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't respond to exactly what the OP is asking, but I can point out something in my own experience that may be somehow relevant.<br/><br/>My tables are usually Full Myth. In fact my biggest enjoyment from most game systems is reading the setting flavor and detail. What's more, my games border upon what some consider railroading (though I don't personally take the definition to that much of an extreme). After much experimentation we've found that it works the best for us and except for occasional impromptu games, is what people come to the table expecting and wanting.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean there's not improvisation, player agency, or broad options. It just means that my players have come to expect a certain style and level of preparatory commitment on my part with regard to plot, setting, dramatis personae, props, background, and so on.<br/><br/>The reason for this is that my players tend to appreciate detail, subtlety, verisimilitude, and depth in games. Those are things that REQUIRE preparation. Even if you're very very smart and knowledgeable, creative as a profession and a talent, and have the best mechanical framework available you'll simply never achieve the breadth and depth of complexity from improvisation that you can with careful planning and sculpting. It's why you'll never see a big budget movie without some kind of working script and the ground work done on location scouting, casting, props, wardrobe, character development, etc. Whose Line is it Anyway is a hell of a fun show, but it could never compete in an award race with Lord of the Rings or Ben-Hur, nor achieve the lasting cultural impact of the Star Wars franchise (regardless of personal preferences).<br/><br/>How many times during an improvised session have you thought 'oh man, this is an awesome development...if only I'd thought of it back in scene X I could have laid this foundation for it and everyone would be completely amazed right now and we'd have this whole other thing to explore'?<br/><br/>Fully fleshed out NPC with traits and realism, deep sub-plots, inter-connectivity, detailed puzzles or riddles or functional details even on flavor items, foreshadowing, perfection of language or mood, etc. These are the hallmarks of great Full Myth that are, at best, random and accidental with No Myth.<br/><br/>Now, your mileage may well vary, but even though my tables have contained professional writers, actors, artists, lifelong gamers and developers, and exceptional super-geniuses, with most of the games ever written available to us, this has held true for us over 35 years.<br/><br/>The only real caveat to this is warrant. If you're not interested in those aspects of gaming to begin with, then obviously it wouldn't be beneficial to you no matter how true it is in general.<br/><br/>But that's why it's usually going to be Full Myth for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446460/#Comment_446460" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T15:00:13+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  3:00PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, surely the GM's feelings matter, too?

If a GM wants to prep a ton of stuff, either because they believe that writing it down somehow makes it "official" or whether they just find it hard to make stuff up on the fly, good for them.  But I don't think that really matters from a myth/no myth standpoint.<br/><br/>Also, I sortof disagree with phoenix182 that creating detailed and well fleshed out NPCs is even an example of "Full Myth" play.  I don't think it is.  Full Myth implies the creation of the entire world, or at least, the entire "place" that is being explored.  Having an idea of the personalities and motivations of your NPCs is something that is actually probably even MORE useful if you're going to be called on to make up a lot of stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446472/#Comment_446472" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T17:01:08+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  5:01PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Full Myth and No Myth are <em>both</em> unattainable ideals.

The mirror's magical effect on the other hand I see as more salient, that is to say I care more about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446475/#Comment_446475" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T17:03:52+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  5:03PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha.

It's interesting in both directions: "why is prepared better than random" and/or "why is random better than DM deciding."<br/><br/>Let's say the players find a bookshelf. The players grab one book.<br/><br/>\u2022 You have the whole shelf mapped out so you ask "OK which shelf, and counting from the left edge, which book?"<br/>\u2022 You have a list of ten random titles specific to this room<br/>\u2022 You have a list of ten random titles that is supposed to cover all bookshelfs in the entire world<br/>\u2022 You have one title in mind and tell that to the players.<br/><br/>I think I've sorted them from "unreasonable" to "too much control". The random method falls in the middle.<br/><br/>Why is the latter case, having one title in mind, "too much control"?<br/>It's because you can decide on a title that suits the moment -- and that's what chafes for me. It's too clever. It's too dramatic. It's too \u0427\u0435\u0301\u0445\u043e\u0432's Gun.<br/><br/>The mirror is another example. Maybe if we had immediately looked in the mirror, the DM would've decided that we could scry another world. But since we were scared of the mirror, the DM got influenced to think of it as a weapon, to have the toad monster vanish like a bubble. The DM riffing on our decision, playing along with us like jazz -- sounds cool, but makes our decisions meaningless. We found a magic mirror and we decided what to do with it <em>as it were</em>, without knowing what it was.<br/>And the module writer put it in there without knowing what we would do with it (but I guess he had some ideas). And our DM got to watch it all.<br/><br/>I got the feeling of really finding a magic mirror and to see what I (or rather, my level 1 monk, A'ina) would've done in that situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446510/#Comment_446510" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T19:25:57+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  7:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a sorta OCD for pleasing people. I feel both guilty about going full myth or no myth. When I go full myth I end up railroading (I've always been sublte and logic enough that my players have never complain about it anyway) because I often don't have enough time to prep a whole detailed world. When I go no myth, it's as phoenix182 says and my scenes lack substance, depth, etc.<br/><br/>But that's when I go No Myth <i>alone</i>.<br/><br/>I agree that it requires the GM to get used to it; it's part Play Unsafe, part brainstorming and part prep. It's a lot easier than going full myth but again, getting used to it is the hard part. What I do is create the whole setting with the players and hear their ideas about what they want to find in this world. Then in prep I flesh an connect those ideas into encounters, stats, characters, places and monsters. <br/><br/>This way players get to see what they want and their foreknowledge of it acts as their "character knowledge" about the matter. I often don't have to narrate what the PCs know about something after they roll their (proper knowledge skill) but instead the rest of the players get to hear the creator of that bit go "GASP!" and then quickly explain what they "know" about it. In play it works like if both the player and the GM did prep without being exhaustive about it.<br/><br/>It doesn't save them from surprises; I clearly state when they give me their input that what they are telling me is what their character knows and actual truth in the setting may differ. Also, I don't often let them know exactly when I'll be using their input. For best effect I use it when they are distracted with something or expecting something else.<br/><br/>I also tend to turn criticals and fumbles into story. Like, if one unimportant NPC or enemy unlikely evades several attacks, I narrate how they see something different about this one, and maybe try to make it escape the current battle so the party finds it later in a more important position and with some additional background or at least description. A bugbear that survived two encounters with the party and almost TPKed the players then now is the only clean, elegant and cultured bugbear in the setting (they saw him coming out of his bath and politely speaking with another npc before the third encounter)<br/><br/>I feel like at last I've found my own playing style, my own way to compromise between full Myth and No Myth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446513/#Comment_446513" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T19:45:32+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  7:45PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is why I mentioned the incident with Lady Blackbird and the dragon at the start of this thread:<br/><br/>It's really key, I feel, to understand (or at least explore) which aspects of this whole "Myth" thing scratch your creative itch. Some examples, each with a Devil's Advocate hypothetical (if I can think of one):<br/><br/>* Does the fun come from the feeling you have as a GM, or interfacing with something real and concrete, and presenting it to the players?<br/><br/>(In this case, would you enjoy it just as much if you had a phone line to another GM, who told you precisely what was in each room, and you just relayed it to the players? What if you knew that this other GM was making it all up as she went?)<br/><br/>* Does the fun come from knowing something about the *quality* of the material itself? Knowing that it's self-consistent, or balanced in regard to game challenge, or some other similar quality, like artistic genius beyond your own creative abilities?<br/><br/>(Would you ever insist that your GM run a game from a module, or base the game in a fictional world, because you want a higher quality of game material than what you feel the GM can produce? Would you accept such a statement from your players?)<br/><br/>* As a player, does the fun come from immersing in the world as though it was real, and *knowing* that it's not being made up on the spot, which gives your victories a certain legitimacy?<br/><br/>(In this case, how would you feel if you were playing in four different D&amp;D games, but before the games started, the GMs drew straws, and ONE of them had to improvise everything, while the other two played from notes? If you didn't know which one was real and which one was not, would it influence your enjoyment of the game? Or is it being likely enough?)<br/><br/>* As a player, does the fun come from a lack of trust for your GM?

So that's a very big plus for that. But it's not usually higher quality or more interesting or flavorful.\n<blockquote>In this case, would you enjoy it just as much if you had a phone line to another GM, who told you precisely what was in each room, and you just relayed it to the players? What if you knew that this other GM was making it all up as she went?</blockquote>\nOK, that is a pretty shocking and interesting thought experiment.<br/>Scenario 1:<br/>The co-GM on the other side of the line cannot see the players?<br/>The co-GM doesn't know what the players are doing?<br/>It's like:<br/>Local DM: "OK, co-GM... what are some of the books on the shelf in that room?"<br/>co-GM: "Hmm... one is the Joy of Spidersilk Gardening, the next one is Volo's Guide to the North".<br/><br/><br/>Later:<br/>Local DM: "OK, co-GM... what happens if someone looks in the mirror?"<br/>co-GM: "Let's say they disappear heh heh! What, did a player look?<br/>Local DM: "We can talk about that later. Now just focus on making things up. I am the referee, you are the channeler".<br/><br/>I.e. the set up is that the co-GM <em>doesn't know</em> what is happening and what the players are doing. And the co-GM writes everything down so it can fit into a logical and coherent world view.<br/><br/>Scenario 2:<br/><br/>Local DM: "OK, a player just lifted up the cloth and peeked in the mirror. What happens?"<br/>co-GM: "Oh, it's not dangerous, but they can scry an eldritch world!"<br/><br/>This scenario 2 is not ok. As for scenario 1... I might have to sleep on it. Very interesting.<br/><br/>To me, my reaction to this experiment suggests that separation between "prep" and "running" is a vital part of the appeal of Full Myth.\n<blockquote>As a player, does the fun come from immersing in the world as though it was real, and *knowing* that it's not being made up on the spot, which gives your victories a certain legitimacy?</blockquote>\nI believe so.\n<blockquote>In this case, how would you feel if you were playing in four different D&amp;D games, but before the games started, the GMs drew straws, and ONE of them had to improvise everything, while the other two played from notes? If you didn't know which one was real and which one was not, would it influence your enjoyment of the game? Or is it being likely enough?</blockquote>\nI would try to figure out through messing with the plot. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/>I couldn't help myself <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/>I'm sorry.\n<blockquote>Is there a way you can build this trust over time?</blockquote>\nI do not believe so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446521/#Comment_446521" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T20:15:22+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  8:15PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2015 8:21PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside, I can't let this go by without some comment (hopefully not a total derail):\n<blockquote><br/>The reason for this is that my players tend to appreciate detail, subtlety, verisimilitude, and depth in games. Those are things that REQUIRE preparation. Even if you're very very smart and knowledgeable, creative as a profession and a talent, and have the best mechanical framework available you'll simply never achieve the breadth and depth of complexity from improvisation that you can with careful planning and sculpting. It's why you'll never see a big budget movie without some kind of working script and the ground work done on location scouting, casting, props, wardrobe, character development, etc. Whose Line is it Anyway is a hell of a fun show, but it could never compete in an award race with Lord of the Rings or Ben-Hur, nor achieve the lasting cultural impact of the Star Wars franchise (regardless of personal preferences).<br/></blockquote>\nThe assumption that preparation leads to better results is not necessarily one which should go unexamined.<br/><br/>Why do I say that? I kind of have to. I'm a professional jazz musician, and a sometimes composer. So how do I decide whether I want to write a piece of music note-for-note, or give space to the musicians to improvise? Here, in this spot? How about here?<br/><br/>There are lots of great composers who have learned that, with the right musicians, your piece will sound better if you allow creative space instead of writing exactly what should happen.<br/><br/>It's certainly not as simple as:<br/><br/>* Preparation means high-quality content.<br/>* Improvisation saves you time and effort, but at the cost of lower-quality content.<br/><br/>Not at all. If that were the case, jazz as a genre would not exist.<br/><br/>And why do a lot of bands sound better live than on their recordings, even though recordings typically (especially in the modern era) "fix" all the mistakes, and are arguably just better products, more carefully considered?<br/><br/>Consider for a minute that you wanted to have an important conversation with someone. Perhaps it's a date. Or a job interview. Or you're coming out of the closet and you need to tell your family.<br/><br/>Do you prepare beforehand, writing out *exactly* what you're going to say? Or would you rather speak as it is seems right in the moment?<br/><br/>(Also, are those the only two options? Or are there lots of hubrid forms, like a checklist of things you need to say, which you can go through in any order you like?)<br/><br/>I think I speak for most of us when I say that we wouldn't want to bring a script on a first date with someone we like. Why is that? Surely, if you prepared beforehand, you could make a better impression?<br/><br/>Well, turns out that improvising carries a lot of advantages which are lost when material is prepared beforehand. Adapting and adjusting to the other party. Being able to take advantage of inspiration. Being able to build on something the other party brings to the table. A general sense of honesty and connection. Responsiveness. Intimacy. (That's why you don't bring a script on your date, after all.)<br/><br/>We also just plain *listen* better when we're not sticking to a script. When you're following a pre-set formula, your brain is multi-tasking and you don't pay as much attention to the people you are working with - it blinds you to a certain extent.<br/><br/>All of these things are lost when you stick to prepared material - it's a trade-off, not just a question of convenience and saving time.<br/><br/>I was really shocked when I read "Well of Souls", one of the first public "Narrativist" adventure scenarios. Why was I shocked? First of all, it didn't plan out any future events; just NPC motivations, background details, and so forth. Second, and worse, it had a big revelation built into the plot (I don't remember if it was a murder or a wedding, but there was something which happened, and it could have been one of two different people). And it <i>didn't specify</i> which one it was!<br/><br/>What?!? What's the point of leaving that out of the scenario?<br/><br/>I later realized that this was very, very intentional. The idea was to see how the game developed, what themes were present, and then be able to choose, in the moment, the revelation which would be the most hard-hitting, or the one most likely to create the best play going forward. If your goal is surprise, you can achieve it almost every time. If your goal is to complicate the situation, you can do so.<br/><br/>Imagine playing Star Wars. You've decided that Darth Vader is secretly Anakin's son. Ooh, this is going to be a cool revelation! And you can foreshadow the crap out of it.<br/><br/>But what happens if Anakin's player is just not interested in Darth Vader? He's obsessed with his relationship to Obi-Wan, instead, and that starts taking over the game.<br/><br/>What if you started the game with the knowledge that Anakin is a foster kid, and we don't know much about who his dad was beyond some rumours. The player is obviously into exploring this (maybe even came up with it himself). We start to build some foreshadowing around that: here are some hints about how Darth Vader could be his dad... but here are also some hints that Obi-Wan treats him a little too much like he was family, and now we find an old book in the attic of the farm which appears to be written by a relative of Anakin, but it's spelled with the family name <i>Palpatine</i>. <br/><br/>In play, we can pick the moment to reveal that the Emperor, or Obi-Wan, or Vader... is the father! Or maybe that it was all misguided and his "uncle" is actually his real father, after all. Or that he was cloned, and doesn't have a family, but his genes were constructed out of bio-samples from all the greatest Jedi in the galaxy by his creepy uncle.<br/><br/>That's a very different kind of potential. It could fall flat, but it also could allow us to reach greater heights of drama in a different way. And the player can be involved in it, too, without necessarily spoiling the surprise.<br/><br/>So, what's the point? <br/><br/>* Improvisation is not necessarily lower-quality than preparation. We have entire artistic fields (like jazz, some forms of rap, some forms of acting, etc) which demonstrate that spontaneous creation can be TRAINED. You can learn to improvise at just as high a level as people write/prepare/etc.<br/><br/>I'm playing a show tonight with a trumpet player who is a competent but not brilliant improviser. When we recorded an album this winter, he wrote complex and beautiful solos to play and learned them. They are arguably much better than what he normally plays. But, playing "from the page", his playing lots its spark. His time feel wasn't as good, there was less emotional impact in his playing, and he didn't execute the lines with his usual intensity. I could instantly hear that he wasn't improvising, and it just didn't have the usual impact.<br/><br/>And, significantly, whole groups can learn to do this. Music is no simpler than gaming (or, at least, it's on a similar plane, if you disagree with that), but I've seen musicians and groups of musicians learn to improvise with tremendous complexity: there is all the same sense of structure and depth, but with the added spark of spontaneous creation.<br/><br/>I've also seen groups of gamers improvise fiction on a level far better than most modules or scenarios or plots I've seen. "No Myth" allows you to explore that spectrum<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446522/#Comment_446522" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T20:18:28+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  8:18PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the jazz!<br/>Hence let me zoom out.

I don't get the kicks.</blockquote>\nI'm getting the sense that, at least for you, this is the fulcrum of the Full Myth/No Myth issue: something about having the answer be a quantum state that only collapses when observed rubs you the wrong way.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446527/#Comment_446527" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T20:49:38+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  8:49PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't agree that "No Myth" is unattainable at all - that's kindof the point.  All you need for "No myth" play is the admission that, hey, this stuff isn't real, I haven't made it all up ahead of time, so it's going to be stuff I make up as I go along.  That doesn't mean the GM is going to be inventing random stuff or just spouting gibberish, that everything is going to be completely disconnected.  It just means the GM hasn't plotted out the layout of the Tower of Evil, or established the distance from Lake Town to Woodsville.  "Full Myth" is, in fact, a myth because you can't make up everything but - and this is the important but - you are PRETENDING that you can/have.  There is no such pretending in No Myth.   There's just no reason for it to be there.<br/><br/>I think, humorously, that randomness is also basically No Myth - as soon as you admit that you're rolling to find out what's there, you might as well just be making it up.  There's no longer anything "real" by any stretch, and the dice are just as arbitrary as a person.  I guess there's some weird conception that the dice are more "fair" than a person, but they're also more DUMB.   And anyway, who is populating the "table" the dice are picking from? The GM.  So if he really wants something to happen, that table can easily look like "Okay, 1-19, it's ogres, on a 20, it's goblins." or whatever.<br/><br/>No, you don't "put the trap wherever the PCs go";  Because by the time the PCs decide to go there, you should have already decided where the trap is.  I think there's this huge misconception about "No Myth" that gets trotted out every time someone wants to criticize it.  People act like everything is invented right there as it happens. And this is completely false.   Say the PCs come to a four way intersection, so they have three choices (having already approached from one side).  They can go North, West, or South.  The GM doesn't wait for the players to decide "Okay, we go South" and then scramble to  think of what's down the South corridor.  The GM instead thinks "Okay, they're at an intersection. South is a dead end with a pit trap, North leads to the dungeon, where there are probably some guards and West is towards the Warlock's Sanctum, so there's going to be some magical wards."  So there's no "Oh, you picked South? Okay, there's a pit trap!" - the pit trap was already there before the PCs went that way, but it was there 20 seconds before, and not 20 hours before.  The fact that GM wrote it down the night more doesn't make it any more or less true than the version the GM decided 20 seconds before.  Similarly, with your example with the mirror - in a "No Myth" situation, the GM isn't going to wait for a player to look into the mirror before he decides what it does.  He's going to decide that beforehand, so that he knows how to deal with it if the PCs do, or don't, or throw a goblin in front of it, or whatever.<br/><br/>I think that misconception that everything is being made up "on the spot" means that everything is being made up the very moment it is needed is fundamental to your problems with "No Myth".  And while I guess I can't promise you that no one runs a game like that, it seems absurd that someone would try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446529/#Comment_446529" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T21:09:03+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  9:09PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isaac: you're right, but I want to phrase it as a positive.

It's not about prepared <em>plot</em>. It's about prepared <em>place</em>. Items, people. I didn't do this when writing my book (I wrote it No Myth then, like the King says, waited two weeks then went back and deleted 10%). But I enjoy it when playing RPGs.<br/><br/>2. RPGs aren't always about story. I love the website story-games.com/forums but I am not necessarily into "story" in gaming. I think Adam and Sage made a good choice when they deliberately avoided that word in making Dungeon World.</blockquote>\nHeh! I was sure you were going to say that.<br/><br/>First of all, some of the stuff I'm talking about DOES suit  narrativist/intense-stories kind of stuff particularly well. <br/><br/>If I were playing a competitive game where I try to outsmart my opponent I certainly wouldn't see the point if they could move around their pieces after-the-fact.<br/><br/>All very true, and very real tendencies.<br/><br/>However, it doesn't negate my point. Here's a D&amp;D example:<br/><br/>* We're playing a bunch of badass adventurers, and exploring a "sandbox"-style world. The concept is heavy on the undead paradigm: zombies, liches, all that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>* One day, one of our characters levels up and gets a really powerful ability or magical item, which allows us to control undead.<br/><br/>* Suddenly, all the undead threats are not challenging anymore.<br/><br/>What do we do now?<br/><br/>There's a total possibility in a "No Myth", fully-scripted world that something like this happens:<br/><br/>1) Since the concept of the campaign was otherworldly demonic forces from the underworld breaking into 'reality', there are undead everywhere. We've short-circuited the entire campaign; nothing is a challenge anymore.<br/><br/>2) We've got this awesome ability or artifact, but it turns out there are no undead anywhere on the continent where we live. (Except we don't know that, or only the GM knows.)<br/><br/>Neither is terribly satisfying, most likely. (For the sake of this horribly exaggerated example; clearly it's hyperbole. Please don't poke holes in the example - I'm just trying to illustrate how non "story-oriented" concerns can come out of flexibility/prep.)<br/><br/>Embracing aspects of "No Myth" play allows you, as a group, to say, "OK, so what WOULD be an interesting challenge for this group?" Maybe it's traveling elsewhere, maybe it's finding sources of challenge where there are no undead. Clearly the undead thing is basically solved; so what's next? <br/><br/>Or maybe the entire focus of the campaign shifts. This otherworldly demonic threat can now be handled; the PCs become some of the most important people in the campaign, and are asked to rule. Now we need to come up with relationship maps or new otherworldly forces, or perhaps some details on how the government in this world is run... something else.<br/><br/>'No Myth' allows to go there, effortlessly. The hypothetical 'Full Myth' (which, of course, doesn't exist in reality) COULD potentially leave us stranded with a whole book of information that's no longer relevant to our campaign, or no longer a challenge to our characters, or simply no longer in line with our interests. <br/><br/>Now we have to improvise.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446533/#Comment_446533" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T21:18:06+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  9:18PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Airk.

The session is an improvisation, all right, but all players are aware of it and come with some idea for inspiration; instruments are prepared and according to what you brought, everyone will adapt and play something different. But well, basically my point is that learning to improvise is just prepping in a different way.<br/><br/>I'm speaking from experience. When I got burnt out as a GM a few years ago, I was exhausted of doing prep and started researching many different ways of improvising things for games. From generators and random tables of any kind to returning the questions to the players and othe tricks. It took a while but I finally realized that even after some training, my best games had been by far the ones where I did some responsible prep, like learning the best tricks to improvise stuff, make my own random tables or <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/latest-version-of-the-resourcefull-deck/" rel="nofollow">devices</a> and taking in consideration the players interests and draw inspiration from there. <br/><br/>But well I consider prep even getting to know most of the rules by memory instead of just learning how to play and GM the game, because the former speeds up gameplay greatly and being self-confident in front of the players about this particular makes everybody feel a bit more relaxed at the table about just playing and letting the GM take care of the mechanical stuff.<br/><br/>Definitions of Prep aside; as a GM this is why I feel ok with Illusionism. Either if it was in the prep twenty years ago or if it was made up just now, what matters more to me is the effect it produces on the players. Their Suspension of Disbelief allows us to have fun, so as a GM I prefer to respect that and don't just tell them if it was made up while I was at the toilet. Unless they ask (which is often because part of it felt improvised, which would be my fault.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446540/#Comment_446540" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T21:42:13+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  9:42PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please let's not go into the Ill-word on this thread                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446544/#Comment_446544" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T21:52:06+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  9:52PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's easier to referee fairly if you give up some amount of control to your co-DM, the dice!</blockquote>\nWhy is rolling dice and consulting a table fairer than making stuff up?<br/><br/>For example: Random tables generate results that often make no sense in context.

For people that like the things I talked about my tables enjoying they're going to be achieved more often with careful, detailed prep than with improvisation (for the reasons I touched on before).<br/><br/>To apply this to your music example, not everyone likes jazz (or even live tracks). There's a reason the overwhelming percentage of musical pieces on radio (or modern equivalents) are studio tracks. Music appreciation is subjective, much like rpgs. Any particular deviation may be more pleasing to some, but is just as likely to be less pleasing to an equivalent set.<br/><br/>As for your 'script or no-script' example, I would script it. Absolutely, every time. I may deviate from the script once begun, but I would NEVER attempt to say anything important unless I'd scripted it fully first. It's going to achieve better results more often (providing the point was to say specific things in specific ways) when scripted, which is why you're taught to do this in communication/speech classes. On a first date? You're not trying to say a specific thing in a specific way. You don't yet know your audience, or even necessarily the topics. It's an interview, not a dramatic piece. A movie or book is generally different. Now some people may prefer their RPGs to be interviews, but if they prefer them to be movies they'll like it better more often with a script. <br/><br/>Again, I'm sure there may be exceptions, but in 35+ years with groups including professional authors, actors, creators, intellectuals, etc, I have NEVER seen an improvisation as broad and deep as a prepared piece. Not one time. I've seen very good improv, and very fun improv. I've seen a deep moment, or one broad aspect. But never the kind of consistent vast detail and intricacy that is achieved through careful preparation. Again, I'm not talking objectively better, but subjectively better at achieving specific goals. <br/><br/>I have a feeling it's largely a general personal tendency too...for instance, while I can enjoy jazz I far prefer rote classical. While I can enjoy improv I far prefer a scripted movie. While I can enjoy spontaneous poetry I far prefer a known sonnet. The things that I enjoy are exact things that require preparation...practiced precision.

For GMs who do enjoy it, though, there are certain specific benefits for players.  Just because improv GMing is also awesome doesn't mean it covers the same bases as Full Myth play.<br/><br/>Here's an example: I've been in the position of trying to fake Full Myth play for players who were used to it with other GMs.  I liked Full Myth but I didn't enjoy every bit of the work my predecessors had done, so I did my best to cheat.  In the process, I discovered what did and didn't work for my group of Full Myth-loving players.  <br/><br/>First, one note:<br/>When I've described this in the past, some people have said, "Those players are needlessly picky and just want what they're used to for no other reason than familiarity."  I disagree.  Picky?  Yes.  Needlessly?  No.  Their requirements do impact the roleplay experience in tangible ways.<br/><br/>So, here's what worked for me, as GM:<br/>- Looking up fictional facts is fine.<br/>- Rolling to evaluate in-fiction probabilities (does it rain today?) is fine as long as they're well-modeled (don't forget, we're in a low-rain terrain). <br/>- Stating with complete certainty what happens without any look-ups or rolls is fine.<br/>- Any one of these eventually ceases to be fine if it shows any pattern of producing implausible nonsense, but "simple statement" is on the shortest leash.<br/>- Pretending to look up fictional facts or pretending to roll for probabilities while actually making stuff up and then stating it with complete certainty is fine if I don't get caught making stuff up.  Giveaways are things like far-away glances which betray creative thought.<br/>- Asking players for established fictional info is fine, as long as I can seamlessly fall back to an appropriate Plan B if they don't remember the info.  If they don't remember whether the info was ever established, I can look-up or roll.  If they remember the info was established but not what it was, I must look-up.<br/>- Anything else is <i>not</i> fine.  (By which I mainly mean transparent invention.)<br/><br/><b>Why (this type of) Full Myth is so awesome:</b><br/>The advantage to playing this way is hard to explain, but concerns the weight of the fictional world and the realness of the events within, both during play and after play.  It's perhaps less important to in-the-moment fiction-based satisfaction than it is to a sense of real-world permanence and achievement over time.  In imprecise shorthand: "There's a big difference between changing (through roleplaying in it) a world that comes and goes and changing a world that's solid and persistent."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446557/#Comment_446557" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T22:50:38+00:00" title="July 14, 2015 10:50PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(My point being that codifying everything in advance is always going to be a trade-off at some level, and that elements of "No Myth" give a game flexibility, responsiveness, and the ability to adapt.) <br/><br/>(I don't think that it's a failure of the game if a sandbox D&amp;D GM shifts around some of the locations of module adventure in the game world in order to create a game which better suits the interests of the group, for example, especially if those things hadn't been established already, and the GM isn't doing it in order to fulfill some other agenda. I saw you doing lots of this kind of stuff in our IRC D&amp;D game - for example, offering adventure hooks in response to player interests and such.)</blockquote>\nAh, yes - that's why I'm so agnostic on this matter, in part. While I appreciate a lot what is possible near the ends of this continuum, in reality Full Myth runs into some drastic difficulties if one tries to take it as some sort of an absolute guideline. It's not a value in itself, one might say.<br/><br/>Considering my D&amp;D style, for instance, you know how I sermonize about the "logistics phase" and "negotiation of challenge"? That's basically the No Myth part of the game, at a strategic level, where we acknowledge openly that this is not a simulation, people, we're not just running a medieval sandbox simulation for the fun of it; we're adventure gaming, and this means that it is OK for the GM to provide demographically unlikely hooks (you don't need to roll to have a wounded messenger for the crown prince stumble into the tavern just as the PCs happen to be there), players to have their characters to stupid shit to stumble into adventure (players who voluntarily have their characters get drunk and wake up in chains on a slave ship do not need to fear an unsportsmanlike quick death after that - they'll get at least a sporting chance), and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Later on, as we drill down and recognize the challenge, the Myth sets, so to speak - freedoms that were necessary and desirable while still negotiating the challenge would be unacceptable arbitrary decision-making when the stakes are high and heat is on.<br/><br/>There is no contradiction to having the same game feature high and low arbitrariness at different times, because No Myth vs. Full Myth is only a continuum in the abstract; in reality we have various stages of the game that are set up in different ways, and prepped for with different techniques, and we can thus only talk about the Myth level in the aggregate. As Sandra describes, <i>of course</i> she doesn't mean by "Full Myth" that she tries to simulate everything - nobody could do that and run an interesting game at the same time. It's just a matter of relative emphasis, whether you've got more Myth than some other game might.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446558/#Comment_446558" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T22:51:16+00:00" title="July 14, 2015 10:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: script vs improv, my position is that, absent some really coercive GMing, there will always be tons of improv; no amount of scripting will destroy that.

Does the map have to be completely detailed, or is a rough sketch enough? Does leaving blanks hurt?<br/><br/>Or is this a sliding scale thing, where ideally the DM would have Castle Greyhawk all planned out (but not any kind of plot, just what and where things were to start with) and everyone would explore it, while understanding that that level of detail is tough to get in practice?<br/><br/>I'm trying to get a sense for where you personally draw the line, so I can figure out what kind of techniques might help while staying on the Full-Myth/Full-Prep side of your personal line. <br/><br/>I personally lean more towards the some-prep but not full-prep side of things. That is one reason why I seized on things like Fronts, and Diaspora's social conflicts, and Mouse Guard's mission structure is that it lets me plan out an overall structure while letting me improvise moment-to-moment stuff. I try to improvise everything as a sole GM and it gets too loose. (Fiasco or Microscope are different, particularly because you can revisit things fractally in Microscope.)<br/><br/>The flip side of this is that I also use a lot of reincorporation; and I don't change stuff once it's established, even when I'm the only one who knows what it was.

I always love hearing how methodically you've observed the details of this kind of stuff with your gaming group; that kind of insight is very rare. I'd love to hear more about it, in fact, but I don't have a specific question right now ("it" = your list of what kind of GM input/technique is acceptable, and which crosses the line).<br/><br/>phoenix182,<br/><br/>You make lots of good points about the subjectivity of the whole thing, and how much it can rely on personal preference. \n<blockquote><br/>What I was trying to say is that within a given subjective preference of outcomes one method will achieve greater degrees of success more consistently...at least in my experience. For people that like the things I talked about my tables enjoying they're going to be achieved more often with careful, detailed prep than with improvisation (for the reasons I touched on before).<br/></blockquote>\nI still take issue with this, however. First of all, improvisation CAN be trained to a very high level; that just rarely happens in the modern Western world. (There used to be trained improvisational storytellers as well as similar musical traditions in various cultures, but we rarely see that these days, with the exception of jazz, dance-offs, and freestyle rap.)<br/><br/>I've <i>definitely</i> seen gaming groups create incredible stuff without it being pre-plotted. (c.f. All Narrativist gaming, ever. Some LARP traditions. GMless play. Online roleplaying like forum play. And so on.) Absolutely, to the extent that it surpasses a lot or most typical "plotted" play.<br/><br/>(I recognize that this is very difficult to believe if you haven't experienced it first-hand. As one example, however, I can point to musical theorists, who have started analyzing high-level improvised music - by true masters, mind you - and finding all the same organizational elements, like thematic development, pitch class set use, motivic pairing, successful Schenkerian analysis, and so forth, that they find in great classical symphonies or similar works.)<br/><br/>Just like debate about other aspects of subjective taste (love, music, food, whatever), the best way to appreciate this is to consider why you might reject a more extreme position than your own.<br/><br/>Consider this as an example: if deciding things in advance makes the experience so much better, why not have the players play from a script, too? <br/><br/>Well, you probably value the activity of spontaneous dialogue, right? I doubt very much that the dialogue at your table will be delivered as "well" by your players (unless they are professional actors, perhaps) when they are reading from a script. Dialogue will likely feel stilted and unnatural, instead. <br/><br/>It's an example of how with each added layer of preparation, some other valued feature disappears or is diminished.<br/><br/>So, if we decide dialogue must remain "fresh", what else? Surely you could prepare even better as a GM if you could first have the players tell you exactly how they plan to react to certain events or circumstances? Let's say a player tells you that their character hates Klingorians so much that they would erupt into violence when they see one. Now you can introduce a Klingorian at the exact moment where you want violence to break out.<br/><br/>That would allow you to create an even more finely-crafted experience. <br/><br/>But surely it's not hard to see how some other, highly valuable features of play would go by the wayside. In this case, it's the player's ability to engage in spontaneous creative (or strategic) choices.<br/><br/>In the same way, limiting the GM's responses reduces some of their creative input into the game (even if it's from the GM's own notes and planning).<br/><br/>I'm not arguing for any particular point along that spectrum: I think it's very worthwhile to explore the full range of planned to spontaneous.<br/><br/>I just want to put in my two cents on a topic which I find fascinating, and take a rhetorical stand against the idea that a certain technique is unconditionally superior.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446577/#Comment_446577" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T02:49:29+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  2:49AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Your last post is <i>excellent</i>.\n<blockquote><br/>[...] in reality Full Myth runs into some drastic difficulties if one tries to take it as some sort of an absolute guideline. It's not a value in itself, one might say.<br/></blockquote>\nPrecisely. It's about the "how" and the "when", not just the "how much".\n<blockquote><br/>There is no contradiction to having the same game feature high and low arbitrariness at different times, because No Myth vs. Full Myth is only a continuum in the abstract; in reality we have various stages of the game that are set up in different ways, and prepped for with different techniques, and we can thus only talk about the Myth level in the aggregate. As Sandra describes, <i>of course</i> she doesn't mean by "Full Myth" that she tries to simulate everything - nobody could do that and run an interesting game at the same time. It's just a matter of relative emphasis, whether you've got more Myth than some other game might.</blockquote>\nSince we've all been discussing Forge theory for a bit, I'd like to mention that THIS is where I personally find the concept of Creative Agenda immensely helpful. (Hopefully this is interesting to you, Sandra.)<br/><br/>It allows me - as a player, as a designer, in any role - to cut through a lot of typical roleplaying debates and do what is going to make the game the most fun it can be.<br/><br/>Typical RPG debates might go on about how locations have to be prepped, whether things should always be rolled for or not, and so forth. In other words, we're talking about Technical Agenda, personal preferences for techniques and mechanics, and so forth.<br/><br/>However, a game group that has a strong sense of the creative goals of their game doesn't NEED any of that. (Not that they must be *intellectually* aware of Forge-mandated Creative Agenda or anything like that - of course it can be done "naively". This is not an argument for theory on my part.)<br/><br/>Eero's "challenge-based adventuring" model can effortlessly jump from prepped modules to random tables to whim-based creativity, from "letting the dice fall where they may" to a sort of metagame protection (of course we should let the drunken sailor's player a fair chance to escape his captors) and even dramatic coordination (we don't need to establish via dice rolls whether an adventure hook exists in the particular area where the characters are hanging out - it doesn't harm us in any way to agree as a group that they do or do not).<br/><br/>This, to me, is the real payoff of the awareness of creative agenda. When we are focused on the creative goals of the game, we can use the tools we need in the places where we need them, instead of getting bogged down in endless debate about the tools themselves.<br/><br/>In this particular example, we certainly couldn't reverse the tools: have the GM decide on a whim when characters live or die, but roll dice to establish which strategies the characters are allowed to use in this particular session, and so on.<br/><br/>An understanding of the creative agenda of a particular game allows us to stop bickering about technical matters out of context, and, instead, find ever better ways to apply those technical tools to the game at hand. <br/><br/>That's where, for me, this stuff delivers real-world, dramatic, practical functionality.<br/><br/>In this case, is Full Myth better? It really depends. What's this game about?<br/><br/>Maybe, depending on your priorities, you'll find that having detailed character backgrounds is really important, but establishing local customs can be done on-the-fly, because one is key to what we're trying to explore in this game... and the other is just dressing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446578/#Comment_446578" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T03:08:09+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  3:08AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 4:45AM by AsIf.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Fair" here just means "the way that makes me happy," whatever that is.

A classic example would be a subsystem that determines local weather based on season and regional climate.<br/><br/>You might say the table itself (its internal logic, along with any rules or variables attached) can be a diegetic prop rather than a non-diegetic tool.  This is qualitatively different than (say) rolling Rory's Story cubes and stringing the results together.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446584/#Comment_446584" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T05:24:47+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  5:24AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots and lots of answers when I was asleep!\n<blockquote><blockquote>It's easier to <em>referee</em> [new emphasis] fairly if you give up some amount of control to your co-DM, the dice!</blockquote>\nWhy is rolling dice and consulting a table fairer than making stuff up?</blockquote>\nWhen I'm running the orcs (making their decisions) and deciding their strength and number at the same time, what am I? Am I adversary, am I referee, am I a careful bird that has to beat up the players very very gently?<br/>When the amount of orcs and their strength has been pre-set on the map, and the players run into them, and I have to run the orcs and fight for them, what am I? A referee that should focus on portraying the world vividly (which includes having the orcs fight fiercely).<br/>The more time that passes between me placing those orcs vs me running those orcs, the easier the compartmentalization process is.

They are excellent at giving completely different types of kicks and I'm often aiming for a synthesis -- i.e. my struggle of forgoing initiative rolls in D&amp;D.<br/>The fronts and blank-space-riddled maps are very interesting for what they are but they don't satisfy me in this particular regard.\n<blockquote>Or is this a sliding scale thing, where ideally the DM would have Castle Greyhawk all planned out (but not any kind of plot, just what and where things were to start with) and everyone would explore it, while understanding that that level of detail is tough to get in practice?</blockquote>\nYeah, exactly!\n<blockquote>I personally lean more towards the some-prep but not full-prep side of things.

That's true in all games, myth or no myth! :-)<br/><br/>In a Full Myth campaign, for me, the tables and dice serve as an intermediary between pure improv and prepped or semi-prepped elements.  I don't necessarily see a contradiction there either, although if I'm to consider it "Full Myth" it requires a certain level of logic and breadth in the construction of those tables.  Knowing the logic of the table that represents monsters in this region, or weather on this island, allows me to <i>know my world</i> - even though I don't roll the dice for this particular day until we get to that particular spot.<br/><br/>In No-Myth games I'll do binary trees (50-50 yes/no chains) at the drop of a hat, starting from "the most obvious thing that occurs to me at this moment" - even for major details.  But that doesn't feel like <i>knowing my world;</i> it feels like <i>discovering random stuff.</i>  In a Full Myth campaign I only use that technique for tertiary details.  <br/><br/>I like both types of games, because different games are aiming for different things.  There's a different kind of internal reward that I feel when comparing these approaches subjectively.  I'd even hazard a guess that they release different neurotransmitters.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446602/#Comment_446602" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T07:40:43+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  7:40AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In that case, I actually don't think it's a spectrum, but a binary.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter how far ahead of time it was prepared. What matters is simply: was this "thing" invented and/or defined in response to a specific action on the part of the characters ("we tip the mirror over!"), or not (i.e. before the characters interacted with it)?<br/><br/>(Certainly, gray areas are possible - "OK, the characters are in the room with it, they'll probably look into it, right?" or "Even before the campaign started, I knew a mirror would be cool, because Jeff likes to make characters who are narcissists and like to check themselves out in mirrors." - but, in theory, there is a line somewhere.)<br/><br/>Next question:<br/><br/>Do you realize that, no matter what you come up with, no matter how well-defined, there will still be moments where you have to improvise? You might know how the mirror works, but then a player says, "Ok, I pour blood on it, so everything reflected in it turns red. What happens NOW?" And of course you never thought of that, so you've got to come up with something.<br/><br/>That's why prep is good, but principled GMing and mental hygiene/discipline are arguably more important (or, at least, they're STILL important).

That's also part of the adoration of the dice. They surprise you.</blockquote>\nIrrelevant. Even if the GM makes everything up, he is still playing to find out as long as the players also have meaningful input into the game.  This goes back to what Ben Robbins had to say on the difference between randomness (Dice rolling) and uncertainty (Not knowing what's going to happen because there are other people at the table and you can't predict them).  While randomness is one way to generate uncertainty, you don't need randomness to have uncertainty, and uncertainty is where the interesting stuff comes from.<br/><br/>I also think reframing the discussion as "prep" just makes my point more clear - it doesn't matter if the prep was done 30 seconds ago or 30 years ago.  All that matters is that it was done before the prep is interacted with.  The fact that you attempted (and apparently, from what I can tell, felt you got bad results from) to play a game where everything was made up in the exact second it was touched doesn't mean that's the only way to do No Myth.   In fact, that strikes me as a way to catastrophically fail at running a No Myth game, and I find it baffling that you insist on holding it up as your "This didn't work for me, so I've gone to completely the other end of the spectrum" example.  This has enormous downsides with no upside that I can discern:<br/><br/>-- It creates extra work for yourself because instead of being able to think "Okay, there's a bomb on the table, what does a bomb look like?" you have to think "Okay, there's a thing on the table, and it looks like... a box? And it's uhm, 12cm by 20cm. And there are some wires? Maybe?  And it might be a bomb...but I can't decide that yet..."<br/>-- It suffers from all the second guessing "well, now that they've picked this hallway, am I a jerk for putting a trap in it?  But if I don't put a trap in it, they'll never run into any traps..." stuff that you raise as concern in this thread.<br/>-- It makes it enormously difficult to keep things coherent.<br/>-- You have to deliberately work to not make up stuff in advance, which is, as best as I can tell, contrary to human nature.  It's super weird to say "There's a hallway" and then not think, in even the vaguest of terms, about where it might go.<br/><br/>But virtually all of this trouble gets swept out of the way if you allow the GM to think ahead.  Which is still No Myth play.\n<blockquote>However, the angle I had was neither of those. It was "Why is Full Myth so awesome and how can I get there consistently and easily"? </blockquote>\nThat's kindof the whole point.  You CAN'T get there "easily".  This is the reason people are essentially telling you "Hey, you can get 95% of the same effect for 25% of the work, so you might want to think about how to do that well."  As best as I can tell from my limited perspective, "No myth" began because "full myth" was way too bloody much work for the reward.  Full myth is the stuff of "I have this massive 3 ring binder full of Campaign notes, but the stuff my PCs have encountered fits on three pages. Oh, and we've been playing for two years."  It's the same school as "I wrote up twelve pages of backstory for my character, and none of it ever comes out in play."  It requires enormous amounts of work because you have to try to prepare EVERYTHING, or you're breaking your own myth and it all becomes a lie.  Except it's always going to be a lie.  There's always going to be some amount of stuff that you just had to make up.  So there is no "full myth" or "complete prep" or anything.  <br/><br/>So I guess I too am interested in the answer for "Why 2097 thinks Full Myth is so awesome" in light of the fact that you really haven't posted anything here that is dependent on Full Myth at all.  It just seems more like you had problems with your attempts at No Myth, and now you are swinging the pendulum back the other way as firmly as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446627/#Comment_446627" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T14:49:06+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  2:49PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The fact that you attempted (and apparently, from what I can tell, felt you got bad results from) to play a game where everything was made up in the exact second it was touched doesn't mean that's the only way to do No Myth.

A perfectly consistent and objective GM <i>would</i> be just as fair as dice, but that person does not exist.  And even if they do, no players would believe in them.<br/><br/>Now, if the group doesn't define fairness that way, or only cares about fairness up to a certain point, then there's no issue with the GM just deciding.

First of all, improvisation CAN be trained to a very high level; that just rarely happens in the modern Western world.

After all, can you point to a Billboard top 100 that features freestyle rap? Some songs might have started as freestyle, but then they were likely heavily modified and polished to be an official release. Not that Billboard is the sole measure of what's good, but you get the point.<br/><br/>Players do script. Not only do my players create their characters, but they're welcome to join in world creation (though we do it during preparation far more than at play). They also provide plot and storylines (which I will then usually embellish or tool to fit well in the big picture).<br/><br/>I also know (in general) how they'll react. I know their character alignments (or equivalent), their charcter backgrounds, the game setting information, and I know their tendencies as players. While no DM will ever prepare for everything they'll do, the better you prep the less frequently they'll surprise you, and the deeper and more intricate the games will become.<br/><br/>Yes the content of dialogue generally remains fluid, but often the topic, bullet points, and mannerisms of dialogue are scripted, just as with published adventures. That's what allows the depth and breadth, which would otherwise be nearly impossible to do well on the fly.<br/><br/>Prep in no way limits creativity or improvisational response (after all, prep IS creativity and improvisation...just done before the game begins). It merely brings the imaginary world closer to reality (or in this case, good fiction) thereby improving immersion and verisimilitude, allowing for the dynamic aspects to flow freer and richer. It's the difference between Temple of Apshai, Ultima II, or Wizardry and Witcher III or Skyrim. It just makes the same gaming experience richer and prettier - IF you value the specific aspects that are changed over the ones that aren't at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446641/#Comment_446641" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T16:14:17+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  4:14PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, I agree.

Ok, forget the ill-word part, I had two points there that have been argumented a lot ever since:<br/><br/>-Learning to improvise is another way of doing prep.<br/><br/>-From actual experience, I back phoenix182 in that doing as much prep as you can allows you to give the players good game experience on almost each session, versus the fact that going no-myth may give you an even better experience, but not as often as going full-myth will do... if your players are into that, of course.<br/><br/>Why do we still endorse the use of (at least a bit of) prepared material over going no-myth impro? At some point, both are produced in exactly the same way. Either the GM or the players come up with an idea and both help to connect that idea with the shared fiction. But then, the prepared material is polished: a short NPC monologue can be revised for a better effect; a random monster can become a metaphor, a mysterious murder can be better linked with clues and witnesses; proper red herrings can be added. A place or a creature could be drawn instead of just described and a piece of music to give the proper ambience to a particular scene can be searched with more care and less waste of game time.<br/><br/>And the GM may notice in time that the original idea may ruin some aspect of the fictional space, stop in her tracks and rethink the whole thing.<br/><br/><br/>But it's not for nothing that I wrote above that going no-myth may give you an even better experience. There are times when the game attains flow by itself, everybody's inspiration is on fire and magical moments come by itself better than if they were pre-written by geniuses. Certainly the GM and players can train themselves to achieve this more consistently, yet the miracle of perfect improvisation is certain to happen less often.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it/p6">6</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20263/why-is-full-myth-so-awesome-i-dont-get-it/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20263%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20263%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Why is Full Myth so awesome?

The exact same impulses which allow us to work together as humans at the game table (picking up on social cues, getting caught up in the fun of the moment, etc.) also serve to bias us against consistency and objectivity.  A perfectly consistent and objective GM <i>would</i> be just as fair as dice, but that person does not exist.  And even if they do, no players would believe in them.<br/><br/>Now, if the group doesn't define fairness that way, or only cares about fairness up to a certain point, then there's no issue with the GM just deciding.  So I think the points you've been making apply to most gaming.  Just not all.</blockquote>\nI get it. I understand that "fair" here is saying, "Hey, we all can agree to use this third party, this impartial referee, a fair die roll on this random table, whenever I haven't explicitly defined what is there beforehand."<br/><br/>I don't define fairness that way. A randomly chosen result that doesn't make sense for a game is less fair, to me, than a purposefully result made-up by the GM that does make sense for the game.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm saying that it might be fair, but to me it isn't /good/. Other people want that impartiality.<br/><br/>When I'm GMing, I tend to be No Myth. I make most of it up on the fly. When I'm at my best, it comes out of a deep part of my subconscious, even to the point that it surprises me sometimes, or feels like I'm discovering it rather than inventing it. My wife (a traditionally published author) says similar things about her writing process, when she has "flow" moments, how characters write their own dialog. <br/><br/>Of course, I have to apply "hygenic" techniques to make sure I'm not forcing the players around.

Budget limit helps the GM indicate the players the real CR of the encounter.<br/>-Map contains encounters and obstacles that might be of a higher level than the party, but they know that from before (through rumours and clues in their way there) so they can decide if they venture into that place anyway or not.<br/>-If the GM doesn't know/ain't sure/still hasn't come up with something, she asks the players. If the GM finds the players idea troublesome to include, she states so or let them roll the dice to see if what they say is the exact true or if they are not well informed (but the truth still resembles what they said in some form)<br/><br/>Sorry, I'm still shooting a bit in the darkness with those ones, but I've got the feeling that the thrill of full myth you're looking for is a bit like chess, Greek Tragedy and Mc Gyver. in the sense that the fiction is in a fixed state before players reach the place (chess in the sense that both sides start on equal terms but one of them does the first move), so players can get there and try whatever they want (Mc Gyver). <br/><br/>Part of the thrill for the GM comes from her knowing exactly what the players will face (greek tragedy; the audience knows this will end bad but still watches until the end) but then being surprised that they take the elements and change the story into something completely different through wits or brawl. (Mc Gyver again)<br/><br/>As in chess there's the thrill of the intelectual challenge: who outwits who with the same elements; but it won't work if the challenge isn't in equal terms. In this paradigm making things on the spot gives the GM an unfair advantage or just plainly kills the thrill.<br/><br/>I'm probably still off of what you want for a mile but I think I get now that what you want and what we've been offering are widely different things because all GMs get their kicks from different things and full-myth and no-myth don't define nor get us any close to label what we actually like about doing prep or improvising on the spot.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446713/#Comment_446713" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T15:41:21+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  3:41PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm about transparency of process.</blockquote>I outlined the process because I thought it was necessary in order to provide an accurate picture of the outcome.

This gives the impression that there is in fact a true reality and correct answer and I already know it.  I am a qualified expert on the real place that is the game world.<br/><br/>4) The players will grow unhappy with any of these methods which shows any pattern of producing implausible nonsense.  "Simple statement" is on the shortest leash; most of my players are quicker to question a human than a table or written-down info.<br/><br/>5) When I state something with complete certainty, the players do not care about the process leading up to my statement.  However, if I state something <i>without</i> complete certainty, the players dislike having my process revealed to them.  There are various ways to hide my own uncertainty and thus keep the players happy, such as filling the time I take to think with habitual tasks like die-rolling or paper-flipping.  Having discussed this out of game, the players have confirmed that they approve of my illusions as long as they're successful.  Things like far-away glances which betray creative thought give the illusion away and are thus unwelcome.<br/><br/>6)  The players are happy to be asked for established fictional info, as long as I can seamlessly fall back to an appropriate Plan B if they don't remember the info. If they don't remember whether the info was ever established, I can look-up or roll. If they remember the info was established but not what it was, I must look-up.<br/><br/>7) I do not recall any methods not listed above that the players are also happy with.  They are not happy with any methods that transparently invent the game environment on the spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446734/#Comment_446734" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T16:57:57+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  4:57PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 5:01PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra, we cool?

Well, just to clarify my own experience, I'm not one of the folks who values good modeling and consistency as ends in themselves -- for me, they're always means to an end.  And in this case, the thing they produce -- a gameworld that feels like a place that really exists -- isn't even the ultimate point.  The <i>ultimate</i> points are out in the real world, when players in New York chat with players in North Carolina about different experiences in a place they've both shared, where one party's efforts are discovered by another party years (of real time, not game time) later.  It's not that the NY-NC chats happen often, or for most players; that's just a dramatic example.  Less-dramatic examples include remembering a game far longer than other games, chatting with fellow players about last session as if it was something you lived through together (as opposed to being like a board game you played or a movie you watched), or just being proud to have had an inn named after your character, moreso than in another game.<br/><br/>I won't try to sell you on this; if it doesn't appeal to you, then fair enough.

I think it's not hard to come up with something like that when reading it: Place a luxury lobby as the entrance of your dungeon complete with a carpet, old armors and swords on the walls or on the hands of each armor. Animate them when the players are close enough. It's the perfect combo: the carpet immobilizes and suffocates one PC, whoever hits it then deals half the damage to the PC and half to the carpet, animated swords and armor keep everyone busy or running, inmune to almost all effects, yet going out of the area is enough to get out of trouble actually.<br/><br/>On another use of the same trap, have the players find and armory full of dwarven plates. On the wall, put a sign in dwarven that reads "Dwarves don't forgive those who take which isn't theirs". Animate the whole armory when someone who isn't a dwarf takes anything away.<br/><br/>Also, I'd reccomend you <a href="http://www.onepagedungeon.info/" rel="nofollow">One page Dungeon</a> you can either use the dungeons there as they are or recycle some parts to make your own, there are a lot of interesting ideas there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446786/#Comment_446786" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T19:47:03+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  7:47PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I placed I think 64 immovable rods in a home-made dungeon -- all synced.

On my last D&amp;D session I included the Smurfs, by using a tribe of goblins painted in blue stripes <i>ala</i> Braveheart. Players didn't noticed until the goblins all went back into the forest singing... but you don't have to make the reference so obvious as me. Take the subway service and adapt it into your setting. You can decontextualize even smaller things to get something completely original. Like the spirit of German Patterson, a sailor that possessed a broken compass and now wants to guide you to his treasure, but keeps giving you strange directions though the way (just came with this on the spot thinking of a GPS)<br/><br/>-Get to know the base material as much as you can, then pick up two random things and try to connect them. Getting to know them helps you build connections easier, but just trying to find a logical way to make that connection is a great mental excercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446796/#Comment_446796" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T23:19:40+00:00" title="July 16, 2015 11:19PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 11:33PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm loving the discussion about useful and focused game prep. (I also echo Dave about dogs towns being a good example of lean and effective prep which combines some solid background with lots of room to improvise and adapt - that, to me, is a golden standard to follow. I posted earlier on how creative agenda is the key to figuring out which technique goes where; hopefully I don't need to repeat that.)<br/><br/>I want to mention a different angle on "why is no myth so awesome?".<br/><br/>You see, it's quite different for the player and the GM. For example, Dave is interested in creating a sense of reality for the players, but he doesn't appear to value that consistency himself. He's happy to make stuff up; he just won't show the players that.<br/><br/>His priority is on crafting an awesome experience for the players. He doesn't need to believe himself that the place he's describing is real: he accepts that it is a fiction which he uses in the service of the game.<br/><br/>I've played in games that are the opposite, though: the GM really wants to *believe* herself in the sense that the place is real. that GM might be really concerned with keeping notes and double checking facts in source materials, maybe even taking notes as she plays. Fidelity to this real world (e.g. Tolkien's middle earth) is the priority.<br/><br/>Getting a detail wrong is a failure in this person's eyes; it is a "real" place and it must be accurately portrayed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the players can be enlisted in the process of portraying that world, as consultants or creative collaborators. "What kind of armour would a Qwghlmian guard wear? John, do you remember this? Lucy, based on what you remember about their culture, what would you say?"<br/><br/>It's the complete opposite.<br/><br/>So there are all kinds of possible permutations. (At least 4 from the axes I discuss in this post, alone.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446797/#Comment_446797" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T23:30:04+00:00" title="July 16, 2015 11:30PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 11:38PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right. So why is it awesome?<br/><br/>I think it has a lot to do with willing suspension of disbelief, trust, and mental discipline.<br/><br/>As a GM, playing with a sense of full<br/>Myth (e.g. What's in the next room? I don't need to decide, it's on page 17...) allows you to relax contradictory desires or priorities. Relax mental discipline. You're just presenting someone else's material: you can relax and worry about presenting it well and being fair in adjudication.<br/><br/>If you're someone who worries about unintentionally railroading your players, being unfair, being perceived as being unfair, and similar things, playing from a Full Myth may be such a relief as to be borderline magical. <br/><br/>You can play with an easy confidence and a great feeling of freedom. (Some players are like this, too: they have more fun when someone else has told them what they're supposed to do - tell them that they can do anything they want, and suddenly the game is very stressful for them).<br/><br/>So, these techniques allow you to relax your mental discipline, anxiety, and so on. You don't have to worry so much, because you're just a referee and narrator.<br/><br/>As a player, a game based on a Full Myth allows you to stop worrying about how and why the GM is doing things. If you have a history of bad GMs, perhaps, you always worry about the GM making things unfair or giving you easy victories.<br/><br/>Knowing that the GM is playing Full<br/>Myth lets you relax any trust issues you have and just enjoy the game. It's easier to suspend disbelief if you think that the material isn't coming from your<br/>GM, or your GM's whims, but an authoritative source. That makes "constructive denial" easier, and allows you to suspend your disbelief with less mental dissonance.<br/><br/>There is some trust lacking. The player finds their suspicions of the GM's abilities or motives is distracting them from playing the game. The GM effectively says, "hey, don't worry. It's all coming from this source over here."<br/><br/>Now they sigh a sigh of collective relief and they can relax and play. The players find it easier to trust the GM and immerse in the game, and the GM relaxes because she is no longer worried about her own control tendencies interfering with the game, no longer worried about being judged by the players, and finds the mental discipline required to keep the game process "hygienic" to be much easier to manage.<br/><br/>So that's my take on it from the social dynamic angle. (The Big Model teaches you to look at the social layer as the outside of the onion, after all...)<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446800/#Comment_446800" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T00:37:04+00:00" title="July 17, 2015 12:37AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2015 12:37AM by Airk.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a counterpoint I don't think Full Myth provides even the slightest hint of protection from railroading.

Though if you know the players are going there ahead of time (because of scheduling) you can prep a specific place without worrying about luring players there. And from my perspective, stuff prepped ahead of time still can't take into account the players' reactions, which seems to be the crux of the matter.<br/><br/>Right now I'm understanding it as being analogous to taking satisfaction that a twist in a TV show was planned all along. If the shocking twist was made up out of nowhere, it's much less satisfying. It's why some writers take pains to reassure their fans that they have a plan. It's why the mystery writer in the classic whodunnit is supposed to show you all their cards and make the revelation hinge on facts that were already established, not brand new ones. (Sorry for using plot examples!) If the writer only decides who did it when they see the audience's reaction, that breaks the genre expectation.<br/><br/>You <i>can</i> write content that doesn't rely on a planned sequence or narrative.

That was sortof my argument earlier - that no one really plays completely No Myth for longer than a one shot, because it's virtually impossible to stop yourself from thinking, "Well, they're off to the Crypt of the Sorcerer King next. I bet there's...." but you can easily do a sketchy high level myth and then minimum-myth all the actual stuff that happens in play.<br/><br/>In fact, that's pretty much what Dungeon World tells you to do.<br/><br/>But again, this thread was, perhaps poorly, titled "Why is Full Myth so awesome?" not "What are some reasons you might want to use some Myth."  And I am still forced to maintain that true, honest to goodness, Full Myth... is just that.

His experiences are like dreams, but waking ones that feel real and in which he can control his actions and direct his adventures.

Maybe I haven't been making that point effectively, but I think you need to be looking less at all of these confusing and absolutist game design terms and more at "How much do I need to prep to run the best game I can."<br/><br/>So if it seems like I've been railing against you, it's because of the way you've framed this discussion as a choice between "don't even think 5 seconds ahead" and "PREP ALL THE THINGS" and seemed to be resisting my attempts to pull you into what I've always felt was the actual, useful intent of 'No Myth' - in that it doesn't mean "no planning ahead" but simply means that most stuff is going to be invented in real time (while 'leading the target') rather than days before.<br/><br/>So now I'm going to ask straight out - have you considered running a game in this fashion instead of your "absolutely no thinking ahead and make up everything only the very second that information enters the world" style of striving for some sort of "Absolute Zero Myth" play?  It just seems like you're rejecting a playstyle based on negative experiences trying to run it in an insane over the top way.

Barker's <i>Tekumel</i> games. The player said that they could ask Barker any detail about the world, and he produced an answer immediately, and it never seemed like he was making it up. Most likely, he made up a lot of it on the spot, but from first principles about what made sense in the world he'd invented.<br/><br/>I think the specific example in the article was about sexual practices involving wafers, or something, so it's not like it was going to be a life-or-death detail in a dark temple full of angry priests. (Though, the character could have been masquerading as a harem girl, so who knows?)<br/><br/>No matter. The player was marveling at how real this Tekumel world felt, as if Barker didn't have to make up details, but just try to remember what they were. That's Full Myth from the player side, but who knows what the GM was doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446871/#Comment_446871" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T17:19:55+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  5:19PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If Mr. Barker never stopped to look anything up, I consider it virtually impossible that he wasn't inventing stuff on the fly.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446877/#Comment_446877" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T17:53:18+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  5:53PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as the railroading issue:<br/><br/>I think it's totally orthogonal to prep or no prep.

Time, energy...<br/><br/>I have lots of memories from making characters, from the beginning of the session and up through the middle. This was 22 years ago, mind.<br/><br/>The next memory is a couple of weeks later. I'm reading the module and the gamemastering guide (neither of which I had read when making my character). I for the life of me do not get it. Actually, only now am I beginning to get it. She follows the module (a pretty railroaded affair, but hey, we were playing along) and filled in the gaps from her imagination. There weren't many such gaps though because we were on the straight track.<br/><br/>We didn't play again. (Maybe because I read the module? Don't remember if that was a factor.)<br/>Me and my sister started playing Hero Quest, the board game, instead. She was the overlord.<br/><br/>What I wrote in that last paragraph, I could not understand to do myself. I couldn't make that leap.<br/><br/>Well, you've heard the rest my gaming story many times and I'm always glad to tell it again. I ran games and played in games, telling her only that I did so, like "Oh, those guys? I met them from playing roleplaying games" etc.<br/><br/>But when the mirror story happened -- my second D&amp;D session and my first of many mindblowing events both as a player and as a DM -- I called her up and told it. I thought it was so cool, so real, I was so proud of how we had handled it.<br/>She was like "Huh. That's neat."<br/>I don't think she remember's the game we played back then.<br/>And I wish, I wish we had started with a better game. And I wish, I wish I had had more trust in her even with the crappy game to just keep on playing together, with the family.<br/><br/>I was embarrassed to play with my family, with my mom as GM, not because I didn't love them but because I didn't have a group of friends to do it with.

Tonight was the first night of a new campaign. Both character had ties to a band of bandits, one as a former member (still in good standing) and one as a bounty hunter targenting those bandits.<br/>I looked up the Raider tag in Red Tide and wrote down the ideas, thinking of them almost like elements in a fiasco game "Place: burnt farmstead. Item: Bribes to the raiders. Person: Bandit chieftain". I tied some but not all of my previously created and placed thieves in the city to this bandit gang. During the first part of play, I nailed some of these items down, writing them down. It's creating a richer, more detailed world.<br/>The players are aware of this process.\n<blockquote>1.

I apologize for not replying to it. If that's the post in queston, it resonates a lot with me. It describes the feeling as both as player and as GM well.<br/>Unfortunately I can't really rely on that "Hey, don't worry" because I fill in gaps a lot. When running a really good module, such as The Lost Mine of Phandelver, I could, and it was amazingly relaxing. Now that I'm running Princes of the Apocalypse, and when I'm running my own campaign, I can't. I've left more gaps (made bigger "blanks") than LMoP did, and so did Princes. So I have to mix in some made up stuff and some from tables and it's not as satisfying for me or for the players.<br/>But it's what I have to do in order to get the game going.<br/><br/>Like, an example from earlier tonight.<br/>They go to an inn. I roll up a random inn from the 5e DMG.<br/>I felt iffy about this. I don't know why...<br/>I wished I had remembered to prepare an inn before hand.<br/>I had made a rumor table, though, so while the patrons were on-the-spot-created, what they were saying wheren't.<br/><br/>But all this on-the-spot creation disturbs the relaxation you talked about in your post, Paul.<br/>On the other hand, having EVERYTHING prepped leads to something that is impossible to read and learn.\n<blockquote>2. Did you really call your mother to tell her about your new approach to prep?!?</blockquote>\nI'll tell the story about my mom and prep.<br/>My mom is really shy. We talk a lot, but... we mostly talk about me, about how I'm feeling. I don't know her so well but she knows me very well.<br/>She's only played RPG once. I was in the game -- my first game actually, and her first as well. (There were other players but also related to us! Family game night!)<br/>It was a BRP knockoff, using a module.<br/><br/>I don't remember why the session ended... maybe just because of time, maybe something else.<br/>She put a lot of work into it, reading the game master guide and the module.<br/><br/>When I later read that same material I was really confused. I had no idea how she had ran it because the module was so full of gaps, so weird, so much time skipping and I didn't understand it at all.<br/>I switched to playing the Hero Quest board game with my sister as the overlord (re-skinning the characters to make up our own backstories) and my mom never gamed again outside of like tricktaking card games and Scrabble.<br/>It's a sad story actually.<br/><br/>When I became grown up I started running games. When I was the GM, I ran No Myth. Inspired by Steffan O' Sullivan but taking it even further. (I didn't understand that even he prepped -- he talked about winging it in situations, I was winging it completely.) When I was a player, there was a cult of secrecy among GMs, so we couldn't learn from each other. The philosophy was that the GM is a magician and the players should just accept what they hear at face value and the GM should never reveal their many tricks. I ran diceless also.<br/><br/>I didn't really talk to her about how it was going, or tell stories from the games. I just said "Oh, we finally had another roleplaying night, I had a great time" and "Oh, those guys? I met them from playing roleplaying games." I played rarely because I had a low player retention rate and always had to start new groups, living in a very small city.<br/><br/>Then I heard a story about someone who did play with dice and rules and I got intrigued. I threw away my somewhat fun home-made no-myth games (I read a lot of GURPS modules but only for inspiration, for setting and mood) and started pursuing trying to learn how to run games. I didn't get it... I had bad experiences with SotC, Diaspora and Fate Core (I kept trying Fate because I love 4dF so much, it's a brilliant dice system).<br/><br/>When the "mirror story" happened, for the first time since I started gaming, I called up my mom and told her something that had happened in the game. She thought it sounded cool. We talk like six times a year or so. She doesn't really remember running that game almost 25 years ago. I wish, I wish we had started with a better game. I wish, I wish I had had more trust in her, she seemed to understand it better than me.<br/><br/>The "mirror story" was just the first of so many cool things that has happened since I started playing and running dungeoncrawl games. It was my second D&amp;D game, I had played in The Lost City just weeks before and had a good time.<br/>But the "mirror story" blew my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446899/#Comment_446899" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T20:19:08+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  8:19PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amazing story, Sandra.

So can you then understand the feeling of wanting to move towards the "more myth" point on the scale?</blockquote>\nYes and no.  The reason I react strongly against the idea of "completely no myth" is because I feel like it would just result in an incoherent game and also actually make the GM's life harder, because in striving for that "absolute zero" point, you throw out the ability to do all kinds of useful things like thinking ahead.  I'm essentially trying to approach this from a pragmatic standpoint - what are the gains and the losses for a given level of "myth".  Or to put it another way, I don't think either full myth, no myth, or anything in between myth have ANY intrinsic value.  The only value they have is in what they add or take away.   So the sort of "absolute zero myth" setup where the GM is "not allowed" to think ahead seems to take away a sense of a coherent world (because the GM is constantly working in, it seems, a vacuum) and adds extra workload for the GM because they are not "allowed" to use any of a large number of tricks to help themselves along. Since that is taking away something good (Coherence), and adding something bad (Work!), I don't see value in it.<br/><br/>However, I think that adding a relatively small amount of myth is all that is needed to avoid those difficulties, and beyond that point, no one has really been able to explain to what the added value is for introducing additional myth into the game - except in the obvious case where writing up tons of world info and the like is simply EASIER for the GM than making it up on the fly.  Hence my earlier comment about "Whatever is easier for you to run."  I haven't seen anyone in this thread with any solid examples of what actually changes at the table when you introduce more myth - your mirror example, for instance, is a classic case of it being exactly the same with minimal myth.  The PCs enter a room with a magical mirror in it.  The GM, in all but the most absolute-zero myth types of games, spend a moment and a half thinking about what that magic mirror DOES at the same time the party introduces it.  He should not be waiting until it is interacted with.  The mirror is there. It has been introduced.  The players can do whatever they want with it and it will still do whatever it does.  Yes, someone could argue "but the GM could change his mind between then and when the mirror actually does something" and I agree - but the GM could just as easily change his mind about the mirror if it was written down on a piece of paper in front of him.  That's the other side of this - there's a lot of mysticism surrounding prep, and fundamentally, prep is not sacred.  It is not immutable. It is no more real than stuff the GM made up two minutes before it appeared.  If I write down "the mirror petrifies the first person to look into it, then cracks and becomes nonmagical" in my notes, that has exactly as much binding effect on me as thinking it when the PCs enter the room.   It's not a shield.  I can't say "Well, I wrote it down, so I'm sorry I killed your character, but it's not my fault!"  I don't get to sleep better at night because I wrote it down.  Nothing changes.<br/><br/>At this point though, I think it's also important to note that "No Myth" doesn't mean "stuff changes willy-nilly all the time" - to cite the earlier example about the tavern with the low ceiling, and how "now we know that when we return there";  Once established, things stay the same unless there's a reason for them to have changed.  If orcs raided that village last month and burned down the tavern, maybe it was rebuilt with a higher ceiling - great - but otherwise, it stays the way it was, full myth or no myth.   The world has to remain consistent, independent of how much "myth" you put into your game.   Once something has been established in play, it has been ESTABLISHED.  The "Myth" is that stuff is established BEFORE it's encountered in play.   Once it's been encountered, it stays.  I assume that was a ground-level assumption of this discussion, but at this point, I'm leery of any assumptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447049/#Comment_447049" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T20:06:16+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  8:06PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent discussion. <br/><br/>I wanted to take a stab at answering the question of what's awesome about being closer to the 'full-myth' end of the spectrum, and one thing that came to mind was videogame sandbox gaming a la GTA.

The GM prepped a mirror. It did a thing.   That thing was supposed to impact the PCs? I guess? Because the mirror was a "Trap" in the GMs mind?  But... none of this has to do with the fact that mirror was pre-prepped or not.   The PCs used an object in an unexpected way, but that has nothing to do with whether that object was pre-prepped ("In room <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, there is a mirror of soul crushing!") or invented as the PCs arrive. ("Okay, what kind of crazy stuff does a mad wizard keep in his boudoir?  I bet his mirror is a trap for the unwary, so it'll be a mirror of Soul Crushing!") - the content, either way, is not being prepped with any intent that the PCs interact with it in any special fashion.  There is no difference between the two "approaches" here that I can ascertain.\n<blockquote><br/>To use a non-gaming analogy, think about movies so bad that they're good comedy.

Prepping in advance doesn't stop the GM from having intent ("Ooooh, if I put a mirror of magnification in room three, and a Lens of focusing in room six...") and creating stuff on the fly doesn't mean the GM has intent.

The only difference is the GM's experience in creating the trap: what did it FEEL like for her to come up with this mirror?<br/><br/>Doing it ahead of time is fairly "hygienic": she is, of course, at some level, putting it there in order to make the players' lives difficult, but it's almost as close as you can get to just stating objective facts about some fictional location.<br/><br/>If the GM is inventing the mirror trap just before the characters interact with it, she may feel some pressure to adapt it somehow to what is currently happening ("Oh, it looks like they're going to want to steal some treasure, and I'm hoping for a tense scene... should I make it a MORE DANGEROUS trap?"). It's possible to come up with methods not to do this kind of thing (e.g. rolling dice, principled GMing, and so on), but it's arguably a little more difficult to be detached than it is when you're prepping before the game.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, if you move the moment of creation PAST the moment of interaction - "Ok, I grab the mirror and look into it. What happens?" "Uh, well, let's see..." - this challenge becomes even greater. It's even more difficult now for the GM to remain "objective". She may have certain desires for the game to go a certain way, a desire not to hurt that player's character, or whatever else clouding her mental process.<br/><br/>Vincent Baker said it well a while back (many years ago): anything that's prepared for a game is an illusion. It's just a *plan* you have of introducing something-or-other. It doesn't become real until it is actually brought into the shared imaginary space in actual play. Until then it's just something you're maybe thinking of introducing to the game, but, as far as the game and its players are concerned, it doesn't exist.<br/><br/>Looking down at the paper allows you to hold yourself accountable, nothing more.<br/><br/>If it's your aim to hold yourself accountable, it helps. But, ultimately, there is no difference (to an outside observer) between playing a module written 50 years ago and inventing stuff on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447073/#Comment_447073" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T07:31:02+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  7:31AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even the "just enough myth" is way more myth than I used to use.

But having it be fully prepared as we enter the room, before we start interacting with it, is as you say, much better than it being decided after the GM knows what we're doing with it.

We once played Psychodrame in Dante's basement a few years ago!<br/><br/>So it seems to me this thread is about Scrap Heap Challenge. It's a show where the contestants get a mission and they have to build a machine from the stuff in the scrap heap. So there are three ways we could do this.<br/><br/>1: The scrap heap is just there, unrelated to the mission, and the mission is decided and they have to make a plan and find stuff that can be used and improvise and be creative.<br/><br/>2: The scrap heap has been prepped a bit by the "GM" (the production team) to include things that can be useful for the mission in question.<br/><br/>3: The "GM" looks at the plan the team is making and then places some relevant objects around the scrap heap where the team will find them.<br/><br/>1 is total creativity for the team. 2 is more of a "can they find the right pieces?" thing. 3 is illusionism. If the world has been prepped ahead of time, that's like number 1, and whatever the players do with the world is true creativity.<br/><br/>This actually makes me feel like playing a full myth game, and I'm pretty strict about my no myth preferences. But for me to enjoy it, it'd have to be number 1 above. There should be no scenario, no story, just challenges and a playground and I can take pieces that nobody else imagined would go together and make something awesome with them. I got this feeling long ago when playing the Swedish game "Mutant". It\xa8's a postapocalyptic game and a lot of the point is about roaming the forbidden zones and finding weird stuff from the past, like road signs and plastic spoons. We had a lizard-driven wagon that we over the course of the game reworked into a tank. We armored it with road signs and pieces of monsters we'd slayed, we built a catapult with surgical tubing and kitchenware. We'd build a distilling machine to make booze, which would be used to soak rags which were ignited with a toaster and launched with the catapult.<br/><br/>All of these things came from a D1000 list of random finds in the zone, and the GM never thought "I'll give them a toaster to light the rags with". We just found random stuff and were truly creative in what we could make with them. And it was awesome. It would have been significantly less awesome if the GM had decided what to give us. The fact that the stuff was arbitrary was a feature, not a bug, of using dice. We didn't want things that would be appropriate. We wanted things that were out of place and pointless, and we'd have to INVENT a point. And that was creativity and that was fun.<br/><br/>This seems to me to parallel the story about the mirror somewhat. The way the mirror was used was an invention by the players, not a purposeful design by the GM (or the dungeon designer).<br/><br/>And if that's the case, it can be done with random tables and little myth. And now I want to revisit that Mutant game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447080/#Comment_447080" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T08:37:09+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  8:37AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2015 8:44AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah what an amazing session and with such sweet players<br/>O Coco for ever<br/><br/>Of the three scrap heap challenges, I <em>only</em> like 1.<br/><br/>Otherwise, why even bother with magic mirrors and dungeons and stuff?<br/><br/>The appeal of no myth is that you can make stories about humans: like we did with O Coco.<br/>The appeal of no myth is not that you can pretend to play full myth.\n<blockquote>This seems to me to parallel the story about the mirror somewhat.

Prepping does not allow a GM to know what the exact game state will be in the moment before room <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is entered.<br/><br/>If the GM can create what is in the room in a way that is completely impartial to the game state as it exists, then i can see how there would be no difference in approaches. To me, the ability to do that seems questionable. I think that knowing what the PC'S situation is after the act of playing has created a specific context means that whatever you create will be affected by that context; even more so if you're deliberately trying to create a moment of cool. That does not feel organic or emergent.<br/>\n<blockquote>Sure, but again, this is orthogonal to prep or not. Prepping in advance doesn't stop the GM from having intent ("Ooooh, if I put a mirror of magnification in room three, and a Lens of focusing in room six...") and creating stuff on the fly doesn't mean the GM has intent.\xa0 ("And uh... all the trees here are made of ironwood!")<br/></blockquote>\nMaybe it is, but I'm not convinced at the moment. Both situations might have the same intent, but only one knows for sure what the game state is at the moment of creation. I don't think that a GM cannot not take the most current game situation into account when improvising: it will influence her creation regardless.Just-in-time creation does not have to anticipate that, but prep does. I think that the latter approach leaves more room for emergence to happen, because it can't always anticipate correctly, so something cool will happen because of the players immediate effect on a "persistent" world rather than as a result of their immediate effect on the GMs creative act itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447086/#Comment_447086" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T13:14:25+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  1:14PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2015 1:15PM by Dreamer.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> no real difference between writing down a mirror trap, and improvising one on the spot.

If they know you're winging most of it, it will matter to some because there isn't a persistent world in the notes or GMs mind where their in game actions have repercussions in that world, in some causal way. "The players did X over here and it actually affects Y pre existing element there." I contrast that with players having an effect on the GMs act of creation: "the players just did X,  so adding Y would be interesting." <br/><br/>I think it's questionable whether a GM can detach themselves enough when creating, so in that sense it's an issue of trust. I don't trust the human mind to be capable of ignoring all that context. It just isn't possible, IMO.<br/><br/><br/>"Vincent Baker said it well a while back (many years ago): anything that's prepared for a game is an illusion."<br/><br/>I would argue that everything including the SIS is an illusion. To me, a more useful distinction would be to say that changes to prep do not lessen some players' fun so long as they don't know it has been changed. Once they know, that type of player will find that their enjoyment is affected in the same way that retconning things in the SIS would affect others enjoyment. <br/><br/>Once the game starts, some players enjoyment depends on the expectation that that prepped elements will only change as a result of in-world actions that follow a line of causal logic. The PCs did X, so like a butterfly effect, the repercussions might spread to other prepped elements. This is lost when all the PCs can do is affect the GM's act of on-the-spot creation. <br/><br/>I hope I'm making at least a little bit of sense. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447087/#Comment_447087" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T13:43:30+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  1:43PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think that how the players experience the GMs act of creation matters to some players.

It's a learned instinct.\n<blockquote>I think it's questionable whether a GM can detach themselves enough when creating, so in that sense it's an issue of trust.

(Especially if you have an existing group or players and characters and a Situation, which you usually do.)<br/><br/>It's just a matter of degree. Somewhere it will cross the line for you. But the line isn't a "thing".<br/><br/>Causal logic, of course, is important. But, again, that's orthogonal to prep. You can use prep to ignore causal logic just as easily as the other way around.

It's a learned instinct.<br/></blockquote>\nI don\u2019t think that caring necessarily has roots in a negative experience. I think it\u2019s a matter of aesthetics. I can think that having my actions affect the GM\u2019s act of creation is cool in a different way from having my actions as a PC affect a prepped element in a logical causal chain that I won\u2019t see until I get to that affected element. I can appreciate the quick thinking inspiration that goes into the former, but I can also wonder at how pre existing elements interact in a logical fashion that was also unforeseen. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote>Indeed. Note that this is just as true for prep done in advance, however. (Especially if you have an existing group or players and characters and a Situation, which you usually do.)<br/><br/>It's just a matter of degree. Somewhere it will cross the line for you. But the line isn't a "thing".</blockquote>\nI think that there is an existing line between the state of \u201cgame session has not started\u201d and \u201cgame session is started\u201d. In the former, you lack the context that exists when you\u2019re creating in-game, so you are in fact completely detached from the in-game context that exists when the game starts.  You can try to anticipate it, but you can only guess what it will be. When you improvise on-the-spot, the game state is always available for you. If the players are privy to what you\u2019re doing, then aesthetic appreciation comes into the mix, IMO. \n<blockquote>Causal logic, of course, is important. But, again, that's orthogonal to prep. You can use prep to ignore causal logic just as easily as the other way around. (Like when a GM tries to "keep the game on rails" by inventing ever more unlikely explanations for things.)</blockquote>\nSure, but what I\u2019m trying to draw attention to is how causal logic is used in each approach. Improvising on the spot implies using causal logic on the act of creation: X happened, therefore Y should exist because Z. On the other hand, applying causal logic to pre-existing elements while you\u2019re in-game implies sussing out how actions on one element affect another: X happened, therefore Y is affected in this and that way because Z. <br/>\n<blockquote>Consider when you read a novel:<br/>Does it matter whether the author came up with the twist in chapter 27 (about what that mirror actually does!) while she was writing chapter 26, or before she started writing the book?<br/></blockquote>\nI agree with 2097 on this analogy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> A book is not interactive\u2026I\u2019m searching inside for why that matters to me, and these things come to mind:<br/><br/>-\tWhen the book is published it already has a causal logic chain planned out that you can\u2019t break anyway. Going in, I know that it\u2019s meant to be consumed that way. I can appreciate the cleverness of constructing the twist for me to consume it in order.  <br/>-\tWhen playing in a game, there may be a causal logic chain planned, which I can appreciate in the same way I would appreciate a clever series of events in a book. However, when I, as a player, am able to discover another causal logic chain that affects the existing elements in an unexpected way, it is a different appreciation. It\u2019s like, \u201ccool, we discovered something.\u201d<br/>-\tWhen I affect the GM\u2019s creativity, it\u2019s like \u201ccool, how she came up with that on the spot, in response to us doing X.\u201d If I don\u2019t know she\u2019s making it up, then I might feel like, \u201ccool, we discovered something\u201d\n<blockquote><blockquote>No analogy is perfect but this one was unusually poor.<br/>A <i>game</i>, especially with challenge elements, isn't a book.<br/>And it's as if they came up with the mirror while watching me, the reader, react to chapter 25.<br/>I want to inhabit a world not listening to a bed time story. Thanks</blockquote>\nBut can you tell the difference?  I'm really still unconvinced.<br/><br/>To me, this whole thing feels very artificial.  It's like "I can tell this food is organic by the taste!" when, honestly, I'm pretty sure you can't.<br/><br/>I feel like we should run some sort of study.  Except that we kindof already have, and we already know that players generally can't tell the difference unless the GM tells them.</blockquote>\nI think that the point is less whether you can tell the difference, and more about what it feels like once you know there is a difference. In the former, you\u2019re operating under certain assumptions, so when the curtain is pulled back, it can be a bit deflating to some people. It\u2019s like seeing the technique behind a magic trick: once you see it, it\u2019s not the same. What reaction you have to that knowledge will vary from person to person. Some people could feel somewhat disappointed at the loss of wonder (\u201coh, that was it?\u201d) and others could feel like, \u201cwow! that is pretty clever!\u201d, and I imagine all kinds of reactions and emotions not covered by those two.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447108/#Comment_447108" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T16:41:02+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  4:41PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm fine with the idea that people want to play the game in some specific way.  And that if you say "We are playing this game this way" that you bloody well play it that way.  I think that's something we can all agree on.<br/><br/>Where I start to get hung up is on the WHY you want to play it that way.  You can't say "It's on principle" here, because the principle is already out of the way - the principle is "You play it how you say you're going to play it."  What I am wondering is why people would have a stance on this if it has no impact on their game experience - and quite possibly a negative impact on the GM's experience, since now they need to spend a bunch of otherwise free time on writing stuff down for their game.<br/><br/>There isn't some kind of objective good in prep.  There just isn't.  And while people like to say that it's a question of not trusting the GM to be "fair" in making stuff up along the way, I think Paul has done a pretty good job of indicating that really, prep has at best a marginal impact on fairness - because planning to be fair is not the same as actually BEING fair.  Maybe it makes fairness more likely, but I don't really think the impact is as great as it is being represented. <br/><br/>In the mirror case both would've sounded the same in the ear but what we did, even the fact that we did something, that is way different. Way different.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I just can't see this. The fact that you did something is all on you.  As is what you did. The GM and their prep or lack of it doesn't even enter the equation in this kind of situation.  This isn't even a "GM fairness" situation.   This is "The GM put a thing there, and we did something cool and clever with it." Which is equally plausible in all kinds of games. Completely orthogonal to myth.   The GM made up that mirror.  You did something the GM didn't expect. Good on you.  The timing of when the GM made up the mirror has no impact on your actions, because, let's face it - even if prepped in advance, there is no way the GM was not thinking, at some level "This will be a cool thing for the PCs to interact with." OR "This is a thing that is appropriate to be here."  And the likelihood of him thinking one or the other of those doesn't change with prep.  There's no "fairness" to worry about here.  This isn't even a "We can't distinguish this via play" question, this is a "we can't distinguish this at all, ever."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447109/#Comment_447109" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T17:13:33+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  5:13PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone who says players can't spot GM improv is playing with players who don't care whether the GM improvises or not.<br/><br/>Players who do care?  Unless the GM uses certain techniques of delivery, those players can tell.  <br/><br/>I am not guessing, I am referring to decades of experience across hundreds of sessions.<br/><br/>Players care for all sorts of reasons, some of which suck.  But let's not confuse "that's a dumb thing to care about" or "my players don't care" with "no one can tell".<br/><br/>Paul and Airk, there's no reason for you to care about this if you don't want to.  Improvise away, and just avoid GMing for groups who are picky about their style of immersion (or have been scarred or whatever).  But if you think it's impossible for anyone else to ever know, you're fooling yourselves.  Humans are evolved lie detectors; this shouldn't be a shock.  Things like dragging syllables or searching glances register with us.  Paul, you tend to look down and repeat the beginnings of your sentences when you're improvising.

And I'm sure someone is going to step up and say "Well, you'll get fewer of them."   but will you?  I suspect that a GM who is accustomed to having heavy prep support who is forced to improvise because the players did something he didn't prep for is going to fail the "can I improvise this seamlessly?" test more often than a GM who is accustomed to making stuff up a lot from a relatively sketchy amount of preparation.<br/><br/>Here's the other thing.  We've had a lot of examples here of people feeling betrayed or cheated or whatever when the GM subsequently told them that stuff was improvised.  That means that those people were, in fact, unable to tell that it was improvised by examining the actual play experience.  I think this undermines the whole "players can tell" argument.  Has anyone had an experience where they could clearly tell a GM was improvising stuff? In a game where the premise isn't just "the GM should make up a bunch of stuff"? I mean, obviously, you can tell sometimes when the GM is making stuff in a PbtA game... but the game system itself FORCES the GM to make stuff up all the time.   Or maybe a better question is - has anyone had an experience where they could tell that the GM was improvising world stuff (as opposed to, say, outcomes of actions, which are pretty much improvised all the time, because there's no way to prep them.)?<br/><br/>I guess I feel like the whole "I'm in it for the immersion and it breaks down if I see someone improvising in front of me" stance breaks down in the face of reality and the fact that no matter how much the GM preps, they're going to improvising stuff all the darn time.  So it can't really be a question of "Is the GM improvising?" because the answer is always "yes".  (See my earlier assertion that "Full Myth" is in fact a myth because it's impossible.)  If it's impossible for you to maintain immersion in the face of a GM who makes stuff up, you'd never be able to maintain immersion. So there has to be something else going on here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447115/#Comment_447115" name="Item_202" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T18:05:40+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  6:05PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> This is "The GM put a thing there, and we did something cool and clever with it." Which is equally plausible in all kinds of games. </blockquote>\nMore like, "The GM put a thing in there, <b>with full knowledge of the state of the game</b>, and we did something cool and clever with it" The fact that, for example, the GM knows whether the PCs have one hitpoint left, automatically impacts the fairness of what they create. Will they throw them an encounter with a red dragon knowing that they're one hit point away each from a total TPK? Will they give them a break and throw a puzzle? Will they or not put an obstacle if they try to leave the dungeon? There's just not getting around the fact that when improvising in-game you have access to critical information affecting your decision. \n<blockquote>The timing of when the GM made up the mirror has no impact on your actions</blockquote>\n<br/>Let's say that the group's "dungeonator" had been destroyed. Would the timing of the mirror's creation have impacted the player's actions whether the GM created it prior to the dungeonator's destruction or after?   \n<blockquote>, because, let's face it - even if prepped in advance, there is no way the GM was not thinking, at some level "This will be a cool thing for the PCs to interact with." OR "This is a thing that is appropriate to be here." </blockquote>\nIt's not the intent what we are arguing about, it's the effects of timing given the context. With things that have been prepped, there is potential interplay that already exists between elements built in; like a ball at rest on top of the hill. When there is no prep, that interplay does not exist as a potential. Some people really like knowing that there is something like the former at play, some don't care, but there are differences to be appreciated.<br/><br/>In the mirror and "dungeonator" example, I can see how it would be extremely cool to look back and realize there were all these potential paths already set up by the situation. "If we had not gone into this room, we would not have had the mirror as a weapon against the toad" as opposed to, "If you hadn't made up the mirror as we entered the room, we would not have had the mirror as a weapon against the toad." The former hinges on the group's decision, the latter only happened because the GM decided to insert that just in time for us to find-- she could just as easily have decided to put it in the next room or in the hallway and we would still have found it because she found it cool. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how else it can be explained.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447116/#Comment_447116" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T18:11:43+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  6:11PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think there's also this thought that a good GM can make stuff up and it'll be just as "real" to the players as if a good GM (maybe a different one) did a lot of prep.

I feel like my point is getting lost here.<br/><br/>My point isn't that prep is bad or that no one can tell when things are improvised.<br/><br/>The point I'm trying to make is that it's the principle behind the thing that matters, not when it's created.<br/><br/>For instance, we can be playing along and come across a mirror. I can say to the players, "Hey, I wonder what this one does." Then I roll on a random table to find out, before they interact with it. Now it's "prepped", because I've settled on a function for the mirror before the PCs do anything.<br/><br/>Or maybe I've developed a whole system for how magic works, which I can use to decide what happens with the mirror. For instance, maybe I've established that in my world, the only way to access someone's soul is by looking into their eyes, and I've also established that demons can hide in mirrors. The PCs are hunting down a demon and they've narrowed down its location to this room. At that point I can roll a die to see if the demon is, indeed, hiding inside the mirror, and of course there will be some kind of interaction when a PC looks into the mirror (for which presumably the game we're playing has some kind of procedure; if not, we'd need more detail). I'm acting based on fictional causality and principled decision-making, and making it transparent to the players when it needs to be, so there's no deception.<br/><br/>(Dave, I believe this is what you do with your meta-magic system in Delve.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, I could be prepping two weeks earlier and thinking, "Hey, Dave is in this game and playing a Wizard. I know Dave likes things with runic inscriptions on them. So I'll say this mirror is covered in runic inscriptions. And I'll waggle my eyebrows at him and make it sounds really fascinating when he looks inside. And then! And then finally I can do that flashback where he's face-to-face with his mentor... yeah, that's the ticket!"<br/><br/>I could also carefully design the layout of my dungeon to make sure that the players go through encounter A first, then encounter B, and then circle back to their origin for encounter C, and I could keep refining that prep until I've covered every possible contingency, and the players, like mice in a labyrinth, go exactly where I want them to.<br/><br/>(I remember once writing up a con scenario which was essentially a murder mystery. I invented so much layered backstory and fictional detail that it would be absolutely impossible for the players to figure things out on their own, until I sprung the reveal on them at the end. Of course, at the actual table, the whole thing fell totally flat, because the players kept trying to discover the mystery on their own. When I kept "blocking them", I could very well point and point to my prep and say, "I didn't make this up just now!", but that didn't change how pointless the game felt to them.)<br/><br/>So I maintain it's more about a question of principled play than "improvised vs. prepped" - although the various comments about, for instance, improvisation being easy to spot, affecting gameplay, and so forth, are quite right. I'm just trying to shine some light on a different perspective which seems to be ignored.<br/><br/>Sandra is enjoying a feeling off "hands off the steering wheel", which allows her to be surprised by what happens in play. Prep is helping her get that feeling and discover a new sense of joy and freedom and relaxation.<br/><br/>I would argue, however, that someone in this position also needs to have other tools to handle those moments prep does not - and cannot - cover, so that s/he can handle those situations instead of falling back into whatever negative feelings or patterns came along with "No Myth play" whenever hir prep doesn't cover the current position, and completely freaking out (or at least losing the enjoyment of playing).<br/><br/><br/>(Massively cross-posted, of course.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447119/#Comment_447119" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T18:53:00+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  6:53PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2015 6:56PM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Where I start to get hung up is on the WHY you want to play it that way.</blockquote>\nFine, we can discuss that.<br/>Hell, I even started this thread for the very <em>purpose</em> of discussing that -- thence the "Why" in the title.<br/><br/>But in order for us to discuss it properly you need to throw away that bloody argument about "Maybe you can't tell, maybe you can't tell".<br/>Can we agree that that line of reasoning is well put in the ground?<br/><br/>WE CAN TELL BECAUSE WE ASK. BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT OUR PLAY<br/>\n<blockquote>This isn't even a "We can't distinguish this via play" question, this is a "we can't distinguish this at all, ever."</blockquote>\nWE CAN DISTINGUISH BECAUSE WE ASK. BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT OUR PLAY<br/>\n<blockquote>There isn't some kind of objective good in prep.</blockquote>\nI have noticed a subjective good in prep and I want to explore that further.<br/>The kicks.<br/>The same thing you've argued for with your "OK, to have at least some morsels of myth (preparing 30 s ahead), that's bloody obvious, no one is running preparing right the very second" statements.<br/>If that were true then obviously there is some good in deciding a little bit in advance.<br/><br/>That's your own case from earlier when you said Full Myth was dumb because everyone was running SOME myth because No Myth was super dumb.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Let us say we are playing a card game. A simple one... War. You compare cards, highest wins, go on til the deck runs out, the end.<br/><br/>In one scenario:<br/>Players reveal top card of the deck, compare them, the highest take both cards and put them on the bottom of her deck.<br/><br/>In the second scenario:<br/>One player reveals the top card, the other just (without looking) says one card. They try to do it with verisimilitude, they don't say queen of hearts a thousand times, they vary it with a little four of spades, three of clubs here and there.<br/><br/>Now, they can use this to win (say two of clubs when the opponent reveals an ace, say three of clubs when the opponent reveals a two).<br/>They can do it to lose, or to keep the game even or "fair".<br/>Or they can just try to make up what seems right because they don't want to spend a bunch of time reaching over and flipping over the card, they just want to hang back and say card names instead.<br/><br/><br/>All these very valid and fun and interesting forms of play. But NOT the same as actually turning over real cards.<br/><br/>I have impaired vision. When I have my glasses on, I see ok but I misjudge depths and it's like looking through a big ball of yarn. When I have them off, it's way blurry <em>and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference</em> between the real cards you turn over, or the made up card names you say. The two games would still be different games.<br/><br/>God, fuck... why do people always want to suck me into illusionism arguments!? I DON'T CARE. It's not relevant to how we play. If someone wants to do illusion with their group, go ahead, I'm not their players' champion. I DON'T CARE.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>We are playing a game, an activity, a fun pastime where the expressed pleasure is to interact with the prep/module/random tables (a la Simon's scrap heap challenge) and see what we can do with that "sand", with those seeds, with those limits.<br/><br/>It's not about a story, it's not about sight-seeing in the vistas of the GM's mind, it's about picking something up, something <em>that was placed there before</em>, and doing our best with what we find, with what's there.\n<blockquote>This is "The GM put a thing there, and we did something cool and clever with it." Which is equally plausible in all kinds of games. Completely orthogonal to myth.<br/>The GM made up that mirror.</blockquote>\nThe module writer put it there.<br/>Sometimes, the GM and the module writer is the same person. I honestly know two (very good) DMs who feel iffy about that, they prefer to run modules <em>for the express reason</em> that it helps them feel more objective, more like a judge in the battle of party vs module writer.\n<blockquote>The timing of when the GM made up the mirror has no impact on your actions</blockquote>\nAs we've said: If the GM had made up the mirror's effect after seeing us be careful with it, our actions would've been the same but our action's impact on the world, our footprint on the slimy halls of Barrowmaze, would have been different.<br/>If he had made it up after us tying it to our wagon, it would've been even differenter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"has no impact on your actions"<br/>Sure, that's true.<br/>In a three card monte game, trying to follow the queen... my actions is the same in a rigged and non-rigged game. I try my best to keep up with the moving cards and then make the choice where I think the queen is more likely to be placed.<br/>So whether the game is rigged or not has no impact on my actions.<br/>But whether the game is rigged or not makes a big difference on <em>the impact my actions have</em> on the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>SUPER IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:<br/>I'm using a lot of "cheating" metaphors here.<br/>I am not saying that it is always cheating to run No Myth.<br/>I am not even talking about social contract breaches.<br/>The point isn't "the GM promised us to play this way, they're not, so they're cheating, bad person".<br/>The point is: there are many kinds of games.<br/>In poker it is OK to bet high even though you have bad cards.<br/>But it is not OK to peek at your opponents cards.<br/>In chess it's OK to leave a queen threatened hoping the opponent won't see (if they're like a kid or so).<br/>In chess it's not OK to leave a king threatened hoping the opponent won't see.<br/><br/>In some games making up a mirror effect after the players triumphantly pull away the velvet cover when a toad monster is in front of the mirror is a virtuous, creative, beautiful move.<br/><br/>I am just saying that there exist a playable, interesting, very appealing game that's about exploring the prep.<br/>A game I love.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm not even making a point whether or not "it's evil to promise game A while secretly delivering game B."<br/>I'm just trying to make the point that game A exists, that game A is different from game B, and that game A is beautiful and I love it.<br/><br/>The second clarification:<br/>I'm back to comparing "making up the mirror's effect as the curtain is pulled" to "the mirror came from a module" extremes.<br/>This may seem like a strawman that will infuriate all "Some Myth"-proponents. "What about making up the mirror as the players enter the room? You exclude the middle".<br/><br/>Fine. I am pro Some Myth. I want myth. Let's have myth. Let's bring in that middle, it is cool. Let's experiment with making up the mirror (and it's full effect) a couple of rooms ahead, or when they enter the room, or when they notice that there's an object there. Let's try out different things. I am brave enough. ABT = always be testing. What I believe is that making up the mirror before even entering the level is the most awesome and feels the best. That belief can be disproven through testing. Science! So "Some Myth" is still a very interesting part of the scale.<br/><br/>But in Airks most recent posts they have made my strawman argument against No Myth come real, by going into "there is no difference, there is no objective good, you can't tell the difference, the only difference is principle and the principle is destructive to the GM". Such talk can only come from a heart that is truly against even Some Myth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447120/#Comment_447120" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T18:56:58+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  6:56PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Truth] I have played in good No Myth games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447124/#Comment_447124" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T19:36:57+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  7:36PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2015 7:46PM by Dreamer.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The point I'm trying to make is that it's the principle behind the thing that matters, not when it's created.</blockquote>\nI think random tables add a wrinkle to the discussion because they are impartial-- assuming they\u2019ve been prepped (there we go again!). They don\u2019t care about the context of the game. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the assumption of a mirror existing at all and that it does something, when that happens (before the game or during) absolutely matters in terms of what kind of enjoyment it brings to the table. \n<blockquote><br/>I could also carefully design the layout of my dungeon to make sure that the players go through encounter A first, then encounter B, and then circle back to their origin for encounter C, and I could keep refining that prep until I've covered every possible contingency, and the players, like mice in a labyrinth, go exactly where I want them to.<br/><br/> (I remember once writing up a con scenario which was essentially a murder mystery. I invented so much layered backstory and fictional detail that it would be absolutely impossible for the players to figure things out on their own, until I sprung the reveal on them at the end. Of course, at the actual table, the whole thing fell totally flat, because the players kept trying to discover the mystery on their own. When I kept "blocking them", I could very well point and point to my prep and say, "I didn't make this up just now!", but that didn't change how pointless the game felt to them.)</blockquote>\nInteresting examples, but I\u2019m not sure how prepped sessions that are so-so are proof that the moment of creation does not matter. The pre-existance of a coherent world and emergent interactions is itself part of the enjoyment when things go well. When you ad-hoc, that possibility goes out the window for the stuff that you're improvising. <br/>\n<blockquote><br/>I would argue, however, that someone in this position also needs to have other tools to handle those moments prep does not - and cannot - cover, so that s/he can handle those situations instead of falling back into whatever negative feelings or patterns came along with "No Myth play" whenever hir prep doesn't cover the current position, and completely freaking out (or at least losing the enjoyment of playing).</blockquote>\nThis I can agree with.

class="Message">\n                            My current approach to moderate prep goes something like this:<br/>- NPCs and NPC groups are given drives, goals, interests and a few have some specific plans<br/>- Maybe draw a relationship map, in addition to an area map<br/>- Locations are described sketchily<br/>- Any location bigger than a room has a small random table for details or encounters<br/>- Truly significant items/information are placed or noted down for later placement<br/>- Other random tables from the rules or supplements selected for support/breakouts<br/><br/>Now I have a "fishtank" (h/t to Rickard) with a bunch of free-moving objects (NPCs) in it.  I think about the types of actions the NPCs will pursue once gametime begins, but I do not specify them nor place them in any order.  I view the entire plotfield as an object-oriented tableau, not a procedural timeline.  When the PCs begin moving around, I periodically glance at my NPCs and decide - just one step at a time - what this NPC is doing or planning to do <i>right now.</i>  If the PCs wander around a lot, I start rolling random stuff and improvising based on location.  Sometimes information is discovered as it was placed (full myth), sometimes it's placed just when the PCs need it by putting it in a place or in the mouth of an NPC who's in a position to know it - this is what you might call "Flexible Myth" (the data itself is pregenerated but its location in the world is not decided until the data becomes pertinent to the fiction).<br/><br/>Note (as stated in the other thread) that I am willing to ditch my entire plotfield if the Players begin doing something interesting (to them) that lies in a different direction.  Random tables allow me to get sandboxy even when the environment isn't a true sandbox.  But since I know what my NPCs want, NPCs actions are still going to happen, whether or not the PCs are in a position to see or influence them.  If desired, these NPC actions often allow me to create signifiers that bring the PCs back into the main area of the plotfield again (perhaps "offscreen badness" like "Having escaped the Lich's patrols, you get to the home of your mentor and find signs of a struggle; you determine she has been kidnapped by the Lich!", etc).  But if the PCs have well and truly gotten away and are involved/interested in something else, I'll just drop the Lich story and go wherever they're going.<br/><br/>This is a compromise on prep: it has the potential for wasted work, but that wasted work is a quick sketch, not pages and pages of needless details.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447132/#Comment_447132" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T21:37:16+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  9:37PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2015 9:41PM by WarriorMonk.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please consider that for <i>some</i> groups of players, knowing something is being created on the spot AND yet not telling a word about it, is gaming etiquette.<br/><br/>For example, On at least three occasions on my D&amp;D 5e campaign, there weren't not enough players to face the session I had prepared. So instead of shrinking the dungeon so the PCs could face it, I gave them the choice to try and risk a TPK or play a flashback adventure that their characters had before the campaign. They choose the flashback, so I had to make a lot of stuff on the spot. Of course, I've got a ton of tools to improvise NPCs, dungeons and traps on the spot, I can pull a couple monster cards of the appropriate level and only make the simplest excuses for reuniting the party so things don't fall apart, but I also relied a lot on the players to help me with the excuses and dismiss everything that could break the immersion.<br/><br/>The result was a solid session; they had fun, traps were an interesting challenge, NPCs could have used a bit more of prep, but it worked and each short adventure inspired me to introduce some changes to the whole campaign's myth. Of course players knew I was making some things on the spot, but I tried and said my lines with confidence enough so at least they doubted if I wasn't using prep I remembered from another campaign with different players. <br/><br/>If I had told them during the session that I was making up things, despite being the obvious truth, it would had damaged the immersion they were trying to attain and keep with such effort. What I'm saying is that in a game of make-believe, it's both side's responsibility to keep the immersion. The GM telling players that this is all a lie is being rude; not as much as a GM who forces the players to believe his lies and robs them of coices, but at least as much rude as a player who can tell his GM is lying in an effort to keep the game going and yet ruin the session calling her a cheater.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447134/#Comment_447134" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T22:00:41+00:00" title="July 21, 2015 10:00PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you run a campaign long enough, or if you run many different types of games, or if you do hybrid gaming, weird circumstances and subtle GM dilemmas will always eventually arise.

You are frustrating me also, but I'm trying my best to be level and clear here, and I think these distinctions are important.  I am sorry that you don't.   I believe the games are the same.  If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it doesn't matter if it hatched from an egg or was spawned from a replicator, it's still a duck.<br/><br/>I think we're also falling prey to terms again.  I have been arguing against 'pure no myth'  here - by which I mean 'No forward planning, no thinking about anything until the very moment it HAS to come out of your mouth' - in part because I think it seems like needless work for the GM, who has to actively struggle to not do those things, and in part because I think the actual INTENT of "No Myth" is not "no thinking ahead" but simply that things can change as long as they haven't yet been established by play.  Which is to say that, if you want, you can have "some" myth there.<br/><br/>There are advantages to prep.  It has not been my intention to ever assert otherwise, but I have been very frustrated with the examples people have been using because I view them as false.  We have established one very good benefit in the form of Mysteries.  Prep can also be useful if it's how your mind works, if you like thinking about the game outside the game, if you are trying to track situations or actions that are too complicated to conveniently keep in your head, or if you you think writing things down keeps you honest.  But I rebel against the idea that somehow the players achievements (Such as using "The Mirror" creatively) are somehow different if the GM wrote something down vs the GM making something up 30 seconds before it appeared.<br/><br/>That's it.

The GM might make something up that's relevant to the situation, to the personalities of the characters or players, to the overall plot arc. The GM might make something up that fits. She might think "Jenny's character has self esteem issues, so let's make a mirror that shows you looking really ugly" or "The group has been having problems with fire elementals, so I'll have them find an ice sword".<br/><br/>That's the difference. What Sandra wants is something without intention, without a plan for how it's to be used, to how it fits. Because if there's no intention, anything the players do with it will be their idea, their invention, their creativity, their luck. Not the creativity or planning of the GM.<br/><br/>Obviously this is not all down to prep. Putting an ice sword in room 4 and fire elementals in room 5 would be the same thing, which I'm guessing Sandra would also find off-putting (correct me if I'm wrong here, Sandra). But planning is definitely a part of it, because of the "mental hygiene" issues discussed above. Whereas if there's an ice sword in one dungeon and fire elementals in another dungeon from another module by another author, then that's emergence, and luck. And that's different.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447273/#Comment_447273" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-27T16:27:20+00:00" title="July 27, 2015  4:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I think we're also falling prey to terms again.

It's just as bad to refrain from giving the group an ice sword because they would need one. The point is that if the group does find an ice sword, it's down to luck, not design. It's like the people talking about metagame information. If I know there's a trap but my character doesn't, I can only choose to avoid it or walk into it.

The writing-down helps, and coming up with the idea before the players interact with it helps, but ultimately just one or the other can be sufficient, and, ultimately, all that matters is that you have the right combinations of principles and mental discipline.<br/><br/>This is why I posed the "telephone GM" thought experiment earlier: if someone else was coming up with the material, and you were just presenting and adjudicating it, would that be just as fun, or not? I think your answer reveals quite a bit about what particular kind of help *you* need, and which parts of the equation you care about.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nTo me, the telephone gm would be OK as long as he isn't being told what the players just did, or as long as he is detaching his decisions from what the players have done up to that point.

The point is that if the group does find an ice sword, it's down to luck, not design.</blockquote>\nHow about just giving them one when it makes sense and there is a reason it would be there?   This, to me, is the only acceptable reason for something to be there. Not "because I rolled it" - why would the ice sword even BE in the fire dungeon? And not "because it's in the module" either.  Running a 3rd party module just means you're passing the buck here, which to me, is a pointless measure.  It's like saying "I was only following orders!" as a way to absolve yourself from guilt. <br/><br/>And anyway, running a third party module doesn't mean the sword is "luck, not design" either - it just means that someone ELSE designed it that way. \n<blockquote><br/>It's like the people talking about metagame information.

This is getting kindof contrived and it just makes it seem like people don't trust THEMSELVES.  Which is funny, because of all the discussion about trust in this thread. <br/><br/>Do you really have so little idea what you "would have done" in normal circumstances?  If your standard procedure is to check with your 11 foot pole, you should probably do that, but if this isn't something you normally do, you probably shouldn't suddenly say "Y'know, it's been a while since I tapped the ground it front of me with my 11 foot pole..."  Are people really this mistrustful of themselves?   I have trouble understanding why a person who can't trust themselves to have an honest idea what they might have done would, say, trust themselves to not cheat at dice.  They seem so rooted in the same fundamental issues.<br/><br/>Edit: And NO, I'm not saying that people who need to rely on prep are cheaters or something.  I'm actually more curious - do people who rely on lots of prep WORRY about cheating?  I seem to recall 2097 having strong feelings on the topic of fudging?  <br/><br/>Maybe it's all just comes down to trusting yourself or not.

It's a Low Myth example rather than No Myth, because this is what happened.<br/>The players came to a well where they witnessed a big crocodile who was putting a lid on the well using its crocodilian paws. We were playing diceless and rules-less.<br/>Here I low-mythed a bit (instead of No Myth) and decided "If someone confronts the crocodile, they'll be killed. It is stronger than them" in my head. This was your typical "30 seconds ahead" example.<br/><br/>By the way, this whole example is gonna be pretty low on player agency -- that was a problem that was typical to my no myth / low myth days (but not necessarily a problem of <em>all</em> no myth play, contrast mine and Simon's O Coco game which had lots of agency and surprising twists).<br/><br/>One PC did go up to the crocodile and try to fight it. I said "OK, the crocodile kills you", in line which what I had decided earlier.<br/>He said "No way" and looked angry.<br/><br/>I was like "Oh..ok.... uh... he bites your arm off, then!"<br/><br/>He said "That's bull shit!" and I backpedalled once more to "The arm doesn't come off completely, it's more like a ring of teeth marks around the arm socket. You're gonna get scars but the arm itself is intact".<br/><br/>Right then and there I thought deep in my dark heart: "Diceless no more!" but it took me another several years until I also realized that I needed more prep. Just deciding on the spot that the crocodile has a d100 rather than a d12 in whatever stat still has the same problem as just deciding on the spot that the crocodile will kill rather than scar the PC.<br/><br/>But back to the point of the example:<br/>Prep is social armor. If you want to portray a living and dangerous world to interact with meaningfully, it's very hard to do that without something written down.<br/>If players these days would dare to try to pull off something like that player that just wouldn't die to the crocodile, I could point to my prep that said "See page this-or-that in the MM, but there are five of them" and then look in the MM and see "The this-or-that monster really has that stat!".<br/>\n<blockquote>The problem is that people keep showing up with bad examples.  A GM who is prepping a scenario the week before will still know about Jenny's character's self esteem issues, and the problems the party has had battling fire elementals.  Okay, MAYBE not the fire elementals, if they're only encountered that one evening, but "let's not give them a weapon that is expressly designed to fight the foes they've been struggling with for the last ten minutes" strikes me as the most trivial form of self control imaginable, so...<br/><br/>I guess what it all comes down to is that I agree in principle, but have found very few instances where I agree in practice.</blockquote>\nPrepping week-by-week instead of prepping the whole game world (and tables) upfront is something I do, but it <em>is</em> a significant compromise. It's not my ideal and I can see lots of similar problems like the afore-mentioned "strong-against-fire" weapon.<br/><br/>Arguing from a position of extreme skill at compartmentalization and psychological strength and objectivity and neutral point of view is something that is very far from the DM's I've played under. I've witnessed plenty of problematic calls in that vein.\n<blockquote>Right, which is why it's been suggested that it's even better to be playing a module designed by someone else. Prepping your own stuff is not as good, and making it up as you go even worse.<br/>[...]But that's also taking into account what has happened. It's just as bad to refrain from giving the group an ice sword because they would need one. The point is that if the group does find an ice sword, it's down to luck, not design. It's like the people talking about metagame information. If I know there's a trap but my character doesn't, I can only choose to avoid it or walk into it.

Thank you Simon.\n<blockquote>Running a 3rd party module just means you're passing the buck here, which to me, is a pointless measure.</blockquote>\nIt significantly transforms my role from "uneasy mix of adversary+referee" to just "referee".<br/><br/>This is golden dynamite folks. This thread paid off, after all -- I am getting some insight in why lots of myth is so awesome.<br/><br/>This is something I'm gonna put in a cross stitched tapestry in the hallowed halls of gaming along with Czege's and Lumpley's principles:<br/><br/>"Having lots of prep significantly transforms the DM's role from 'uneasy mix of adversary+referee' to just 'referee'."<br/><br/>This principle is called: "The tangible system principle".<br/><br/>This "lots of prep" can take the form of fronts, moves, prepared 7-9 choices, agenda, and even the entire managed conversation structure in Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>It can also take the form of a detailed, jaquayed, trap-filled 3rd party D&amp;D module, or roll-tables, or a hex map.<br/>\n<blockquote>Maybe it's all just comes down to trusting yourself or not.  And if writing stuff down helps you trust yourself, go for it.</blockquote>\nThere's another component and that's the players trust.<br/>No, not "trust that you're not cheating, trust that you're not fudging or forcing", but "trust in that their actions have real consequences and their choices have real meaning".<br/>If they can trust in the "system", the social armor that the rules and the prep provides, if they can trust in the feeling that they are interacting with something tangible, something with consequences that they can't plead with or be manipulated by... awesome gameplay happens. Like Simon's toaster lighter or our mirror.<br/><br/>I was watching Swan Song earlier this morning, I'm still catching up and I'm only at week 14, which I just finished.<br/>Without spoilers, I'll say that the crew was in a situation that was very high stakes.<br/>In that situation, I really missed having a very clearly rules-managed way of resolving those high stakes. Instead, it seemed like Adam was very much winging it with die rolls that didn't seem to matter. There were some jawdroppingly awesome roleplaying and social moments, and within <em>those</em>, real choices were being made, but there were also some die rolls that were just like "Why did you even roll that, if there was no consequence to the roll?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447344/#Comment_447344" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T15:22:26+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  3:22PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here I low-mythed a bit (instead of No Myth) and decided "If someone confronts the crocodile, they'll be killed.

Like you, I'm happy to challenge and be skeptical of play styles that seem weird to me, but at the same time, I try not to conflate my own preferences with some sort of objective correctness.  If you have no interest in ever playing the "trust a page in a module more than anyone at the table" game, cool, but that's just your preference, even if other commenters haven't yet described why it works for them to your satisfaction.  The proof is in actual play -- if it <i>does</i> work, then it <i>is</i> a good technique for <i>them</i> in that situation.<br/><br/>I say this only in hopes of forestalling the next round of "but that's nonsense"/"no it isn't" frustration.<br/><br/>Here's something I'd like to respond to, which also happens to be a perfect example of what I'm talking about:\n<blockquote>How about just giving them [an ice sword] when it makes sense and there is a reason it would be there?   This, to me, is the only acceptable reason for something to be there.</blockquote>Right: <i>to you</i>.  This is a statement of taste.  In the context of varied play priorities, there are a million other acceptable reasons for an ice sword to enter the fiction at any given point, e.g. "it's fun", "it's hilarious", "it opens a mystery", "you earned it", "you just spent the points on it", "it reveals a new side of the setting", "it's part of a specific person's vision which we're exploring", etc.<br/><br/>Maybe you're already on board with this.  But maybe not:\n<blockquote>Running a 3rd party module just means you're passing the buck here, which to me, is a pointless measure.  It's like saying "I was only following orders!" as a way to absolve yourself from guilt. <br/><br/>And anyway, running a third party module doesn't mean the sword is "luck, not design" either - it just means that someone ELSE designed it that way.</blockquote>Agreed, it is a result of someone else's design and a form of deferring responsibility.  These are often functional practices.  Just because <i>you</i> don't use them in this way doesn't mean there's guilt that needs to be absolved.  (If you want Simon to explain what he gets out of these practices, cool, but I'm kind of struggling to read you that way -- sounds more like just "no, you're wrong" to me.  If that's my misread, then I apologize, but I don't think I'm the only one in this thread who's taken your comments that way.) <br/><br/>My perspective on deferred responsibility is that it can be vital to:<br/>1) Making the RPG experience more game-like<br/>2) Relieving social burdens<br/><br/>It is completely possible to roleplay with no system beyond "player narrates actions, GM decides outcomes".  I've done this and enjoyed it greatly.  It is a very specific sort of feedback, though, with players free to interpret the GM's statements in various ways, from "I'm discovering the fiction-based principles by which the GM adjudicates" to "my friend likes me."  In a free-flowing exploration where we're all just enjoying roleplay for a sense of transportation or creative release, then this tends to be just fine.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, if there's a game-like pursuit of a goal where success is not guaranteed, then pursuing success quickly gets tricky.  Suddenly it <i>matters</i> whether we're system-learning or people-reading.  And not everybody who'd be on board for one is on board for the other.  <br/><br/>Accordingly, we get an infinite number of techniques for "passing the buck" -- everything from elaborate pre-written campaigns to the simple practice of rolling dice.  A <i>huge</i> percentage of RPG system design is exactly that: ways for the play group to defer responsibility.  Many gamers seem to find it less creatively taxing, and feel that they're getting more bang for their buck, both in terms of "I paid money for a game" and in terms of "this game is unique and not just what my friends and I would have made up independently".<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say that every roll-on table in a module is actually a <i>good</i> roll-on table.  There's plenty of awful game design and module design out there.  I'm just saying that "let the module decide", like "let the dice decide" has its proven advantages for those with certain (common) preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447358/#Comment_447358" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T18:11:34+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  6:11PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting (and excellent) discussion. <br/><br/>Here's the best summary I've seen so far (at least in terms of what I've been trying to say:\n<blockquote><br/>Maybe it's all just comes down to trusting yourself or not.  And if writing stuff down helps you trust  yourself, go for it.</blockquote>\nThe crocodile example is quite good. It wasn't made on any kind of principled basis, it wasn't communicated to the players, and it didn't present any good choices. The right expectations just weren't there (clearly the players didn't think death was on the table).<br/><br/>For instance, if the game was Call of Cthulhu, and the characters were hapless, human investigators, that same outcome might have been just right. (Whether it was improvised or not.)<br/><br/>I've seen just as many module-writers (or GMs preparing their own material) doing the same thing: arbitrarily deciding that a certain challenge can't be overcome. ("I don't want  the PCs going through this door, so I'll say there's a huge monster. They're first-level, so 4d6+13 damage, AC -4 should do it.")<br/><br/>What makes that OK in some games is not the nature of the monster/challenge. It's correct expectations. When you run a module, you say, "OK, I'm running this module, and there may be opponents you can't overcome. I'm not gonna fudge in your favour; it's up to you whether you decide to face mortal risk."<br/><br/>Right?<br/><br/>Clearly you did not do that in this game. If those expectations had been there (like the way they can often be assumed in a Call of Cthulhu game, zombie apocalypse, or a similar "instant death" genre), I'm sure you wouldn't have had a problem with the players.<br/><br/>But the other side is that *you* didn't like how it felt to make that call. It was creatively and socially uncomfortable. (I know that feeling very well!)<br/><br/>Relying on prep can really ease this aspect. But, of course, only if the right expectations are there and the prep itself is principled in some way.<br/><br/>(Consider a D&amp;D game where a GM stats up an NPC to be unkillable, completely outside the scope of what's expected: most monsters and adversaries have been 1 HD to 3 HD creatures, and the players are all first level, but the GM decided in advance that her favourite NPC has a ridiculous armour class and 4,000 HPs. The players will be just as likely to call shenanigans unless the fact was somehow communicated in advance, even though it was "prepped".)<br/><br/>As a player in *any* game, I always want to know what the risk level is - what's at stake - or, failing that, I need to know very explicitly that I do not and will not/cannot know the risk level. Just playing a game which seems pretty safe and then someone suddenly announcing I'm dead is, of course, going to cause some very unhappy reactions. That's not playing fair!<br/><br/>You also make an *excellent* point about a different sort of trust: "Do I have a real chance of making an impact on the game through my choices?"<br/><br/>This is another thing where, sure, prep helps to a certain extent, but still isn't the crux of the issue. <br/><br/>I still have to develop trust in the GM and in the processes of the game over time, prepped or not. If one dungeon has a deadly mirror, and another contains a special artifact which allows you to look through someone else's eyes, I can try to use that to defeat the mirror trap. But the GM still has to make a call! She can't just blindly rely on the prep, not every time. No prep can be that thorough.<br/><br/>A principled GM will do so in some way which I can understand and trust. A bad GM might go too easy on me (sure, anything you try works and you always succeed!) or decide to make a ruling that this artifact doesn't interact with this mirror: seeing through someone else's eyes still exposes you to the effects of the mirror trap.<br/><br/>At some point in the game, the GM has to judge player plans. At some point in the game the GM has to decide whether certain player actions have long-term consequences or not.<br/><br/>Did something we did have an impact on the wider world? Can I make a mark on this situation? Do my actions matter?<br/><br/>Trust in the GM has to be developed no matter what. A GM has enough powers to screw you over no matter how good the prep is. There is always a believable ruling within reach which could be unfairly in your favour or not. (An excellent example is a Charmed monster who is now an ally of the players. It's actions can't be prepped in advance; you, as GM, have to set some kind of principles for yourself to adjudicate its actions, and then stick to them. Over time, the players see whether you stick to your principles or not, and trust develops - or doesn't.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447361/#Comment_447361" name="Item_236" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T18:21:30+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  6:21PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the advent of explicit conflict resolution and stake setting was an attempt to cover some of that.

Basically, task dice influence conflict dice, and for each task performed, we see how that changes the overall situation on various scales.

This play style does not require that players can "lose" and be disappointed. The D&amp;D-type play style, however, requires there to be a real risk of failure for the victories to be meaningful. I think this is important. The prep will then be a way to make sure that the GM can feel like an impartial arbiter and the players can feel this, too. When success or failure occurs, it's due to the actions of the players, to chance, and to the consequences of the imagined physical reality of the game world. It's not due to the social reality around the table, or the dramaturgical rules of how stories are supposed to work. And <i>even if this had been true without the prep</i>, the subjective feeling of impartialness would have been different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447401/#Comment_447401" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-30T07:45:50+00:00" title="July 30, 2015  7:45AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds spot on                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447402/#Comment_447402" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-30T07:49:48+00:00" title="July 30, 2015  7:49AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            However, O Coco did end in a victory.

But then even if the story is mostly a GM fabrication dynamically adapting to PC actions, it seems to be not enough. There has to be a sense of "<b>objectiveness</b>" that validates PC choices as good or bad. It's a puzzle, with maybe lots of possible solutions that are better or worse depending on the situation and the personal stakes involved... but a puzzle, a challenge, nonetheless.<br/><br/>And the general consensus seems to be that more-Myth helps to perceive such elements as present in the game.<br/>But maybe that only because, as far as I know, there are very few no-myth games with a focus on solving challenges.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about all the GM-Less games I know, and they all focus on "drama"... having a good dramatic story emerge from gameplay. And of course there are challenges and failure and death, but they are not the point, just tools to drive the drama home.<br/>But you see how in such games FAIRNESS would be absolutely useless, and its lack is actually the engine of many events! <br/>You see how the judgement calls work on completely different assumptions: something might be judged as OK not because it offers the best logically-imagined-performance but because it provides the most compelling plot twist!<br/><br/>I'm thinking of Polaris, SHOCK, Fiasco, The Quiet Year, Dog Eat Dog, etc...<br/><br/>If this theory is right, then maybe Sandra (and the others) might find the same things they enjoy in full-myth games also in no-myth games, provided they are of the right kind, offering mechanics and structures that support THOSE values they are looking for.<br/><br/>Am I completely off track here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447414/#Comment_447414" name="Item_244" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-30T16:53:26+00:00" title="July 30, 2015  4:53PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's exactly right.<br/><br/>Sandra (2097) is operating from the assumption of a sandbox adventure game which challenges the players.<br/><br/>To be able to create and adjudicate challenges "fairly" (and without biasing the flow of events too much in any particular direction), it really helps to use some no-Myth techniques.

I remember breaking the balls of a GM in an oooold Forgotten Realms campaign because I read something about Netheril and it was all vague and mysterious and full of the promise of power... and I wanted to go explore, find answers, discover what was what.<br/>But he was not into it, and his story was going somewhere else anyway, so yeah he dropped here and there a hint for my sake, but we both knew that things wasn't going anywhere... and it was very frustrating for me.<br/><br/>Also, I like to feel clever and <b>exploit stuff</b>, be creative.<br/>I loved creating (in D&amp;D3.whatever) magical items out of low level spells (and I mean very low, cantrips and lvl1).<br/>At 3rd level my fellow wizards were able to cast a fireball and spent their money on some cool items that gave numerical bonuses here and there (rings, wands, armor).<br/>I instead got me some Create Wondrous Items talent and spent a FRACTION on what they spent  to create one or two items with a combination of cantrips and lvl1 spells ... they got a fireball? ... so what, I was literally a superhero! (still dead in a physical fight, but I could usually smart my way out of those)<br/><br/>I am the kind of player that when confronted with a huge knight in shiny armor thinks of throwing water all around and zap him with an abismal low level electric blast of some sort... and <b>expects</b> to get the <b>logical</b> result... and let the standard 1d4 damages go to hell.<br/><br/>I once wanted to have an Harry Potter rpg just to test out an idea I got:<br/>in that world Wands are both an enabler and a catalyst for magic; and are somewhat living, with a mind of their own; but are just an item that can be broken, stolen and most of al disarmed... there is a specific spell (expelliarmus) to do just this one thing!<br/><br/>So... HOW exactly is a wand made? Could it have a shape that is not wand-like? Can it be pulverized and made into ink? Can I tattoo a "wand" on a wizard? Can the wizard's body BE a wand? Etc...<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>Now, answering by myself to such questions is absolutely NOT fun (for me).<br/>I need external validation.<br/>I need an authority figure to waves off the stupid 1d4 damage and say "<i>the shiny knight is at your feet, indeed unharmed, but zapped unconscious</i>".<br/>I need an external source of lore to tell me all about the mysterious Netheril.<br/>Etc...<br/><br/>Yes, I might have my own expectations about such things.<br/>I might like to contribute with ideas and details to the world, here and there, IF and WHEN I feel inspired.<br/>But to explore something it has to be unknown to me, external.<br/><br/>Now, in most gm-less games that I played so far this things don't really <b>feel</b> the same. They are there, you can explore and exploit and have creative ideas... but it <b>feels</b> different... for all the reasons explained in the past 5 pages.<br/>The games I played all focused on telling/living together a compelling and dramatic story: Fiasco, Shock, Polaris, Montsegur, PsiRun, even Hell For Leather.<br/><br/>I <b>love</b> those games.<br/>But the feeling was different.<br/>This is why I came up with a couple of games that could allow me to<br/><b>play with worlds, roles, personalities, interactions and interesting devices and traps</b> ... but at my conditions:<br/>- gm-less<br/>- zero prep<br/>- clever ideas beat number crunching any day of the week (or even better, avoid the conflict between the two things and have clever ideas translate to better numbers, and numbers encourage clever ideas)<br/>- unexpected turns of events, mysteries, plot twist... that actually make sense... random elements that end up looking and feeling as if someone plotted them with care all along <br/>- and some other stuff<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe with THAT kind of structure to support actual play at the table, even a gm-less no-myth game could feel (almost, kind of, pretty near) like a full-myth game? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>[moved the game links on top for clarity]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447515/#Comment_447515" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T03:31:36+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  3:31AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I can relate to a lot of that description, as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447521/#Comment_447521" name="Item_253" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T06:16:10+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  6:16AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting.

But creating all that means a crushing amount of prep, unless there's a trick for it, one (or a few) which it seems you know of. Care to tell us a bit more about it? I've got a few of my own too, for example:<br/><br/>-I've designed a deck of cards with several random tables, that allow me to make clever traps on the fly, along with random dungeons. It's system-agnostic since it creates the traps around 2 things: the trigger and what the trap does. Rooms need three things: a shape, what and where is the exit, and a detail for players to find if they search the room (which may or may not be connected to the trap). I've got good results using this while playing but it doesn't mean you can't use this for prep and write down everything you get.<br/><br/>-The first deck I designed, which I called the <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">ResourceFULL deck</a>. It's meant to throw random words and images at you as inspiration to create places, characters, plot twists and more. Again, it's both a tool that can be used while playing or better, before the session to make the prep more coherent.<br/><br/>-I'm still working on a complete set of monster cards for 5e. When I'm done, I'd probably shuffle them, draw 5 randomly and try to write a chain of events to relate them to make an adventure. May or may not work, but I've gotta try it anyway.<br/><br/>-Pathfinder's Gamemastering guide has great advice on making your prep and some really nice random tables to help you there. Also, the Harrow deck from PF is an excellent tool to "read the cards" for a character and make up an obscure fate for them, that can give the player some direction to explore the sandbox, instead of going around aimlessly.<br/><br/>-For my recent game, Offline, I created an 8 question procedure for players to brainstorm a kingdom. It usually ends up giving the GM the premise of an adventure, complete with map,  good ideas for places to explore and things to happen, as well as a starting point for the players and a good idea of where to go, mostly made up by themselves and a few dice rolls.<br/><br/>So far, the crushing amount of prep for me has been to create and/or get together all these tools, which even in their actual unrefined state help me a lot to reduce prep time and to surprise my players, even when I use modules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447577/#Comment_447577" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T14:30:50+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  2:30PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh... ok <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>You asked for details an explanation... so there you have it... it's going to be a big one XD<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>Well, what I did in <a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.de/2014/10/tactical-ops.html" rel="nofollow">Tactical Ops</a> and <a href="http://unplayablegames.blogspot.de/2014/12/fateless.html" rel="nofollow">FateLess</a> was trying to find out the very basic structural elements of the experience I wanted to convey (kind of deconstructing it) and put together tools that would give them to the Players.<br/><br/>Example...<br/>The <b>only</b> thing that players are allowed to describe is what the PCs present in the current scene are actively perceiving, right here and now.<br/>So, no one can say what lays behind a door unless a PC takes action to discover it in the fiction.<br/>And even then, the ONLY thing that is being described is the PC's perception... it might be flawed, incomplete, misunderstood, a trick or illusion.<br/><br/>Functionally all Players are in the same exact situation as they would if there was a GM at the table. You (almost) only know what your PC knows, and you only worry about that... the invisible GM will worry about the rest, the story, the big picture... not you... you CAN'T even if you wanted to. You are a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Player</span>.<br/><br/>Then other structures take care of introducing unexpected stuff. But instead of tables of random CONTENT, I use two tables of random SHAPES.<br/>One (Soft Opposition) only affects the fiction, while the other (Hard Opposition) has also specific mechanical effects.<br/><br/>As an example here is the Soft Opposition table from the FateLess book...\n<blockquote><br/>1) The situation gets sticky<br/>Your circumstances worsen, someone or something becomes more hostile, or appears now and is already hostile; either way it ACTS against you. It tries.<br/><br/>2) Your weakness shows<br/>One of your Aspects causes a BIG PROBLEM for some reason. Doesn\u2019t count as Compel.<br/><br/>3) Shit hits the fan<br/>Something important is broken or lost. Someone important (NPC) is apprehended or seriously wounded or dangerously separated from the PCs. Or you deplete an important resource you might need right now or in the near future (ammo, food, drugs, etc).<br/><br/>4) Something wicked this way comes<br/>You perceive or are told about something BAD that is happening, or about to happen, here or nearby or somewhere else (but is immediately relevant).<br/><br/>5) Cut Out<br/>Something happens to isolate your PC from her allies or an important resource. This does not count as a Compel.<br/><br/>6) The Ball Drops<br/>Same as \u201cThe situation gets sticky\u201d but the thing acting against you succeeds in its intent for the current action. <br/></blockquote>\nThis way you inject a random SHAPE that the players will have to fill with actual CONTENT.<br/>It has enough structure so that they Players are not feeling like they are creating a problem for themselves, it just requires that some color be applied to it to make it fit in the current fiction.<br/>Thanks to this, your random (thus unexpected and fair) element will always look and feel perfectly right, logical and "<b>realistic</b>"... just the same as when a GM springs up with something you did not expect (or expected but did not knew for sure) that is perfectly tied to what has happened so far, and all the current circumstances and details.<br/><br/>In <b>Tactical Ops</b> such a structure (and other tricks and mechanics) is leveraged to offer a <b>challenge</b> to the PCs.<br/>They will face Obstacles that have a standard level of difficulty depending on the Mission setup, and then they will have to cope with unexpected events (like in the above table) and with the specific circumstances... because most elements of the fiction can be TAGGED as mechanically relevant, and depending on how you leverage them (or not) they will add good or bad dice to your action rolls.<br/><br/>Again you have the feeling that an invisible GM has set up a very detailed scenario, that you can interact with, getting logical and realistic and consistent results depending on you ideas and choices and actions.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/><b>Of course</b> it is not 100% the same as having an actual GM at the table taking care of all such things with zero input required from the Players.<br/>But it gets <b>pretty close</b> if you ask me ;-)<br/>With a few added advantages...<br/><br/>With a real GM you need a <b>GOOD GM</b>, which means someone with your same aesthetic tastes and priorities AND a decent deal of practice and experience (and time for prep, and the will to put effort into it, each single session) ... it's a valuable commodity that is not always available, right?<br/>With Tactical Ops and FateLess, you don't need it :P<br/><br/>Also... in FullMyth you need lots of prepped setting material, and again someone that KNOWS such material and delivers it to the other Players during the game.<br/>With the right gm-less structure you can generate such material on the fly, but <b>without</b> feeling like you are answering your own questions (boring!) and <b>with</b> all the solidity and consistency and level of detail that your heart might desire.<br/><br/>It's all a matter of using a series of tricks and mechanics to cheat the Player's <b>perception</b> of the game. You ARE coming up with all the game stuff, but NOT in a "director stance" way, not in a way that makes you feel not-a-Player and too much like a part-time-GM.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>What I observed is that most Players often WANT to contribute to the description of situations and places and npcs. It happens all the time. Especially when the system encourages it, or even just makes a bit of space for such contribution.<br/>And when you DO want to contribute, it doesn't feel like you are the GM, you are just adding a cool idea to the game.<br/>The "<b>problem</b>" is that if the system asks you to offer this kind of contribution too much, too often, all at once... then yes, you feel like a GM, you start thinking in terms of story and overall picture, not from your PC's perspective.<br/>This is cool and dandy, but is not what we wanted, right?<br/><br/>What I did is use tricks to prevent (or at least minimize) this from happening.<br/>In a 2 Player game you will feel this more, obviously, as whatever I don't say then you have to say. While in a 3+ Player game you feel this exponentially less.<br/><br/>I hope this rant makes some sort of sense and is somewhat understandable &gt;_&lt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447579/#Comment_447579" name="Item_258" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T16:43:07+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  4:43PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!

I forget), your "prep" (whether it happens, improvised, on the spot, or before the game) very much <i>should</i> interact with their character concepts and choices, because that's your job: to pick up on what the players want to showcase about their characters and to develop story elements which interact with that and create interesting character choices.<br/><br/>Presenting Celia as the NPC they meet instead of a random villager is a perfect example of that. <br/><br/>How much of "deciding Celia meets them and has this [story-meaningful] ring" do you think was a problem for you because of technical agenda (you just don't like the feeling of making decisions that way, possibly because you're sick of doing that, for instance) and how much of it was a problem because it made the game less good for everyone (a creative agenda issue)?<br/><br/>I could see it going either way, depending on the game, and maybe you can't tell right now, but I think it's an interesting question to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447799/#Comment_447799" name="Item_263" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-09T19:41:38+00:00" title="August  9, 2015  7:41PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2015 7:43PM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bond is the B in BIFT a.k.a.
