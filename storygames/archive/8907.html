I love the setting, and keep hoping for some type of 3rd edition that would magickally fix all the problems that I have with it. I very much view UA as the last, best example of a more traditional RPG. It was the game that, I believe, took me as far as a traditional-style game could. I just don't think the mechanics, as is, are as integrated into the setting as they could be. There are parts that are awesome, like the brutal combat, the madness meters, the schools, and the avatars. But I just don't think that this game can simply provide good play for me, mostly as a GM. I hate statting NPCs and I think that as much as I love the broad scope of the world, it can get a little unfocused.<br/><br/>Ok, let me shut up.

It describes its system very much as task based. The good news is, it works pretty well if you want to make a one roll conflict type deal, due to the way the odds of success work. <br/><br/>Past that, 2nd edition has group campaign and character creation, relationship maps, psychologically driven play, a basic flag system, and even some stuff about scene framing. <br/><br/>So yea, it looks like a trad game, it task resolves like a trad game, and many people do play it as a trad game (especially by making the players ignorant of whats happening the world) -- but many parts of it are close to story games already. Just make sure the players know the basics of what's going on, follow the group creation rules and adventure creation rules, and zoom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196885/#Comment_196885" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T16:11:58+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  4:11PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>How would you do Unknown Armies?</blockquote>\nWhat I've done:<br/><br/>(a) What Judd said, plus<br/><br/>(b) Adding a bit more at character creation, with a questionaire to focus play.  Last time I did, for an Otherspace one-shot scenario with pre-gens, I asked:<br/><br/>* If this character was in a movie, who would he or she be played by?<br/>* [List of three trouble situation]  Pick at least one trouble you're in that sound like fun to play.<br/>* You know a guy named Steve.  Mid 40's, white, dresses well.  How do you know him?<br/>* You know a woman named Lydia.  Early 20's, white, often wears simple dresses.  How do you know her?<br/><br/>And that went pretty well.
