The big end, was putting out a small fire.  So, now my remembering self, as I recall the game, isn\u2019t super jazzed about it.  It was fun play, but my remembering self wouldn\u2019t say it was super-fun, happy play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, had I paced the threats better, give a good big bad a larger threat, then the end would have happened more dramatically.  And that type of intense ending would have a better chance of impressing my future remembering self.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
