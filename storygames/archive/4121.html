At the moment the playtesting is quite odd as I am trying to put the game together while we are playing, so we are just trying some of my ideas to see what works. We seem to be getting there though.<br/><br/>Since last time I have thrown a lot of stuff out. A hero is now defined by:<br/><br/>Background: Jobs, relationships etc.<br/>Resources: Guns, allies etc.<br/>Damage: How much of a beating he has taken.<br/><br/>I wont talk about damage much as we didn't get that far, but we did start off a story and invented something new. Also the nemesis is now played by one of the players and is not just mechanical. As it stood at the start of the session you get take a development scene to get something new, where you give the nemesis some threat. You can also take an action scene where you stake something, like a resource or background, on the action. you will always get your stake, but the nemesis may get 0 to some threat depending on how succesful your action is.<br/><br/>The immediate problem shevy ran into was that at one point she wanted to merely uncover some plot and wondered if she could stake that on the action scene she was about to do. It seemed reasonable and so we though about how we could implement that in the game. We came up with the 'Plot Fish'. <br/><br/>The 'Plot Fish' is a line on a piece of paper running from beginning to end. Off of this are lines that contain important plot elements, in this case a mysterious amulet, and how it is integrated into the plot, in this case stolen by thieves. At the time we couldn't decide what a win or loss meant specifically in this kind of scene and so we made something up at the time that was satisfactory.<br/><br/>Since that session I have been rewriting the game and think I now know how these 'plot scenes' work:<br/><br/>1) They must contain action<br/>2) A plot scene is basically the heroes trying to uncover the nemesis' plot before he gets to achieve it.<br/>3) With that in mind a win means the players uncover some plot and get a bonus of some sort towards defeating the nemesis.<br/>4) If they lose they still uncover the plot, but it is too late to stop that particular element coming to fruition and the nemesis gains some threat to continue his plans.<br/><br/>How does that sound? I think this plot fish thing, will give the game the focus it needs and also make the game run quicker which I was looking for. Once I have drawn a plot fish in powerpoint i will post it up, and rename it!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
