It was an abundance of riches, but they turned out to be two great games.  Thought I'd share the joy:<br/> <br/>MOUSE GUARD:<br/> <br/>I was invited to playtest Mouse Guard with three folks I've never met before.  M's first time GMing it, S and A's first time playing, my 2nd.  I've run a few times, so I've read the sample adventures and characters in the back of the book.<br/> <br/>M let us pick from the pregen characters, but when it came time to pick a mission, he said he'd been mulling over an original mission of his own.  Hooray!  Dain, Quentin, and Baron set out from Lockhaven to see why Appleloft hadn't sent a report with the spring thaw.  M really had a good handle on how MG is structured. He took us through writing some fresh goals, and we were off.  <br/> <br/>Overall, the mission went a little too smoothly at first.  Other than an intial taste of failure, we were rolling like rockstars.  We got through a wilderness obstacle no problem, built ourselves a bridge in record time, and started to dig Appleloft out of a snowbank.  We finally had a failure there, so we got an Animals twist that led to a conflict with a bluejay.  We won a narrow victory, and nobody spent their persona point.<br/> <br/>The players' turn saw us explore Appleloft, recover some conditions, fail to recover others, and try to help the citizens fix up their granary.  Then we played out the rewards, which was...rewarding.<br/> <br/>The only time things slowed was when M paused to teach a new mechanic.  Typical first-time stuff.  Despite a dearth of failure and twists in the midsection, M ran a great game.  Excellent grasp of the mechanics, good improv.  S and A really picked up the game fast, too.  This was the first MG game I've played where everyone had a copy of the book!   <br/> <br/> <br/>ZOMBIE PLAYGROUND RPG:<br/> <br/>"I told you I'd shoot, but you didn't believe me.  Why didn't you believe me?"<br/> <br/> <a href="http://www.jasonchanart.com/gallery/2008/zombieplayground.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.jasonchanart.com/gallery/2008/zombieplayground.jpg</a><br/> <br/>I've wanted to make a game out of that image ever since I saw it, and here it is:<br/> <br/><a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0Bwb-QLMPhQbWMjhmOTM5NGQtODY2Zi00M2ZlLWI2ZjctZWUzZmUxNmQ2YmI4&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0Bwb-QLMPhQbWMjhmOTM5NGQtODY2Zi00M2ZlLWI2ZjctZWUzZmUxNmQ2YmI4&amp;hl=en</a><br/> <br/>So later that same night, I had two other people over (friends D and R, from my regular gaming group) to playtest this monstrosity.<br/> <br/>D came up with Petey Henderson, the tough 6th grader with the smoking habit and a girlfriend.  R had Harold the nerdy kid who did homework for hire.  D played in my Monsters campaign a couple years back, so he had a good handle on the One-Roll Engine.  R was a total noob to the ORE, but 10 minutes of explanation had him up to speed on dice pools, Relationships, and rolling matches.<br/> <br/>We did a warmup scene at recess, where R jumped in with both feet, trying to persuade Petey to help Harold with a bully.  We got to work a little on dice rolling, the difference between Width and Height, and emotional Shock damage.<br/> <br/>The next scene saw the intro of the Zombies with the takedown of an innocent teacher.  A couple of hours of sustained mayhem later, the ground was littered with zombies, Harold's girlfriend had succumbed to the plague, and Petey had twigged to the fact that the zombies tracked by sound and were sensitive to loud noises.  An extended climax ensued, in which two smart and one splattery zombie ran interference while, Petey, Harold, and the janitor tried to set off every alarm and noise maker they could find.<br/> <br/>Highlights:<br/> <br/>R, who'd never played Monsters before, jumps right in, rolls dice, and takes risks.<br/> <br/>All the mechanics got used.  The players earned and spent Background Tokens freely.  I got to infect and zombiefy several NPC's.<br/> <br/>Improv elements ran pretty smoothly.  The system is loose enough that everyone could be creative without the rules getting in the way.<br/> <br/>The ORE, when interpreted loosely, makes kick-ass crazy action scenes.<br/> <br/>Zombie stats seemed just about right.  A stiff challenge for one kid, not too horrible for a armed kid or a team, damn tough in large mobs.<br/> <br/>Needs work:<br/> <br/>The value of Insight wasn't readily obvious.  Players spent way more Tokens as xp than on Insights.<br/> <br/>Zombie Menace didn't build in a way that cranked the tension.  Might need to go to one die per finished scene...<br/> <br/>My scene framing was weak, which hampered the Relationship-adjusting mechanic.<br/> <br/>The nothing-to-lose element of a one-shot leads to players tossing relationship dice into every roll.  These kids came out very Action Hero by the end.<br/> <br/>Need to steal some mook mechanics from Reign or something.  Bookkeeping for a 5-zombie mob was a bit of a pain, and zombie herds get in each others' way more than they should.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
