It's more William Morris's <i>Well at the World's End</i> than <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, but I had in mind also Marie de France, the <i>Faerie Queene</i> and more modern treatments like Tamora Pierce's. (I have to say I dislike both <i>The Once and Future King</i> and <i>The Wizard Knight</i>, mainly because of the modern/postmodern feel to them; I like my medievalism to be more medieval.)<br/><br/>The Errantry setting is much more Arthurian or Breton than Celtic or Norse, but you could move it in those directions easily enough by giving more emphasis to the faerie side of things for Celtic or adding some more monstrous monsters for Norse, and of course emphasizing tragic doomed heroism.<br/><br/>It has a "magic dial" which you can set high, medium or low - low is basically your standard medieval knightly tale, medium is Marie de France or William Morris and high is Tamora Pierce, roughly. <br/><br/>Adventures typically consist of episodic encounters with opponents and helpers in the course of a quest.<br/><br/>Foes are Black Knights, enchanters/enchantresses, beasts both speaking and non-speaking, natural and heraldic.<br/><br/>And characters are Knights, Ladies (quite a powerful character class), Ecclesiastics, Enchanters, Troubadours and Speaking Beasts, or combinations thereof.<br/><br/>It's unfinished and unplaytested (though most of it is standard Solar System, so it should play fine), but you might get some inspiration from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150325/#Comment_150325" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T00:47:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take a look at <i>Errantry</i>, Mike.

Hope I'm not too late, here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you say pre-tolkien, I'm guessing you mean Arthurian (as the Hobbit came out in 1936 and T. H. White brought out the "Once and Future King" in the 50s.)<br/>\nSo, we're looking at the works like the French Romances, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, in that case, you could look to Robin Hood, Orlando Furioso, Lord Dunsany and the Songs of Charlemaine, too, perhaps?<br/>\nWe're talking secret meetings in the Greenwood, maybe? Fantastic Isles and feats of passion and faith? Some combination of these?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe using the works of Howard Pyle as inspiration might work? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could try capturing that feel of singular moments that define the path of a character up until a certain legend blooms, followed by the final passing of that character.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, for instance, you could have everyone create a legend, first, and then work out, one by one, the vignettes or sub-scenes of how those legends met, how they fell in love, how they triumphed, how they almost fell to their greatest foes and how they died.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you could use a simple index system, where everyone has to fulfill a certain number of these scenes and they must aid others in completing that other players' respective scenes in order to earn chits or dice or cards or some other resource to "glorify" or add significance to their own.

White because although he was writing after/contemporaneously with Tolkien, as with Gene Wolfe he was drawing his influences from people like George MacDonald and Thomas Malory (which is to say, pre-Tolkien influences).\n<blockquote><br/>So, we're looking at the works like the French Romances, right?<br/><br/>Well, in that case, you could look to Robin Hood, Orlando Furioso, Lord Dunsany and the Songs of Charlemaine, too, perhaps?<br/>We're talking secret meetings in the Greenwood, maybe?

Are there any works in particular to recommend? Basically yes - French and Middle English Romances are one of the main inspirations. \n<blockquote><br/>You could try capturing that feel of singular moments that define the path of a character up until a certain legend blooms, followed by the final passing of that character.<br/><br/>Like, for instance, you could have everyone create a legend, first, and then work out, one by one, the vignettes or sub-scenes of how those legends met, how they fell in love, how they triumphed, how they almost fell to their greatest foes and how they died.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could use a simple index system, where everyone has to fulfill a certain number of these scenes and they must aid others in completing that other players' respective scenes in order to earn chits or dice or cards or some other resource to "glorify" or add significance to their own.

I'd rather play through a sequence of 'adventures' and have the legend develop retrospectively - allowing players to embellish their own accomplishments and experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152617/#Comment_152617" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T01:32:49+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  1:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you could do a campaign where each player picks one major triumph from the life of their legend that they want to play out, knowing that this major scene will shape the eventual demise of that legend sometime in the undefined future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, as each other player enters the game (on their early or first turns) you could play out vignettes from their past that "ready" or "boost up" certain powers or traits that the players think will be useful in the major event. This kind of jumping back and forth in time and listing attributes was common in the old courtly lays, as I recall... rather dimly, actually. No, that's definitely part of the structure of the Maid Marian poems, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, once everyone's introduced, you could start throwing out the choices the legend has to make in order to accomplish this major triumph. These should start piling up factors that will lead to the legend's eventual demise (creating dire enemies, revealing weaknesses, making vows, being cruelly betrayed or set up for it, that kind of thing.) I don't know if you'd want to handle that with cards or dice or player suggestions, but it's part of the structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main character for the game must have a solid reason to be striving for this major victory and the other players should get some benefits, like increases to their own legends' powers and glory, for introducing tough choices. You'll also need some sort of delimiter or fly wheel mechanic to keep the other players from adding too many tough choices to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and Howard Pyle was an American children's illustrator, sorry.
