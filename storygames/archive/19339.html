I didn't expect this to be a problem, as they had contacts and money for bribes, as well as the skills to steal a vehicle. Really, no big.<br/><br/>Martin: Everyone! Let me work!<br/><br/>Lillian: Thank Kali for competent pimps.<br/><br/>Okay, I figured we were going for "My friend here will have sex with you if you'll give us all a lift to Point B." Not the approach I expected, but perfectly viable. Martin spoke the local language, so he'd be doing the talking. If the captain preferred guys, well, so did Martin, so he could improvise, and anyway, it was getting late, and Point B was where a Core Clue was, so I wasn't about to add extra complications this time.<br/><br/>As it turned out, I didn't have to. Martin's player cheerfully did it. What I expected to be a simple, straightforward sex-for-transportation deal turned into --<br/><br/>Martin: So, my friend here read a silly desert romance novel and wants a fine Italian captain to pretend he's kidnapping her and have sex with her and then drive her to an infantry column so it can pretend to rescue her because her uncle here is going to send her to school when he gets back -- no, it's fine, her uncle is totally behind this plan because he also wants her to have some fun.<br/><br/>Once Vito, pretending to be Lillian's uncle (and who also spoke Italian) finished mentally facepalming, he explained that she had a thing for one of those, er, jazz musician types, and he'd rather her first time was with a fine Italian man who knew how to treat her.
