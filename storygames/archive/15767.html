He wrote the original version for Game Chef 2010, so I joined the crowdfunding campaign because the concept was cool and I like being supportive of Game Chef alumns.<br/><br/>Holy crap this game is beautiful as a product.  It's two shrink-wrapped decks of cards, a laminated instruction booklet, and a folded two-sided playmat (with the reverse side showing an example of play) and it comes in a tuckbox that's almost as nice as the ones Fantasy Flight uses for Red November and the like.  I've been really excited about RPG-inspired games being delivered as products other than books and this game definitely builds on a few other exciting developments out there, such as Freemarket, the Mouse Guard boxed set, and Warhammer 3rd.<br/><br/>Haven't gotten a chance to really read through or play it yet but, man, Sebastian has already done so many things right with the product design and presentation.  I look forward to digging in more and coming back with more thoughts.<br/><br/>Sebastian, how expensive was this to produce and who was your printer?  I'm stunned by how many quality materials you were able to include here.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that -- because the box is slightly too big for the included materials -- it got slightly crushed during shipping when it was presumably stacked with heavier stuff and was compressed.  I popped it back into place and the damage isn't really noticeable, though.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357790/#Comment_357790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T14:51:25+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  2:51PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Same to you Joey and Rafu. I see what you mean about the box being too large for their components. It's something that you don't notice when you look at the decks straight out of the shipping boxes. But now that you've mentioned it, they are a little too big for their contents. Just a little, little, but little enough to cause some compression issues during transit. Bummer.\n<blockquote>Sebastian, how expensive was this to produce and who was your printer?</blockquote>\nIncluding shipping (to me) and tax, it was around $4 per pack. I used a printer called PrintMasterIndia. Overall, I was very happy with the product but it seems that around 5% of the delivery include dodgy misprints (of colour, alignment or page order). That was a disappointment, but, with time and diligence, we are going through all 1244 decks to look for errors. I'll squeeze them out like dirty, pustulous blackheads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357862/#Comment_357862" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T08:59:17+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  8:59AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2012 9:00AM by Sebastian.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, thanks for your feedback.
