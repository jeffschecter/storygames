So they either care about each other, or they care about NPCs that travel with them, or they're just the sort of passionate fuckers who DO grow attached real quick to every poor soul with a sob story in every town in the land/system/galaxy.<br/><br/>In the case of the first, the relationships need to be problematic enough that it creates genuine friction and hard choices. You need a Mal and Amara, a Simon and Jayne. That's mostly up to the players, but AW supports it quite well. Same with Solar System, with appropriately primed Keys.<br/><br/>In the case of the second, AW is fine for that as long as the PC builds come primed with NPCs--crew for the Operator or Savvyhead, Gang members, Cultists, and so on. Again, the players have to bake them into the setup. These are great because not only will they have their own issues and problems for the PCs to deal with, they'll get entangled with the locals whether the PCs do or not.<br/><br/>In the case of the third...well, awesome! But not every group will, by default. And if you're working with the kind of players who characterize Firefly as "cool fights, smart arse quips," I wouldn't hold my breath for this unless your setup bakes it in.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334972/#Comment_334972" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T20:40:14+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  8:40PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2011 8:41PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: epweissengruber</cite>3) Apocalypse World: the character archetypes are a good match -- but rewriting a bunch of playbooks and the MC moves seems a big task.</blockquote>\nI think you might be overestimating how much rewriting would be required. Especially given that most of the playbooks as-written-and-conceived by Vincent are acknowledged to be directly based on the cast of Firefly. What sort of rewriting did you have in mind?<br/><br/>Either way you'll definitely still want to keep Joel's advice in mind. An Operator would presumably be a must, with an obligation gig (or two) involving the ship and crew, and a whole lot of 'Make them pay' moves on the part of the MC.

I think that you could use a different set of names and some of the minor colour stuff could change a little then run it just the way it is. <br/><br/>The spaceship doesn't need stats unless someone's a driver and then cross out car and write "SPACESHIP" mutatis mutantis. <br/><br/>I don't even think it matters all that much what play books are taken because the fiction says space but it's really the desert with a twist. <br/><br/>Sometimes the spaceship is a house, a helicopter, a train, a boat, a plane and an automobile. Mostly, it's a boat.
