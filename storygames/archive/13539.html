The popularity of AA far outstrips the original NDS platform here--I've played on PC emulator and on my phone, but never owned an NDS in my life. I love the series and have been thinking for a while now how to bring that nifty courtroom/mystery drama to roleplaying. The lawyer part of me knows the court system is ridiculous and in real life the very idea of a three-day criminal trial makes me queasy, but as a game consumer I don't care because the story and the relationships are so interesting. I'd like to try and recreate that at the table. Maybe in the process I could iron out some of the sillier parts of the AA legal system, while keeping the courtroom/mystery aesthetic that makes the original series great.<br/><br/>The design challenge is that none of this will require gamemaster preparation. If all this came from a GM's ability to plot a kick-ass story, that's just peachy for the GM and her players, but doesn't do much for people with little time and/or training. It will also cease to be a fun pickup game, like how you could pick up the NDS (or a cell phone) to play Ace Attorney. In fact, I don't want Objection! The RPG (working title) to have a GM at all.<br/><br/>Right now I'm thinking of a four-person distributed-authority system like Polaris. One player will be the Attorney, the player across from the Attorney will be the Prosecution, the player to the left of the Attorney is the Assistant (or Sidekick?), and to the right is the Authority. The Attorney plays the defense attorney, the Assistant is the sidekick (including any sexy spirit mentors) and witnesses for the defense, the Prosecution is, well, the prosecution and witnesses for the prosecution, and the Authority plays the judge, law enforcement, and maybe the jury if the players are into an Anglo-American jury trial. (Although a jury is more likely to be color than anything else, for the simple reason that they don't speak during the proceedings. On the other hand, an alternate game could take place mostly within the jury chamber like that episode of The Good Wife, with the trial scenes coming in flashbacks while different jurors fight over how to read the evidence. I kind of like that idea, maybe it could be an expansion pack.) I don't know what to do with the Defendant (or Accused) and Victim, but I think they could be kicked around like footballs depending on the flow of the game. Fighting for control of the Defendant or the Victim chip could be fun, and make for a more board-game feel.<br/><br/>I'm still a fuzzy on how the actual, you know, game will run. I have vague ideas of following the original series structure for now (like I said, shameless rip-off), with the play running from Introduction (what was the crime?) -&gt; Investigation Phase 1 -&gt; Trial Phase 1 (no pre-trial hearing, no bail... must... not... complicate...) -&gt; (Investigation -&gt; Trial Phases 2 and maybe 3) -&gt; Denouement.<br/><br/>I think Fiasco would be a good model to set up the crime, the reveal, and other elements. That would be dice pool -&gt; use up dice to choose elements from a chart -&gt; play. The Fiasco model of setup is particularly good because it doesn't give the whole truth of the situation, just bits and pieces. Everyone will have a different idea of how the pieces fit together, but unlike Fiasco, the point is to bring the opposed interpretations into direct conflict.<br/><br/>The Investigation and Trial scenes will play out largely as a negotiated narration between the Attorney and the Prosecution, with the Assistant helping/inadvertently hindering the Attorney and the Authority serving as arbiter. (Yes, there are more people on the side of the defense than the prosecution, which I think is okay because stacking the deck against the state is the point of modern criminal trials.). An important ritual word, of course, will be "Objection!" which will be how the Attorney interjects contradictions into the testimony. And yes, for any fellow AA fans out there, the finger-pointing gesture is mandatory, like the handshake in Beast Hunters. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(My inner lawyer and gaming fan are fighting each other on this one. I can't imagine shouting "Objection!" at a <i>witness,</i> but it is such a big part of the original experience. Same goes for the huge back-and-forths that the defense and district attorneys (usually Wright [Naruhodo] and Edgeworth [Mitsurugi]) get into, where they are essentially testifying on substance outside of opening and closing statements. Maybe the negotiated narration can sublimate this process a bit so that lawyers and law buffs can pretend that the fight is about procedural propriety and rules of evidence, not the substance of the testimony. Or maybe I'll just frak it all since the in-game legal system is imaginary anyway, then kill my inner lawyer and take her stuff.)<br/><br/>Other thoughts: Character generation is probably best done cooperatively, with intentional contrasts and maybe some history between the defense attorney and the prosecutor. (Shades of Shooting the Moon?) Different stages of the game will have different gaming (and dramatic) elements, maybe with the Attorney and Prosecution taking turns to insert twists and turns, perhaps by using up a dice pool.<br/><br/>Thoughts?
