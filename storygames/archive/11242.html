They're right there, after all.  Even if they're not speaking, they have an impact on the conduct of the game because they have the potential to open their mouths and interrupt the stream of whatever else is going on.  This is not the case in IRC.  While there's a list of people in a channel, they aren't really <i>present</i> in a real sense unless they're broadcasting text.  If they're silent, they might as well have vanished from the virtual table.  Consequently the person currently roleplaying has virtually unlimited space to dominate the game.<br/><br/>My question is how to get around this.  Obviously not everyone has something to say/do in every scene, but how do we ensure that the conch gets passed regularly and fairly such that everyone at least gets a <i>chance</i> to guide the action?  Does it have to be so structured as setting limits on who can speak and for how long, or have some of you out there come up with more informal methods of achieving this goal?<br/><br/>I won't say our game is <i>crippled</i> by this lack of discipline, but it has been noted that some players are sort of fading into the background to the point where they cease to have meaningful impact on the game.  That's not good any way you look at it, so a solution is clearly necessary.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249643/#Comment_249643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T06:11:37+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  6:11AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 6:13AM by Potemkin.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found having two rooms open, one for all serious game business (in-character roleplay, GM stuff, dice-rolling) and another for conversation (comedic asides, mechanics disputes and general chatting) helps players who might otherwise feel that they can't speak at <i>this</i> particular moment from fading into the background. It also means you don't loose your place in the narrative should something huge come up. <br/><br/>Having private rooms for each player to the DM (if the chat doesn't have whispering) can also be a valuable tool for note-swapping, prompts or quiet disciplining. <br/><br/>This way a game can be seen to run flawlessly whereas, in actual fact, all the non-essential asides are stored away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249644/#Comment_249644" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T06:17:56+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  6:17AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, get an Off Topic-channel like Potemkin suggests. That way inactive players can still DO something, like make commentary on the action in the game channel, plan out future scenes or whatever.<br/><br/>Second, Panty Explosion and Polaris both do something interesting; they hand out narrative responsibility to otherwise inactive players. In PE OTHER players narrate the outcomes of dice rolls for YOUR character. And in Polaris the other players play the NPCs in your scenes.  Can you do something similar in your game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249804/#Comment_249804" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T05:08:43+00:00" title="January  6, 2010  5:08AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wilhelm, I'm not sure that <i>Apocalypse World</i> will accommodate that sort of thing with the way it defines the MC's role.

Instead, I do scenes with the people who are there for it, and post the logs of those games on a blog thingy so other people can peruse them when they feel like it. Of course, there are sometimes superflous observer people, but since I do scenes and not sessions, they can generally feel pretty confident that their turn, a time when I focus on them and them only, will come, too.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, and as you've probably noticed... When it's not my character's scene, I do OOC chatter - suggest NPC names when the MC asks about them, go ( !!! ) when something cool happens, and comment and/or make fun of the actions of other PCs as they do them. IRC or not, it's difficult to forget you exist if you're excited enough about what other people are doing (and show it through endless messages).</p>\n<p>I haven't played enough at-the-table games to know for sure, but I'm fairly certain that the problem you mentioned here - someone being essentially ignored - exist in that medium, too. When interesting things happen, and a guy sits there quietly and does nothing, it's as easy to forget about him as on chat. And if the the GM/MC does notice, it's because he made a point to do so. Going "hey, that guy hasn't done anything yet... Lets see what he does!" works well enough with both faces and IRC nicks on the sidebar, I think.</p>\n<p>The obvious sure-fire cure to this is playing a game that makes each player's involvement essential - so much that you literally cannot play without them weighing in every once in a while. GMless cooperative games of all stripes and colours should do this well enough...</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249894/#Comment_249894" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T23:31:40+00:00" title="January  6, 2010 11:31PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AFAIK this is a problem identified in CSCL / CSCW (computer-supported collaborative learning / work), too. Instant messenger apps have tried to solve this kinds of problems with status icons. Also, this is an issue that most online games have. In our OpenRpg and Vassal games about one third of the chatter is used for notifications like "I'm gonna grab a drink, just a moment" etc. But I think the games are better because we actively communicate those kinds of things so that everybody knows who's around.<br/><br/>In the learning context it can be argued that those not actively participating in the discussion can still be engaged in an active learning process. The problem is that the tutor (for example, following and moderating a discussion or debate on an irc channel) cannot see if that is the case and if the process facilitates any learning. In the CSCL field, some solutions for this have been technological (the IM example above) and some social. In my opinion the most promising and realistic ones are in the form of guidance to the tutor: try to engage everyone (directed questions), use a structure that demands input from each one from time to time etc. <br/><br/>To set this in context: I think that, as in the learning context, it is probably not certain that active participation == fun in irc rpgs. Some passive by-standers might be having fun too, but it is hard to know. And the level of engagement will probably vary from person to person and from time to time (as in CSCL). <br/><br/>Because of that I think that enforcing rigid meta-mechanical limits or requirements of contribution would not be the best answer. In fact, they could clash with the system of the game you are playing (I'm not sure as I'm not familiar with Apocalypse World). My solution would be for the facilitator to ensure, with straight questions and prompts to contribute if needed, that all the players present feel that they can participate actively if they like. But the baseline would be to know who is around and who's not (is using /away commands not an option?). Not to forget discussing about these problems if the need arises. So all in all a meta channel seems to be a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
