Rather, they were the underlying issues that led to the reviewers providing that feedback.<br/><br/><br/>When writing my game, I was sure that people would ask for a an endgame mechanic.  I considered adding one and deliberately rejected it as unnecessary.  Some mechanically constructed way to   And sure, enough, four of my reviews asked for an endgame mechanic.  I've run and played and designed enough similar games with various groups to know that such a mechanic wouldn't be needed.  The hypercharged situation constructed at the start of play would naturally sort itself out into a stabilized equilibrium without any external pacing mechanic.    I've also designed other similar games where a mechanical endgame system caused problems as the story resolved itself separate from the pacing mechanic.  I playtested this Game Chef game without any endgame mechanic, and everything worked fine (as I predicted).  The situation clearly reached its own ending without being told to by the system.  <br/><br/>Endgame mechanics are great for other games, just not necessary for this one.  And several reviews gave other good advice beyond the request for endgame mechanics.  (I don't mean to belittle the reviewers or their contribution.  Their feedback was very useful to me.)<br/><br/>But what I took away from this was not that I should add in an endgame mechanic.  What I should do (if I work further on the game, which is unlikely) is make it clear that the situation will resolve itself.  Maybe provide advice or tools to see when the game is gliding into a natural stopping point on its own power and how to wrap things up.  The GC feedback was useful because I now saw that the game didn't present itself very well in text.  The broad structure of play was never really presented to the reader, and that led to specific kinds of feedback.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416605/#Comment_416605" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T16:12:06+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  4:12PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I learned that I can't rely on players to discover neat things about a game, I have to sell players on them.  <br/></blockquote>\nYou mean when they play it?

It's like a microwave, the fun is in putting in different things in, turning it on, and seeing what happens.  It's also got a specific theme, which I didn't spell out explicitly.  The problem, I think, is that I didn't actually say, "Hey, these are the parts that are neat, look at all the different ways things could go!"  Just reading it, it's not obvious what's to like - Like a microwave, if you don't put anything inside then it just looks like cabinet with a light.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416617/#Comment_416617" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T20:30:54+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  8:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see so it's not that people couldn't find anything fun in play, it was that by just reading it alone people would have a hard time telling what play is like.

I've completed Game Chef every year since 2006, and this is one of three that I'd actually play. The others are my first, which I playtested and played and have enjoyed playing. And I'd love to play last year's if I could find people interested in setting up a shadow puppet stage and engaging in a parlor game. I think if I do Game Chef again, the most important thing for me is making a game that I really want to play. I learned that on this round.<br/><br/>I also learned that I like game design contests better with lower word counts. It makes reviewing easier and I think it forces the designers to cut the wordy words, which just leaves the best parts in the game. 1,500 feels about right to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/artexercise" title="artexercise"><img alt="artexercise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://artexercise.mygamesonline.org/graphics/Dragon_Icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/artexercise">artexercise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416632/#Comment_416632" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T04:59:57+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  4:59AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I learned that highlighting an aspect/mechanic of a larger game I want to design/play as a small game using just that mechanic, I can get valuable feedback about that aspect.  I learned that even as a small game I want to design something that is fun for me to think about and play, which I did, but I was tempted to go in another direction which I kind of started to see in other people's initial thoughts.<br/><br/>I also learned that people don't think they are spontaneous and quick witted, so a game that encourages that might not be picked up as readily, even though I see success with other types of games that do just that.

I'd have used less of them.<br/><br/>And having your game look too much alike an existing fun game makes it unpopular; though I was aiming at making it good and different, not <i>better than Paranoia</i> :P anyway, next year I'll try to make something less done before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416682/#Comment_416682" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T21:56:01+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  9:56PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2013 10:00PM by zircher.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're going to playtest, secure gamers before the last day when you're done.
