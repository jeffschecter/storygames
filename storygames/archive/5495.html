I finally got a chance to play it last night!  This is more of a review than an actual play report, but whatever.<br/><br/>So Classroom Deathmatch is beautiful - it's got a great cover that tells you everything you need to know and it is well laid out and stuffed with Jake's art.  In play the game was really fun, although we had to make it our own to find the fun (more on that in a minute).  First the tough love.  <br/><br/>Atarashi guys, I have a bone to pick with you - I'm all about DIY, and I'm the last guy on earth who would tell you what to do with your game.  Except I'm going to - what's up with the total lack of editing?  You've got this sexy, professional-looking package, and it was a total bait-and-switch when I started reading the actual content, which is not sexy or professional.  Literally every page has errors that a machine spell check would have caught.  Even this isn't a deal-breaker, because hey, it's your thing, right?  But when we discover, in play, that a number's been dropped from the only table in the game, that's a problem (It's 88, as I recall).  <br/><br/>I mentioned that we had to make it our own.  Some points to this end:<br/><br/>The game is predicated on the rapid destruction of a classroom full of Japanese high school students.  Our churn was about ten characters per day (a day loosely defined as two or three times around the table, one scene per person, so 10 characters in 15 short scenes).  They were dropping like flies!  The game explicitly encourages this.  There are no narrative limits on the person describing success or failure, so characters are like popcorn to be chewed up with glee.  It's actually really fun, and the game comes with a classroom all set to go.  However, all this churn is coupled with sub-systems that hinge on defining relationships at the table.  So I grab a new character and I'm supposed to define a Friend and a Rival from the characters currently in play, the players of whom will narrate my successes and failures.  We dumped this almost immediately for "person on right narrates success, left narrates failure."<br/><br/>The way the die pool is structured more or less guarantees success.  We had two failures the entire game.  Characters lives are so short that there's no tactical incentive not to use all their resources as quickly as possible.  Many mornings (character dice pools partially refresh at dawn) saw players with brand new characters who did not need refreshment.  There was no pressure to implement flashbacks to gain more dice, and nobody bothered.  There's no solid advice on what constitutes a round of action, or a day in game terms.  The GM earns "Sorrow dice", which I was excited about but never needed, having a bottomless stack of NPCs to provide adversity.  This all really felt like a game that had not been playtested very much, because they are fairly obvious problems.<br/><br/>So where was the fun?  The fun is large, despite all these problems.  You've got a classroom full of 50 students with individual ID cards and stats ready to go (two spelling errors on every card - we thought it might be an Engrish joke, not sure).  These students have hilarious special techniques like "alligator jaw style" and "best speech ever" that can be invoked for bonus dice, and they have built in relationships to other students (who are usually dead).  You randomly assign every student a weapon, and the list is really funny.  Characters gain prominence in the story - we had a popular girl//rock star who assembled an army of adoring fanboys to keep her safe (she was ambushed and stabbed with an umbrella) and a creepy goth girl who had a nailgun and a "strangling wire" who stalked the zones.  We had a band of pacifist girls set up a medical aid station, and a lunatic who went apeshit with a katana.  There's a boy gang and a girl gang, and a class president, and stories just tended to emerge.  Popularity has a mechanical effect on play.  This stuff was all fun as hell, and after we'd sort of hand-waved the worst mechanical problems and ran with it, we had a wonderful time.  We all want to play again, actually, designing our own class and our own weapons and, to a degree, our own rules.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123446/#Comment_123446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T12:37:26+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 12:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a fantastic piece of luck to see the katana show up in the final scenes, as I had just drawn the popular kendo champion, and a bamboo sword just wasn't going to do the job with those pacifist girls...<br/><br/>Which reminds me of a suggestion for the Atarashi gang- a great product opportunity would be a handsome set of cards with weapons and equipment printed on them.  Weapons are one of the most fun parts of the game, and although I like a good random table as much as the next guy, being able to have something physical to draw out of a hat and collect from your victims would be even better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123453/#Comment_123453" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T12:49:33+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 12:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we play again, we're totally setting up a bulletin board so we can post the dead students ID cards with big red X's through them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123483/#Comment_123483" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T14:11:47+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  2:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting report - I'm planning on playing CD, once we wrap up our Hellblazer-inspired The Shadow of Yesterday-campaign, which has only two sessions left ... and there is a highschool teacher in our group, so at least one of us is going to have fun ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few questions to your review:<br/>\nDid you play a whole game in one session?<br/>\nWhy exactly did you drop the Best Friend/Rival-thing?

It was getting late and I actually removed about 8 students fromthe "available" pile at the end.<br/><br/>We dropped Best Friend/Rival because it was difficult to keep up with in play - a character might last for 3.5 minutes, and then you'd have to re-assign, and remember who was who at the table.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are cool, and I think if you played at a more stately pace they would be fun to explore.  Since we had one evening and things were pretty cut-throat (meaning character lifespan was measured in minutes) the mechanical reward was meaningless.  I agree that the <i>story </i>reward could be very satisfying, but probably only in a slower-paced game.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Morten Greis</cite><br/>If I read your review right, then characters are killed off all too early compared to their resources, so you don't need any mechanics to get new resources.

I think it could be engineered to work just fine.  I should hasten to add that it's entirely possible that we did not interpret all the rules correctly, and some sections were pretty vague.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123535/#Comment_123535" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T17:21:26+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  5:21PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2008 5:21PM by jake richmond.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting Jason.
