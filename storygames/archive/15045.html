The purpose of the game nights is to play games that most of the gamers in my area don't get a chance to play.<br/><br/>We're starting with Fiasco. Mostly because I'm addicted to it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The problem, though, is this: I may end up with up to nine or ten people coming over and there's the distinct possibility that none of them have played Fiasco before. I'm not sure what to do about that. I've considered the idea of not playing myself, but splitting them into two groups and then leaping back and forth to try to facilitate both. I've also thought about facilitating one group and shoving the book at a volunteer in the other group and hoping they'll be able to figure it out, but I don't know if that'll work. I've considered saying to heck with it and running a 10-man game of InSpectres, but I'd really prefer it if we did Fiasco because that's what folks will be expecting (besides, InSpectres is coming up on the list shortly anyway).<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Ideas? Evil schemes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341901/#Comment_341901" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T21:41:27+00:00" title="September  7, 2011  9:41PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are that addicted to it, I'm guessing you would enjoy splitting them up and hopping in-between groups to help move things along. I'm not sure I would shove a book in someone's face just so you can "play". And I mean that in the nicest possible way:)<br/><br/>But as far as evil schemes go, print out a few playsets (not too many...or else they will spend forever reading them all) and let folks create their own groups.<br/><br/>If they want to use the same playset, that's cool. Pause the groups at the halfway point and have each table exchange a piece of content with the other table. Just something cool (and new) for them to incorporate into their second half. I did this with the Dallas 1963 playset recently and it was fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341902/#Comment_341902" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T21:59:19+00:00" title="September  7, 2011  9:59PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite><br/>But as far as evil schemes go, print out a few playsets (not too many...or else they will spend forever reading them all) and let folks create their own groups.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nEvery time I've facilitated Fiasco -- a bunch of times -- I've never had this problem.

At least, it's been my experience that people don't read through the entire playset but like to give it a quick skim so they know what they're dealing with.

But you might consider not bring a large variety of playsets. I'm imagining ten people all looking through 5 copies each of 8 different playsets. And that sounds like a mess to me. I have found that groups dealing with too many *different* playsets can get analysis paralysis trying to figure out which one they want to play, and then having to come to agreement with others. <br/> <br/>But it sounds like Den's experience might be different than mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341916/#Comment_341916" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T00:32:11+00:00" title="September  8, 2011 12:32AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I brought over my copy of Fiasco and the Companion, several printed out playsets, and a copy of the mat, the tilt, and the aftermath.

No one else owned a copy, although one player did a lot of reading up on the game and checking out online playsets.

Do a little social engineering and make sure the two players most excited to try the game are at different tables. Fiasco is an easy game to understand so as long as you are available for questions, a table that gets the initial orientation and then is left to their own devices will do fine. If you want them to have a good time, just flit back and forth and don't play. A four person game is probably the sweet spot if you can swing it. If you have 10 gamers, I'd be tempted to go 3-3-4 instead of 5-5 if you have the space.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fiasco/facilitating_fiasco.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's a quick and dirty guide to facilitating Fiasco</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341928/#Comment_341928" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T07:16:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2011  7:16AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks!<br/><br/>I'll definitely try the back-and-forth thing then.

(We had a couple of other folks show up about an hour and a half late; they were happy to watch for a bit and play NPCs, themselves, every now and then).<br/><br/>We played Objective Zebra. Before the night was over the players encountered a friendly Cthulhoid monster scratching on the hull, zombies running around, the mysterious disembodied voice of someone's Dark Master and an inhuman cook with trained attack potatoes. We also came up with about half a dozen different ways for the sub to be destroyed, but somehow it emerged without a scratch.<br/><br/>It was everyone's first time playing Fiasco - and in one case, first time playing an RPG - and they LOVED it. They're definitely hooked and want to play it again some time.<br/><br/><i>(Strokes cat evilly)</i> So you see, the plan is working... <i>(INSERT MALEVOLENT LAUGHTER HERE)</i> <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
