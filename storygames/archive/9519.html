I make it a rule when I'm GMing at a con (and in that situation, I have no problem saying, "Oh, damn! Rocks fall, your guy dies!").<br/><br/>Other than that, I can't think of many "rules" that are particular to gaming situation that aren't applicable to just about any other group conversation. Let's see...<br/>I try not to let my enthusiasm dominate the group or the spotlight (hard, for me).<br/>I try to do what I can to help to manage game procedure minutiae, so the GM can focus on player interaction (e.g. looking up stuff in BW; sorting DITV dice during exchanges).<br/>As a GM, I try to provide everything needed for play, including character sheets and play aides. (This habit is born of a LOT of convention demoing and of often being the only one in my groups with the game rules.)<br/><br/>Ah... which reminds me of a bit of a peeve, which is alternately defined as "something one wants to be a rule but no one else is willing to accommodate": bring your own damned dice and pencils. Aside from VERY dice-heavy games like <i>Mechaton</i> or <i>DITV</i>, I see no reason why it's too much to ask for folks to buy a brick of d6s or a pack of d10s or a d20 set. I don't want your cooties on my Opaque Black-on-Yellows or Borealis Black-on-Clears, bub.<br/><br/>I generally try to be no more than twice as drunk as the most sober player (teetotalers are not factored into this equation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211136/#Comment_211136" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T13:54:46+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  1:54PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            we got a no electronics rules (laptops, ipods, etc ) Cells get a pass, but being stupid (ie trying to talk on one and play at the same time) gets the kick.

We get worried when someone doesn't show and no one's heard from them.<br><br>- A little distraction, interruption, joking, and table talk is totally acceptable (it's part of the social fun of gaming for our group), but you have to keep it under control.  Don't disrupt entire scenes or make other people yell to be heard over you, and if you do, apologize and STOP DOING IT.<br><br>- No TV or videogames.  Not that anyone has ever turned on the TV during a game, mind you...we just turn any TVs off before we start playing, because they're distracting.<br/><br/>- We're generally fine with cellphones and texting and the like (if you get a call, we'll wait for you to finish), but we've never played with anyone who's abused that.  No one's ever made calls to other people during a game or focused on their text messages instead of the game.  That would probably get a "c'mon, don't do that" if it ever happened.<br/><br/>- We don't have an actual rule about reading non-gaming stuff at the table (we've had players flip through catalogs or periodicals when they weren't in a scene), but it's definitely taken as a sign of disinterest.  Usually we try to correct it through stepping up the game's energy and pacing and by getting whoever's drifting away involved in the scene directly, rather than by yelling at them to put the fucking magazine down.  It usually works out okay, probably because it's not something that happens enough to warrant more direct action.<br/><br/>- If you need time to think about something, all you have to do is ask.  No one's going to yell at you or think you're a jerk if you need a minute or two to figure out what your character is going to say.  (Although if you take more than a couple of minutes, other people will probably start making suggestions and offering advice, so if you don't want that to happen, you should hurry up.)<br/><br/>- If you're unhappy with something about your character, bring it up with whoever's organizing the game and we'll get it fixed.  Especially in the first few sessions of a game, but not limited to that:  if we're twenty sessions in and you just realized that you really don't like playing that character, you should still bring it up, and we should still make whatever adjustments need to be made to fix the problem.  We want everyone to have fun.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211216/#Comment_211216" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T19:24:33+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  7:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I have to go out of earshot for a smoke, then there will be smoke breaks.

Don't let it become more than that.<br/><br/>Notify me if you can't make as early as possible.  I'll do the same in return if I have to cancel a game.<br/><br/>Phones to a minimum.  Like others here I am a parent and understand that you need to keep it on and handle any problems that come up there.<br/><br/>If we're gaming in public - No freaking the mundanes.  That rule worked well for the old Vampire LARP I was in so I kept it.<br/><br/>and finally, do not piss of Big Nate.  He's a big lovable teddy bear kind of guy until you piss him off.

I generally GM at my apartment so I'm a little more demanding about cleanup stuff.  Before giving all the "house keeping" type stuff - my favorite that I WANT everyone to follow is:<br/><br/><br/>MAKE OTHERS SHINE:  I heard this from a ad-lib troupe comedian, the idea is that everyone comes to the game trying to make each other player at the table shine.  If that means being the butt of a joke, or taking a fall, or setting someone up.  The idea is that if you strive to make each other person shine, then YOU will get that effort returned.<br/><br/><br/>Here's my general and common sense rules...<br/><br/>-  no cell phone calls, no texting, etc... Set you phone to vibrate or off.  Though we do have a player who likes to update his girlfriend on what's happening in-game by texting.  I think that's okay as long as it's not taking him out of game.<br/><br/>-  no non-game stuff.  My groups do make use of computers or anything else that makes the games more fun or engrossing, but if it becomes distracting it's OUT.  One of my players is constantly typing a recap of what's happening in-game, it helps everyone (later), and sometimes during game when we need to remember how the round went down...  <br/><br/>-  no non-game stuff...  reading books that are not the game we're playing is a general no-no at my table... definately nothing else, no other games, etc...<br/><br/>-  clean up after yourself... that includes keeping the game play area clean and clear,  if you take your shoes off (you should have at the door), or put your bag down - make sure it's OUT of the area that others will walk through or use for game space.  Shove it under your chair or take it in another room.  <br/><br/>-  food/drink is free for everyone... SHARE.  I also encourage people to bring stuff to share.  I allow everyone to use my kitchen for anything, and generally try to leave food open there - not bringing it to the game table unless it's a small portion.<br/><br/>-  if you use my stuff, clean it up.  That includes putting books and such back where you got them.  As well as putting all trash in the trash, recyclables in the recycling,  and I've got most putting used dishes in the dishwasher for me, not just the sink!<br/><br/>-  if you get something from the kitchen offer to get stuff for others...  If you're getting a drink ask everyone else if they want anything, it's curtious...<br/><br/>-  rule discussion... if we have a rule problem, we talk it over a max of about 5 minutes... I'm open (as GM) to talk about a rule but after 5 mintues I make a rule and it sticks, period.  No half-hour rule debates.<br/><br/>-  roll the damn dice... if it's close THEN we'll look up details if we need to.<br/><br/>-  know your character and their abilities.... if you don't have the book/page ready to go on your turn.  If you're doing a new action we've not used a rule for, have the book/page ready to read/explain to all.  Call out the book/page number if we have additional copies so others can look!<br/><br/>**continued**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211562/#Comment_211562" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T04:02:42+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  4:02AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -  my rule for starting play is that I need everyone to arrive then game starts about 15 minutes after the last person arrives.  It helps my sense of being a host to allow everyone a chance to relax, not making anyone feel rushed... that said...<br/><br/>-  no last minute cancellations!  It happens sometimes, game isn't more important than family or troubles, etc...  but unless it's an emergency don't cancel without letting the group know ahead of time.  Generally I like to ask if everyone's gaming 3-4 days before game (by email).  If you know you can't make it, or know you will need to cancel on a certain date - let everyone know as far in advance as possible.<br/><br/>-  I use Yahoo or Google Groups to communicate game times and discuss game questions and such during the week between games.  I require each player to post at least to tell us if they're coming or not.  I don't go with "no news is good news",  I ask that each player reply with a YES.  I'd rather know for sure than to find out too late.<br/><br/>-  Wiki or Yahoo Group everything...  I update campaign Wikis for all my campaigns.  I make individual player character pages blank for everyone to add their own backstory, etc... I also help teach the player if they don't know how to use a Wiki, it's super easy so everyone's got into it in my groups.  I also require that EVERYONE upload their character sheet to the Wiki or Yahoo Group files.  Generally any game I play will have an Excel or PDF character sheet to upload.  The idea is that the GM can download and reference the newest update at anytime for game use  and  on game day, no one ever forgets their character sheet - 'cause if they do, we just print from the upload.  simple.<br/><br/>-  I make a point not to touch anyone's dice...  I don't mind people touching mine - but I accidentally touched a player's dice directly (with my filthy GM hand) and he freaked out.  Now I make a note to use paper or pencil or whatever to push away dice to players - just to be sensitive to the fun of the superstitions.  I don't like players rolling MY personal dice set I use to GM with though... that's my thing.<br/><br/>-  in-game out-of-game.... if we're in-character roleplaying we tend to hold our hand up a little, crossing our fingers when we want to "come out" of character for rules-speak or out-of-character questions.  Not sure where I got that from.  It works well and is second nature now.<br/><br/>-  Firewalling info...  Many players I game with don't like firewalling info.  They'd rather NOT know.  Which I enjoy as well.  So I keep most info private as needed.  <br/><br/>-  Hallway conversations...  I use the hallway in front of my apt to step into for private conversations that need a few minutes.  My rule here is to do my best never to spend more than 5 minutes with any one player alone in the hallway.  More than that bores people.  I also tend to give the players I leave behind a talking point or something to consider or plan for when I return to the game.  Most times the roleplay in-character continues with the players at the table long after I'm in the hallway doing another scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>that's alot of brain dump...<br/>hope if helps someone for ideas.<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211593/#Comment_211593" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T07:27:41+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  7:27AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh!

I'm fine with any other option, from playing a different game, to watching some movies or generally hanging out, to just trying again next week, but I find it almost impossible to participate fully in a session of an ongoing game where one of the main characters is mysteriously absent/played by someone else/running on autopilot.<br/><br/>One that I'm adamant about is this: if I'm GMing, I will <i>only</i> assume (and even then often unwillingly) the level of authority required of me by the text of the game.

In one group, we'll carry on if we're one down, but not two (out of seven).  In the other, if we're even one down (out of five), we still try to meet but do something different with our time, like a one-shot, board game, or movie.<br/><br/>It's remarkable how many little unwritten rules there are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shoggoth" title="Shoggoth"><img alt="Shoggoth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shoggoth">Shoggoth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211627/#Comment_211627" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T10:17:42+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 10:17AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 10:20AM by Shoggoth.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question for everyone on a table rule that no one has brought up so far, that I will have to deal with next week when I kick off a new S7S campaign.<br/><br/>Do you keep character secrets <b>secret</b> from the other players in the game, or do you make everyone privy to the information OOC with an understanding that it is to be kept secret IC?<br/><br/>There are positive elements to both approaches.  Not everyone wants to "firewall" their IC/OOC knowledge (thanks for that phrase Kev!), and sometimes people will slip up and say something in character that they shouldn't have (or do it willfully in the case of someone who is a jerk).  On the other hand, table secrets can make the other players feel as though they are being left out of the game to some degree, especially if there is any sort of note passing or leaving the room to discuss things.  In an experienced group I feel like everyone having the secret allows other players to inform their play such that it adds heightened tension and weight to scenes where that secret can come into play.<br/><br/>One of my players has a secret identity, and he wants to keep it "secret" secret.  I'm willing to do so, but I told him that I would throw the question to the whole group and take a vote, and he's comfortable with that.  We'll see what everyone says.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211632/#Comment_211632" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T10:50:15+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 10:50AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Alex, I'm not sure that's a social rule at all.

When GM = me, quorum = three of our five players, but I might ask to put off a session if someone will be absent for a big spotlight scene and I can't figure out how to delay / defer / redirect / whatever.  Board games or IAWA are always an honorable fallback.  It's unrealistic to expect 100% attendance; we have kids and careers and vacations and so forth, so when we do have a player absence I regard it as a challenge rather than a big downer.<br/><br/>In our D&amp;D game, we ignore absences, explaining them only when convenient.  In our Mouse Guard game, we use the brilliant Mouse Guard dealing-with-absence rules.<br/><br/>We run two ongoing campaigns, ideally on alternating weeks, which is a good pace for gamemasters with busy adult lives and gives us some variety in our gaming.  We switch up games when the current GM asks for a break.<br/><br/>Other than that, we're low-maintenance.  We act like adults, answer critical cell phone calls, sometimes have a youtube derail or a bit of side reading or even a bit of crosswording.  People are welcome to my dice or any extra supplies I have.    We have a wiki that is occasionally updated.  Somehow the game goes on, and it is consistently fun and rewarding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212039/#Comment_212039" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T16:54:21+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  4:54PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We know the social rules at <i>your</i> table.
