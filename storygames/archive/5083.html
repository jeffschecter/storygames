The general rules systems are there, from ultra old school like <i>Boot Hill</i> to something like <i>Coyote Trail</i>, which has rules and whatnot set aside specifically for natives, but I was never able to get my head around how to really do the concept justice.<br/><br/>I suppose one way would be to pick a tribe and a battle (read: slaughter) to lead up to and try and build into the narrative enough emotion and excitement to make the final stand acutely painful.  That would probably be the easiest, though there's no guarantee players will bite on the character bait they're given or feel loss when it's taken away.<br/><br/>And then there's the generational saga, touching on a tribe or even a familial line over the decades: before the white man, during the uneasy years and then again when the end comes.  This would take some doing and it's also a situation where more traditional systems fall down.  In short: it'd need a story game custom-built to tell <i>this</i> story effectively.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114798/#Comment_114798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T13:01:55+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  1:01PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A <i>My Life With Master</i> hack? <i>DitV</i>, but the PCs are all Mountain Folk?

There were a lot of tribes and a lot of different responses to White agression and a lot of different outcomes.  Here in the Northwest, it's my impression that the Indians were treated less with genocidal hostility than with a crushing level of marginalization and paternalism that aimed, ultimately, to remake Indians into Whites, with the requisite suppression of local art, language and culture.  (Hence a longstanding ban on carving totem poles).  <br/><br/>You could tell some good stories around this, but it's very different than the Trail of Tears.  I wonder if a game should skew to one extreme or the other -- either a magical-realist sort of approach that tells a fanciful story, or a hyper-realistic game that focuses on real events.   <br/><br/>(As I am about to hit the "Send" button, it occurs to me that much of this is probably a reaction to the depiction of Indians in White Wolf games, and may not have any relevance to your ideas.  I'm sending it anyway.)<br/><br/>EDIT: After reading the comment about <i>Sorcerer</i>, I immediately flashed on the Ghost Dance Movement.  That would be a neat match-up of system and setting, and would satisfy the geek in me who would like the Indians to have powerz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114844/#Comment_114844" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T15:49:37+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  3:49PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're really interested, run, do not walk, and find yourself a copy of Robert Penn Warren's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394713567" rel="nofollow">Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114865/#Comment_114865" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T17:39:30+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  5:39PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think you really want a system that has a "dark end" built into it.

My point here is to demonstrate how fucked up thing were for American Indian people. I am pretty superficially educated on this stuff. But, it's enough to know that I think if we pursue RPGs about this stuff (and, I'm ALL FOR that), then it's good to get things right and realize how widespread this tragic experience was.</i><br/><br/>The Trail of Tears was the forced migration of Cherokee people, as well as other tribes including Choctaw and others, from areas in the southeastern US (Georgia and surrounding areas) to reserved lands further west, mainly in Oklahoma. It occurred in the early part of the 18th century, thanks in no small part to the fact that Andrew Jackson was about the biggest asshole we've ever seen in the presidency. <br/><br/>The forced march not only removed property rights from those people, but it also just plain ol' killed thousands of them on the move, particularly as disease set in. It was a miserable piece of shit thing for my country to have done to people. <br/><br/>Much later in the century (1870s, I think?), and much, much farther to the northwest Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce people fled the U.S. Army in Montana and Idaho, seeking to flee into Canada. Joseph's band was outnumbered, but it did manage to really harass the U.S. soldiers in pursuit. It was a pretty hopeless cause, however. This was also a miserable piece of shit thing for my country to have done to people.<br/><br/>The (mainly) Cherokee tribe and the Nez Perce tribe are pretty different cultures. But, unfortunately, their plights were all too similar. In both cases, the tribes attempted to negotiate formally with the US government, including much politicking in Washington D.C.
