                 Skip this next post if you do not like to see gears:<br/><br/><div class="Spoiler">The idea behind this is that, using the notoriously suspect math in the DMG p 82-83....<br/>four players vs four monsters.<br/><br/>Four level two players have the same xp budget thresholds as two level four PCs (including the shifted multiplier -- four monsters vs four players have a multiplier of two, four monsters vs two players have a multiplier of 2.5 ).<br/><br/>When I couldn't find the exact same, I erred in favor of the players.<br/><br/>For example, four level 1 PC have higher budget thresholds than two level twos, but lower than two level threes. So I went with level threes.<br/><br/>So that means I wanted them to be level 4 when they would normally have been level 2, level 3 when they would normally have been level 1 etc. And that's where the new curve came from.<br/><br/>But then you also have to halve the xp for the monsters... OR double every threshold on the curve is prob easier!<br/><br/>I'll do that and go back and edit!<br/><br/>The reason for halving the xp for monsters is that you would normally split an encounter's xp on four people but now you split it on two people. Uh... that's how it is!</div><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475327/#Comment_475327" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-12T19:47:48+00:00" title="July 12, 2018  7:47PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In other words, using this with two players with the exact same modules as you would with four players with the normal xp curve, all encounters with three to six monsters will have the same stated lethality according to the DMG p 82\u201383.
