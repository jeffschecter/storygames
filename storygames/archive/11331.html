I'll post more over the next few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n1a. Pride: Duke feels happy like you can't imagine happiness when he wears a woman's dress.  Happily married, he wishes he could explain this to his wife Betty and have her understanding.  For now he keeps it secret...<br/>\n<br/>\n1b. Injustice: ...or so he thinks.  Betty has seen him through the keyhole parading about in an old maternity dress he had made for "her" at the tailors.  Betty has seen what he does when he thinks no one is looking and she feels sick.  She'd turn him in if she thought she might be believed or it would not reflect poorly on her as well. Why did she have to marry the one "fancy" in Good River?   Something has to be done. What if one of their five children sees?  What if someone else finds out? She would be ruined forever. Betty thinks first of protecting her honor as a way of protecting herself.  Every man in the village lusts after her unnaturally it seems.  She chose Brother John in part because he was the strongest man in the village. And now he's proven to her that he's the weakest.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1c. Oh, we're still going.<br/>\n<br/>\n2a. Sin.  So Betty has taken up with the blacksmith, Black Jones.  It's a pet name that the villagers have for him because he is black as in African American.  A convert who came to the town looking for a better place than Back East, he settled down when the villagers of Good River didn't throw stones or curses at him out right.  The locals were unsure of him at first, but Jones acts as faithful as anyone can, and...well, if a man can make a good pair of horseshoes, reckon he's got a place, Negro or no.  Brother Eli makes a good sermon every Sunday about the tolerance of Good River and points to Black Jones as an example, a err...token of the inclusiveness of the Faith.  But if this affair got out, Brother Eli would need a new topic to fill sermon for an hour with on Sundays.  It might reflect strongly on his judgement as well.  He sees Betty as his mortal enemy, and the enemy of the whole town, making men forget themselves under the King's watchful eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\n2b. Demon Attacks.  The demons feel the sin and lust taking place in the smithy at night, and they seek to spread it.  Brother Eli has gotten some inklings of what Betty and Jones are up to. He doesn't want his token of faith to be spoiled and for his sermon to be wasted. More importantly, he has lusted after Betty for quite some time.  Eli puts his animosity for her aside and agrees to keep this secret in returns for Betty's favor.  The demons have also seen the falseness of the town's acceptance for Jones, and plant the seed in Betty's belly that will tear the town apart, driving all of Good River back into their arms.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuke frets over his wife but knows its been a long moon since they've shared the bed.  He suspects that the steward, Jebediah Crane, has eyes on her. Duke's sees potential sinners in all the men of town actually, but this who he most suspects.  Brother Jebidiah is always trying to tear Brother John down in the name of "protecting" Betty and her children.<br/>\n<br/>\n2c. The demons want the town to give up on this tolerance thing.  It wants Jones out, it wants the town to keep with its genocidal ways.  Good River used to be a home for people from Over the Border in it, but the founders (Eli's parents) purged them with black powder and blade.  To a man, to a woman, to a child.  They want the people to kill Jones, start killing every brown person they can find afterwards and not stop killing until the earth is sick and slick with blood.  The people of Good River may be "tolerant", but their roots are in killin'.  They are a warring kind and the demons reckon to remind them of that fact.  Betty is due any time now with Jone's baby. She might go into labor as the Dogs visit.<br/>\n<br/>\n6a.<br/>\nBrother Eli wants Jebediah's Stewardship.  He wants to convince the  Dogs he is the rightful steward of the town.  He also wants Betty gone gone gone, as it's going to ruin his schtick.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuke wants to find out who Betty is sleeping with and he wants that man punished.  He also doesn't want them to find out that he likes to wear dresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nJones has been conflicted, but in the end he wants to get out of town and not get lynched when the people of Good River find out what's up.<br/>\n<br/>\nJebediah Crane wants Betty too.  He wants to find some way to embarass Brother Jon so he can swoop in and take Betty and the children for his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetty isn't sure what she wants.  She wants the baby, she wants Brother Jon to stop wearing woman's clothes, she wants her life simple.  She's in the center of this and doesn't have a clear set of desires.  If she desires anything, it's not to be humiliated and dragged down in all this mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6b. Sort of discussed before, but the demons want the people to get back to the ways of their founders.  You know, killing brown people and taking their stuff.  They want Eli discredited and Jones murdered.  They want the town to feel violated and to go up in a rage across the countryside.<br/>\n<br/>\n6c.  If the dogs never came, Betty's baby would be born and the town would go nuts on so many levels.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exedore6" title="exedore6"><img alt="exedore6" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exedore6">exedore6</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251831/#Comment_251831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T12:16:45+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 12:16PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting this Quinn. <br/>\n<br/>\nDisclosure - I was one of the players in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's nice to see how the town's progression matches up with what happened in play                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
