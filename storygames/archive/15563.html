I suspect that it's not so much that introductory sheets need to be different (though you could make such sheets with more of an emphasis on walking players through the process) as that character sheets in general could stand to improve.<br/><br/>For ditching the character sheet, I think it really depends on how you do it. You can get by without a character sheet per se in Fiasco for example, but my experience with RPG and RPG-ish games from Fantasy Flight has been that at a certain point turning character options into components becomes burdensome to play. In our failed attempt to play Mansions of Madness it felt like you could easily reduce the number of components by a third or more by just having character sheets (or maybe Apocalypse World style printable playbooks), resulting in a much smoother play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352718/#Comment_352718" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-29T11:00:37+00:00" title="December 29, 2011 11:00AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like this is difficult to talk about without an example.

How does that detract from the game at all?  I'm inclined to take out unnecessary stuff with a straight-razor. In my mind, that's not redesigning the game but deciding what parts of it to present to this particular audience.  Presenting them with everything, right from the get-go, seems like a fool's errand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352740/#Comment_352740" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-29T13:46:15+00:00" title="December 29, 2011  1:46PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends how long you're playing. <br/><br/>15 minutes, it's ok to take it out. 30, maybe. 1 hour, I would say no.<br/><br/>Why? <br/><br/>If I'm playing a Rogue with great initiative (very likely), then removing flat-footed screws me. Some of my best abilities rely on me catching people flat-footed, having a better chance to hit, and doing extra damage with Sneak Attack. <br/><br/>If I'm playing a Wizard, and there is no touch-attack, I'm going to miss most of my spells. It's even worse than taking out flat-footed for Rogues. <br/><br/>That said, I could maybe see taking these options out for the players but keeping them for the monsters. That way Rogues and Wizards still get to do cool things against monsters but the monsters don't gain the same benefit against the players. <br/><br/>I think overall you can simplify games. Take the D&amp;D Boardgames (Castle Ravenloft, Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt). They still feel vaguely like D&amp;D without the complexity. But the overall game has been simplified, not just a few aspects. If you simplify a few aspects, then it's much better playing a Fighter than anything else. People playing a Wizard may quickly look at everyone else and think, "why are these people having much more fun than me?"<br/><br/>Looks like a small change but has huge consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352744/#Comment_352744" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-29T14:15:28+00:00" title="December 29, 2011  2:15PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Teataine posted this ages ago, a friendly Pathfinder sheet.

Write down whatever the game asks you to write down.</p>\n<p>As you play, maybe highlight the stuff you <em>actually used.</em> Also, write other things on your sheet as you judge them to be useful - procedure summaries, references to key items in the book, information that you feel you'll want to reference often as you play. Keep playing, highlight the stuff you added and kept using, and kill the stuff that didn't turn out to be all that helpful.</p>\n<p>When you stop changing data fields, you'll have a list of information that your sheet needs to show. Now you should start thinking about where those items need to be in relation to one another. At some point you should think about how best to represent your data - do you write down numbers, fill in bars, interlock gears? Writing down strings is great for values that don't change, fixed ranges that shift a lot might benefit more from some kind of progress bar that you can put a clip or other marker on, some things work best as landing spots for tokens or dice.

Instead of touch attack, give the Wizard a bonus from their main class stat. Instead of flatfooted being a different AC, give the attacker a +4 bonus. Players looking for nods to realism may complain. But these same players probably would prefer that armor reduces damage rather than make you harder to hit. And there are situations where a character who is all physical armor and has no dex bonus would complain because when they are flat footed, their AC remains the same. It's a no win unless you aim to please a very specific audience (probably a small subset of D&amp;D players).<br/><br/>It comes back to what J. Walton says above. Part of the problem with the character sheet is the system! <br/><br/>It's the main reason the first page I flip to in a game book I'm considering buying is the character sheet.

The GM could do all the bookkeeping if that made the storytelling easier for the player.

Write down whatever the game asks you to write down.As you play, maybe highlight the stuff you<em>actually used.</em>Also, write other things on your sheet as you judge them to be useful - procedure summaries, references to key items in the book, information that you feel you'll want to reference often as you play. Keep playing, highlight the stuff you added and kept using, and kill the stuff that didn't turn out to be all that helpful.</blockquote>\nShreyas: This is extremely poignant and solid advice.<br/><br/>Anyway, if someone wants to see a mini-study in changing up character sheets, here's an example from a game that'll hopefully be done with layout shortly. So here is the original character sheet for the game, pretty much almost copied as-is from the original Japanese design (a great attempt at that!):<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/sheets/TBZ-Sheet01thumb.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/sheets/TBZ-Sheet02thumb.jpg"/><br/><br/>Solid sheet, all the attributes skills etc where you expect them.<br/><br/>Other attempts - and great ones - are here, to take the same info and lay it out in a new, interesting way:<br/><a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/design.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/design.html</a><br/>(these are "two pages", but the original sheet was an A4 sheet in Landscape orientation, and looked exactly like these two sheets next to each other, just on one side of the paper).<br/><br/>Based on that (and a design that kinda failed in a few ways by the otherwise excellent G Zitelli), I commissioned this one from Ben Morgan:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/kirie.jpg"/><br/><br/>Here are the important pieces that led me to this layout:<br/>1) The background picture is a "Meikyo soul-mirror", one of the core items that summarizes the setting of the game in one picture.<br/>2) I removed the detailed but very important reference to what Aiki/Kiai does on the top and original sheets. Mainly because I wanted the character sheet to be a solid reference of Stuff that Changes or needs to be recorded, and plan on taking the Aiki/Kiai explanation sheet to its own printable reference page (or bookmark or something like that). Once people get good at the game they won't need it anyway. I found this out through play.<br/>3) Kiai and Karma are extremely important, and through play I realized that they needed to be more front-and-center than the wound charts and stuff. Bumped that to the top of the sheet.<br/>4) I kept the Character Sketch Box. In the West, who really ever does this? But in Japan, folks often do a little character sketch to make the character more their own. Many games from that era have such a box, and in online replays and the like it's almost always filled in. So I wanted to keep that tether to its Japanese roots, rather than say to make the Equipment box bigger and more useful.<br/>5) The major thing was this, though: The FATES are in the Exact Center of the sheet, with everything else in a spiral around it. That is the true center of the character. In actual role-playing (the playing of roles, not the game) it is very much used more than any other piece of the sheet. More than that, it is the spiritual core of the game. I normally introduce it as the most important part of the game, the part that gives it meaning, far moreso than the stats and skills and stuff. To "put my money where my mouth is", I took the initiative for this English version to go ahead and actually make that area the most important thing on the sheet, rather than (as was in the original sheet) not something on the right-hand-side/"reverse side".<br/>That decision, too, came out of play. I kept telling people that these FATES are the most important part of their gaming experience... and pointing to them on the sheet in the far right bottom part of the sheet. I mean, it's all one sheet so as long as it's there somewhere it should be okay. But to emphasize their importance I had them put right in the center.<br/><br/>Hopefully that shows a little of the evolution of a character sheet through focus (conscious choices to emphasize what the producer thinks of the most important parts of the game) and play (making more-used stuff easier to reference).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

No small feat!<br/><br/>I've seen mixed reactions to the character sheets in play from people used to the old sheets. Flipping to the back of the sheets for seemingly crucial information seems counter intuitive but very specifically designed. The goal is to focus on your Beliefs, Goals, and Relationships, not what skills are you best at. But for experience players, this can be frustrating.
