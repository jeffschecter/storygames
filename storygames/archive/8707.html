It's a little bit like 1,001 Nights with one layer of abstraction removed, but not quite.<br/><br/>Imagine this: you've got a fairly normal game--space opera, dungeoneering, whatever--with one twist: the CHARACTERS all know that they are characters in a roleplaying game.  In addition to their normal stats, they all have a Passion or Love or whatever for one of the Players--NOT their own.<br/><br/>The players are not permitted to acknowledge aloud that they know that their characters know this, but, of course, need to subtly influence the way they play their characters so that they successfully impress the desired player.<br/><br/>There's a lot of ways this could go.  Here's one: at the end of a session of play, or maybe a short campaign arc depending on length, the CHARACTER who has accrued the most mojo (XP, fan mail, artha, etc.) gets to be played, for one session, by the object of their desire.  That session will be the climactic one for that character, after which, they are out of play--they, in some sense, become real.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets trippier!  What if the player who has now lost their character now comes to the table and, at the table-chatter level, plays the role of this former RPG character who now inhabits the real world, and looks down on but wants to help his former compatriots who are still trapped?<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Anna's character Timbor is in love with Rachel, Rachel's character Sartarion is in love with me, and Phil's character Lifben is in love with Rachel.<br/><br/>(I think you wouldn't want different characters to love each others' players, because then everyone winds up happy, and we wouldn't want that.)<br/><br/>After the first round (or session or whatever) of play, Timbor has more Mojo than anyone else.  Anna and Rachel switch characters for the next round, which consists of some sort of climactic plot for Timbor.  Then, the next round, Anna is still playing Sartarion, while Rachel is playing Timbor playing a new character that Timbor made up.  That is, Rachel's table-chatter is from Timbor's point of view.<br/><br/>So, I guess this idea is kind of like 1,001 Nights in reverse.<br/><br/>(BTW, I'd really love to do this without actually designing a new game\u2014I see it as more of a really fucked-up add-on.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192955/#Comment_192955" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T12:50:39+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 12:50PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>It's Complicated</i> springs to mind, with a mandatory Oddity of "loves X's player."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mikael" title="Mikael"><img alt="Mikael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mikael">Mikael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192965/#Comment_192965" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T13:44:13+00:00" title="February 17, 2009  1:44PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like!

Instead I would let one game be only one rather long meeting, chopped up into several short plays. Perhaps I would skip the part where the adored player plays the character in the table top game. Maybe. The important thing would be that during the night each player gets possessed by at least one character. The player will still be herself, but she will at the same time be possessed by the character. They will share memories and be in conflict over what actions to take. (A super expensive, one month long, larp on rather scale with this theme (hrm...state funded...) has been perfomed in Sweden, so I'm somewhat influenced by that). <br/><br/>If you don't like the layered version you could also play it in a way that you decide to turn it into a more clear cut larp as the game progresses. In any the case the details would have to be made more clear than I do here.<br/><br/>Basically the game will start as a tabletop and then during the night be transformed into a larp with the characters now bringing their issues into the real world.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing with Matt's idea is that you are during the game grooming each others characters and slowly handing them over to each other before you transform into a full blown larp. The player who know he will be handed the character will squirm everytime it's given a problematic trait or something that hints to him as a person. Som many possibilities. <br/><br/>I got all giddied up now. I could really see myself playing this with my old group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
