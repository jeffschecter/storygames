(For lots of complex reasons with lots of plot intertwined. Good ol' plot.) The village stands at the edge of an endless icy tundra, and an ancient spirit possessed forest. Aside from defending a hidden monastery of monks, the village is nestled at the top of a massive crater, facing the tundra. Cracked chasm protects the village from the barren tundra, and 200 foot walls descend into the valley. A waterfall of water coming out of a subterranean reservoir pours out into the village past a pagoda and defended bridge, and falls down the walls of the village, into the crater, which is plowed as a massive, several mile wide rice field. The defended many tiered steps to the village face the forest. Two bridges cross the river in the rice field, with one bridge closest to the walls of the city. On the far side past the bridges lay the defended mountain pass up to the tundra. Previous missions lead to the PCs defending wave after wave of enemies at the entrance to the chasm, to a shield wall cannon pressed push, with a demon boss monster, to force the battle to the last defended position before the rice field.<br/><br/>Under the torchlight of the mountain pass and with their shields raised, the army looks like a weaving dragon. Its' maw has just opened, the cannon defended and damaged shield wall opened, spewing several hundred smaller denizens of the army out into the rice fields. It consists of about a hundred level 4 goblins with shotguns, a hundred level 5 guys with 10 extra chips and two weapons, and many many level 6 and 7 bosses with guns, grenades, bazookas, etc. Two gigantic cauldrons, and the leader of the army has just emerged from the pass. Rows of goblins with drums change rhythms to give everyone in the army different bonuses at different times. Bonuses like +10% to skills, and so forth. Since the battle is taking place realistically, the parties plan on seriously and completely defending the town. This means a huge number of sessions. We've already gone through 5 in the pass, and I'm leading you up to the past 2 in the valley. The highest level characters, the Berzerker Perrin, with the creeping sickness and crazy frenzy and spin barbarian moves as I'd outlined, and the trickster Shea with his cloned attacks, a chainsaw and a gas mask. They managed to kill the tentacled arm on the hook beast that had been created by the sickness Poisoning the giant pile of dead bodies that became a boss... but not before the hook beast killed all the archers in the pass, and did an evil breath attack which turned the PC's of my friend Adam who left for university into evil characters. They let Perrin and Shea run away into the rice field.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a mage character which had been invisible the entire time, silently watching the events unfold, decided to travel across the rice plains to explore the forest. It's then that the defense of the pass was breached, and the enemies began pouring into the fields. He met up with a village samurai that was looking for a villager who had passed out drunk in the rice fields earlier. The mage intervened, and helped them. The samurai went off towards the village, and the Mage ended up heading to the second bridge, the one farther away from the town to defend a siege.<br/><br/>(A huge battle took place on the bridge, consider all of this abbreviated out, in order to get to the pictures. At one point someone else's starting level Cleric and Mage entered the combat to really really help turn the tide. They had come to the town to get supplies, and fallen asleep piss drunk with the drunken villager, only to wake up, with him gone, and huge battle waging all around them, particularly on the bridge 12 squares away. Ultimately the bridge was successfully defended, leaving the leader of the wave to flee and gather new men for the second attack.)<br/><br/>The retreating goblin lord, started getting the attention of various troops in the field by using a squelching radio and feedback. From the beginning of the session it's planned that in 20 innings the next wave of the attack will press over this bridge. To the north, a wave of goblins that swam the river to attack the bridge from the other side are being cut off by a squad of villagers. To the south, the wave of reinforcements from the village are being cut off by another wave goblins from the water. Each battle was taking place 2 innings away, so it would take time to move characters there and back. Each character that stayed behind was also allowed to move 1 sandbag anywhere on the bridge each inning. The Mage and Zoland decided to head to the south, in order to secure reinforcements during the bridge battle, while the other mage and cleric set up some sand bags. Here's how it looked after 2 innings. The camel cash are used to divide battle areas for things taking place in different areas. The white paper is the stone walls to the bridge. The blue chips are sand bags.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/3640/fullkn1.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>They broke through the rice fields to come across a small scuffle between 10 LV 4 shotgun goblins, and a couple of archers and spearmen. The other mage and cleric abandoned the sandbags, and ran off towards the scuffle. They made quick work of the goblins, sending the archer and spearman that survived back to the bridge to set up the sandbags. The party, together, moved towards the larger battle between a small horde of goblins and all the archers and spearman that should have been reinforcements in the turns before. Here's what it looked like after a few archers had been slain. The men in green are more powerful goblins.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/91/hpim0061yi8.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma" title="LordZoma"><img alt="LordZoma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma">LordZoma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88685/#Comment_88685" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T03:03:43+00:00" title="August 18, 2007  3:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This battle was small with weak units compared to the others that have gone on in the campaign, but it's supposed to be 'realistic' and was also designed to help the brand new mage and cleric, and the virtually new mage to get more powerful so they can survive the harder waves. Short work were made of these goblins , and a more powerful squad of goblins rose up out of the water. The leader of the goblin squad that had been crossing the river and his cohorts. They were a mix of level 5, 6, and 7, with hundreds of extra wounds. Double shotguns, grenades, and a Lv7 trickster that could jesters choice, moving and attacking and getting in people's squares. Here the PCs and NPCs were ready to defend when they were coming out of the water. The PCs kicked these guys asses in. Mage's are really really powerful when used in conjunction with support characters to help stave off attacks. It's not just the wounds that make the bad guy, it's how well they work together, and the most important advantage is sheer numbers. Even though the goblins were fairly powerful, they were outnumbered by their opponents, which included spell casters. This meant a tough road to victory for them. Of course, they failed.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/2497/bosseswm0.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img182.imageshack.us/img182/2276/bossmiddlema4.jpg"/><br/><br/>By the time they killed the last of the goblins, freeing the way for further reinforcements to arrive, 18 innings had passed, giving them exactly 2 innings to get back to the bridge which had exactly every sandbag properly aligned in a crazy choke point.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Shea and Perrin have split up, with Perrin heading towards the first bridge, and Shea heading towards the second. Shea, at the beginning of the 20 inning count until the second bridge assault, was 10 innings away from the bridge on the attacking side, but random squads of tough troops were scouting him out, calling him and Perrin the unclean ones that need to be purged. Shea managed to travel nowhere before he was ambushed by 2 lv 5 goblins, 2 lv 6 beasts, and a lv 7 goblin with a huge sword. Of course they all had extra wounds (20-70 chips) and random abilities and whatnot. Also the effect of the drums gave them all +10% CR and let the monsters attack before the PCs.<br/><br/>Shea has the ability that lets him spend 3 spoints to cause a bleeding wound that deals chip damage every round to a unit until they heal themselves. Shea jumped from guy to guy causing the inevitably fatal strike. The goblins got wise, and one pulled the pins in all of his grenades, grabbing onto Shea and holding him for the explosion. Later, they cornered him into a square, where a pile of grenades were prepped to go off. Here's a shot of him pouncing out of a square in danger as the explosion goes off. He's the silver dwarf in the same square as one of the goblins. You can clearly see how we use the black chips for level, blue chips for 10chip stacks, and white chips for 1. Red chips for LAP and Elite chips. It's great. Naturally the level chips get taken away last.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/3759/sheadn9.jpg"/><br/><br/>Though Shea pwned these guys in only 7 rounds before he ran away, leaving them to bleed to death, he lost all his wounds and a couple of phew points. He also failed to kill them before they got a flare into the air, alerting the army of his immediate, and too close for comfort, location. 4 innings closer to the bridge, and 9 before the bridge attack, he got ambushed again. One future session involves Perrin fighting his way to the first bridge to set up defense, Shea fighting his way to the second to set up defense, and then a simultaneous assault on both bridges.<br/><br/>Most recently, the returning cleric Quill, mage Delark, Zoland, and the mage Noraku returned to the bridge. Quill and Delark split up to assist the troops to the north that were being flanked by a squad of orcs from the forests while they were dealing with the shotgun gretchin crossing the river. They fought along the riversides, until pressing deep into the rice fields to get to the battle. A brief skirmish with several squads of gretchin that had pushed into some other troops, now that reinforcements were freely moving to the north, allowed them to gather a handful of archers and spearmen.<br/><br/>They marched north, and heard the marching of the attacking squads. They were faced with a wave of 10 gretchin carrying the shotguns and grenades, who had heavier kevlar on, as well as several orcs with grenade launchers, some with flame throwers, 6 with automatic rifles, and 1 that had set up a chain gun. Blue chips in the center of the board marked where the columns of tall rice were. Units in the rice could see out one column, but units in the clear couldn't see into the rice. Rice in the battle gets trampled down after a few rounds of battle, and the flame throwers were burning the rice to provide a clear line of shot for the orc with the chain gun. I'l lprovide some random pictures for the battle. It was violent and bloody. The mage was throwing newly created spells left and right, raining ice and fire into the fields, while ordnance blasts from the enemy grenade launchers rocketed down all around them. Reinforcements consistently arrived on the field, but they were ceaselessly slaughtered by barrages of rifle and shotgun fire. The battle raged for too long time wise, and we were forced to call it quits when it was boiling down to a close. You may see a floating drone, which is a summoned monster by the mage. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/2711/hpim0066hr0.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/1251/hpim0067vp7.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/4702/hpim0068it5.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/9346/hpim0069fp7.jpg"/><br/><br/>Taken after cleanup.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://img147.imageshack.us/img147/5742/hpim0078wa0.jpg"/><br/><br/>Play mechanics in our version of WEGS vary from the official version, since officially, the game is not out yet, and we hacked the system.
