But the other nine tend to question his/her actions, insisting that they have to agree on the Most Perfect Way first.<br/><br/>What do you do? <br/><br/>One way of solving this is to give the nine babblers a complex task to work on, telling them: "This is REALLY important!" And then you give the doer the actual task, which is pretty simple, and let him/her sit quietly in a corner and work on it.<br/><br/>To me, this seems to be one of the many functions of complex systems in role-playing games. "Learn these REALLY important rules with the busybody part of your mind! They're what the game is really about! And, occasionally, there'll be some work making up stories and characters, but don't worry too much about that, it's not important. Just let the quiet worker figure it out."<br/><br/>It's like we sometimes just need to distract our Big Heads with rules, so that our creative voice can speak freely.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141352/#Comment_141352" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-26T04:38:17+00:00" title="April 26, 2008  4:38AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I'd say...you know those old lady/young lady optical illusions?

For some people this is pretty easy to do - they just accept whatever weird or obvious ideas pop up in their heads, and apply them straight away. For others, where the critical/analytical part of the mind is well-developed/over-developed/hyperactive/always in control, one helpful technique can be to distract that part of the mind with other work so that the creative parts can come up with ideas that pass "under the radar", so to speak. <br/><br/>An example of how this might conceivably work:<br/><br/>A. Jack is playing an RPG. The GM says: "So what do you do when you meet the half-orc?" Jack's mind comes up with a few thoughts - "we should kick the half-orc! no, we can't do that, it would probably bite our foot off or something. let's use a sword! uh, that's too obvious, we're always using a sword, the others will think we have no imagination. let's see... a big, purple fireball? shaped like a... toad? no, argh, that's too silly!" Jack says "Uhh...."<br/><br/>B. Jack is playing an RPG. The GM says: "So you meet the half-orc. You have to fight - roll for initiative!" Jack uses sub-clause IX which lets him add +11 to his initiative dice. The GM says: "How many attacks do you have, with how many seconds between them?" Jack calculates the numbers using the matrix on page 93, double-checking his results and dropping a few comments about how this rule could be improved by making it a bit more realistic. The GM says: "So how do you attack?" Jack says: "I kick him, then I chop him with the sword." Jack doesn't have to think twice about what his character does - the rest of his mind is so occupied with the Important Rules that the creative part can just say whatever it wants, and socially, there's no big pressure on him to Be Creative; the pressure is to Use The Rules Correctly.<br/><br/>Note that I'm saying it's only one possible technique. And I'm not saying it's the only value of complex systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141413/#Comment_141413" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T08:31:01+00:00" title="April 27, 2008  8:31AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Jack doesn't have to think twice about what his character does - the rest of his mind is so occupied with the Important Rules that the creative part can just say whatever it wants, and socially, there's no big pressure on him to Be Creative; the pressure is to Use The Rules Correctly.</blockquote>\nThis is partially connected to the "constraints improve creativity" idea, I think; Jack's not paralyzed by infinite choices (giant-toad shaped purple fireball or sword or ninja-kick or whatever), he's got the game mechanics telling him what is effective and maybe even what is possible, and can quickly narrow down that smaller list of options to arrive at a decision that satisfies him.  In other words, perhaps it's less about the creative side getting to say whatever it wants and more about giving the creative side some structure and guidelines to channel it more effectively.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(I'm not entirely sold on what you seem to be saying, except in a lukewarm "Yeah, that's one way of looking at a tiny part of it" kind of way; I guess I'm just not seeing what the payoff to this analogy is supposed to be?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141414/#Comment_141414" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T09:06:39+00:00" title="April 27, 2008  9:06AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2008 10:32AM by chearns.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br/><br/>so you're suggesting that complex rules may act as a structure that support creatives thought (either due to intention or as a side-effect)? Like, all these rules exist, not to make the game more realistic or crunchy or tactical, but rather to keep the analytic part of our brains occupied so that they don't interfere with our creative brains?<br/><br/>This is interesting because when I do brainstorming in a group I always tell everyone (including myself) to not evaluate any ideas until we're done brainstorming. To just write down all the ideas, because once you start inspecting the ideas, then that's where your focus will be and the brainstorming will stop. And you're suggesting that complex rules may be doing the same thing, although in a completely different way.<br/><br/>What I am wondering though is whether or not people are at their most creative playing the complex games or not. It's been many many many years (yes, three manys) since I've played a really crunchy game in the sense you're talking about in your example, so I have no idea how creative I was in those games.<br/><br/>EDIT: This isn't me disagreeing with you or arguing, this is me saying I think this idea is nifty and worth exploring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141418/#Comment_141418" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T09:54:26+00:00" title="April 27, 2008  9:54AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2008 9:57AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And looking back at the original post, something that struck me:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>So you're leading a team that consists of nine <i>busybodies</i> - people who, when given a task, want to talk, discuss, debate, argue and find the Most Perfect Way to do stuff.<br/><br/>And there's one <i>quiet worker</i> - who, when given a task, will just go ahead and do it. But the other nine tend to question his/her actions, insisting that they have to agree on the Most Perfect Way first.</blockquote>\nOn the face of it, this is just another way of describing the difference between extroverts (energized by social interactions, find it easiest to complete their thoughts out loud and with other people) and introverts (must spend energy to interact socially, find it easiest to complete thoughts in private), and assigning some kind of value judgement to that isn't very wise.  Nine people discussing how to begin a task can be extremely effective, if all nine of them are people who work best that way.  Likewise, one person working alone can be effective if it's a person who works best alone.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the one person working alone can benefit from the work done by the nine people -- and make no mistake, it can absolutely be valuable work -- because these aren't isolated systems.  This is especially true as a gaming-brain analogy, because it's not like you can do something creative and follow complex rules without being aware of both processes.  There's no hidden creative core doing its own thing in the corner while you're crunching the numbers and consulting the rulebook: it's all one process.  What you're getting out of thinking about the rules will inevitably inform your creative decisions, the same way that the hypothetical introvert worker can (and will, in every halfway-functional workplace I've ever been in) draw upon the extroverted workers' discussions as a resource.<br/><br/><br/>...which leads right back to the later example with Jack and the half-orc, which is just Blank Page Paralysis all over again.  It's not that the complex rules in B are somehow distracting 90% of Jack's giant brain with busywork so that the remaining 10% can somehow sneak past his critical analysis and pop out something creative without filtering, it's that the complex rules are guiding 100% of Jack's brain in a direction that says "here are a set of things that make sense and work in this situation, and these are the differences between them."  The filter is incorporated in the process: rather than coming up with ten thousand creative possibilities and then winnowing them down to the one that Jack chooses to do, Jack is evaluating each creative possibility as it occurs to him and using the rules to steer his creative input all along the way, until he's at the end and can choose from the half-dozen or so options that prevailed.<br/><br/>And again, this has kind of a "...yeah, so?" quality to it, because it just seems to say that some people are going to like a complex system and find that it makes their creative process run more smoothly, and some people aren't.  That's not exactly a revelation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141438/#Comment_141438" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T14:40:01+00:00" title="April 27, 2008  2:40PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthijs,<br/><br/>In your example A, your player has two decisions: to attack or try peaceful approach, and once that's decided, the details of the approach. So of course, he hesitates.<br/><br/>In example B, the GM has already determined the first decision. The players lack of hesitation has nothing to do with the complex math in between, he just has fewer decisions to make. <br/><br/>Obviously, high rules complexity does not generate more creative RPG play than low rules complexity. You just have to play PTA or one of many other low complexity rulesets to see this.<br/><br/>However, I definitely believe that constraints are an important part of good creative output -- but there's such a thing as too much constraint too. You have to leave the field open for the _kind_ of creative output you want. In example be you constrained the creative output to one choice: How do I attack the orc. That's fine if you want your game to be about killing things and taking their stuff. <br/><br/>But what if you want to give the players freedom to make thematic choices? That's where we see different kinds of constraints -- eg you can only play a Trollbabe and you agree to engage with the story you encounter, you can only play a character in a prime time tv show who has an issue to explore, etc. <br/><br/>There's no magic in providing complex rules. The magic is in defining the play field, giving the players something to run with, then leaving the field unobstructed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141453/#Comment_141453" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T17:19:58+00:00" title="April 27, 2008  5:19PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't you just do this by the rule saying 'Describe your attack.
