We had fun, and in general, I'd call the night a success.  However, there was some confusion with some parts of the game, rules-wise.  I think some of this will clear up as we become more familiar with it (as the Antagonist, I probably didn't have the rules down *quite* as well as I should have).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd enjoy input from John, or anyone else out there with Agon experience.  I have a few different confusions, but I don't really feel like laying them all out right now, so I'll just start with the biggest one.<br/><br/>Exactly why is the Shield ability useful?  There are obviously a lot of different weapon/ability/hand combinations for any given exchange of a battle, but I'm having a bit of difficulty figuring out why someone would want to advance his or her Shield behind d6 rather than ratcheting up Sword or Spear and simply putting a weapon die and an ability die in the left hand when it's necessary to focus on defense.

Help me see it, please!</blockquote>\nThe main reason people use a shield in games I've run is this:<br/><br/>When in combat, there are a limited number of left-hand/right-hand combinations.  For close combat, you can have Sword/Sword, Sword/Shield or Spear/Shield.  Using a Shield means you get to add the Shield Ability die into the mix.  It's only ever used for defence, but the thing to remember is that Swords always have 2d6, they never get better.  Sure, you can crank up your Sword ability die size, but you can also use that Sword Ability die defensively along with your Shield die and your Shield Ability die in an emergency if you need to.<br/><br/>The weapon combinations ARE pretty balanced though, and using (say) Swords/Sword or Sword/Shield and having a rubbish Shield ability early in the game is perfectly valid and works well exactly as you describe.  But later on (once you've earned some Advances) you're going to benefit from higher die sizes in Shield, because it means you can both attack and defend effectively on the same turn.<br/><br/>Using the example of a fairly typical combat focused "early level" or starting PC, they'll typically have something like:<br/><br/>D6 name<br/>D10 Sword<br/>D8 Shield<br/><br/>Lets say they're using Sword/Sword and going for full-on attack.  They'll get:<br/><br/>Attack: d6 (name) d10 (Sword Ability) 2d6 (Sword in right hand) d6 (Die moved over from left hand sword)<br/>Defence: d6 (remaining die from left hand sword)<br/><br/>In full-on defence, they get:<br/><br/>Defence: d6 (name) d10 (Sword Ability) 2d6 (Sword in left hand) d6 (Die moved over from right hand sword)<br/>Attack: d6 (remaining die from right hand sword)<br/><br/>If they're using Sword/Shield, for full attack they'll have:<br/><br/>Attack: d6 (name) d10 (Sword Ability) 2d6 (Sword in right hand)<br/>Defence: d8 (Shield Ability) d8 (Shield)<br/><br/>So a d6 less.  In full defence, they'd be rolling:<br/><br/>Attack: d6 (Remaining die from Sword)<br/>Defence: d8 (Shield Ability) d8 (Shield) d6 (Die moved over from Sword) d6 (name) d10 (Sword Ability) <br/><br/>Quite a bit more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98535/#Comment_98535" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T05:21:35+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  5:21AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 5:22AM by Mel_White.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>...

Only one Ability die can be selected as part of the Battle dice.  So the combatant would have to select the Shield Ability or the Sword Ability, not both.  The second of the two Ability dice (that is, the Ability not selected) could be added in as a Creative Ability die but then it would suffer impairment.  And this may be what Rich means by 'in an emergency'.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98540/#Comment_98540" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T05:53:08+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  5:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I recall it, that's incorrect.

In fact, once, one was about to call on an Oath that would have pulling in the other person's spear die, but decided not to because he didn't want to impair him.  And they weren't using creative abilities that much. In fact, why would you, in battle?  It would be pretty short sighted to bring in battle abilities as creative abilities in the middle of a battle, wouldn't it?  You'd get an advantage for one single roll, and the cost of impairing your ability for the rest of that battle, if not more!  I can only really imagine doing that if you were bringing in Shield creatively and you never use the ability otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98548/#Comment_98548" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T06:51:37+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  6:51AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I'm still confused about this.

But any other ability, including battle abilities used as creative abilities, would be.  And it's legitimate to throw in a battle ability as a creative ability if needed.  So, if your d10 sword ability rolls a 1 and the sword weapon dice both roll a 1 and a 2 (or whatever), pull out that spear and roll the, let's say, d8 spear ability die.  Chances are the result will be better--recognizing that the spear ability impairs to d6.  I also think we'd ignore range penalties for a battle ability added as a creative ability nor would the weapon dice change. <br/>So, getting back to the original post, a high Shield Abilty will last longer and potentially be more effective in a battle when used as a creative ability, meaning that a combatant's defense will be stronger without penalizing offensive ability.  I imagine that the situation requiring the best defense may also require the best offense!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98554/#Comment_98554" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T07:01:54+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  7:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>pull out that spear and roll the, let's say, d8 spear ability die.

It comes now to player style.  Heroes 'should' be calling on oaths from their comrades in battle--it's the best of both worlds!  The comrade's ability is impaired and the die may actually help.  Note also that the hero fulfilling the oath gets to decide which ability to grant...a hero can't actually call in an oath for a specific ability.  Just be sure to build up those oaths owed to you!  I'm being a bit flippant--there's a fine line between what's good for the group versus what's good for an individual hero.  But the point of the 'scoring' or experience mechanism in the game is to gain individual Glory.    <br/><br/>As far as the strategic wisdom of impairing an ability at a point in time at the cost of that ability being less effective in the future...if it's the difference between success or failure now, then the risk may be worth it.  Survive the battle and the heroes can restore abilities with an Interlude scene.  Lose the battle and the saved ability is wasted.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98572/#Comment_98572" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T08:09:30+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>pull out that spear and roll the, let's say, d8 spear ability die.

You can use <b>any</b> other abilities as creative abilities for extra dice. If a creative ability happens to be a weapon ability, ranges and such don't matter. You don't even have to be holding the weapon. Just say how that ability helps you, is all.<br/><br/>So... what the heck is the Shield ability good for? The answer is: two things. One of which isn't explicitly in the book. :-)<br/><br/>1. Shield is the only "dump stat" in the game. It's kind of a positive dump stat, though. Basically, you can pretty much assume that you won't ever have to use Shield in a contest. It might come up in some odd situation, but it'll be rare. This means that using Shield for extra creative ability dice (and impairing it) isn't a big deal, in terms of weakening you for future contests. Shield is a great catch-all source for extra dice in battle when you need them. Cranking your Shield up to d10 gives you three pretty good helping dice (d10, d8, d6) at pretty much zero risk.<br/><br/>2. You use the Shield ability to defend other people. The book doesn't explain this, which is totally my fault. Every ability in Agon has its own "special thing" right? This is the special thing for Shield. Here's what you do:<br/><br/>- If you're in the same range band as someone you want to protect, you can give them your Shield ability die to add to their left hand.<br/>- You can only do this if you're wielding a shield.<br/>- Doing this does not impair your Shield ability.<br/>- You can certainly charge an Oath (or two) for this.<br/><br/>And yes, two or more heroes can do this for each other, forming a shield wall.<br/><br/>If you're an archer type, call in some Oaths to make someone position with you and give their Shield die to cover you while you shoot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98654/#Comment_98654" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:57:02+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:57AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops, sorry.

I can see how this could be useful to go full defense, but I ended up going full offense with an NPC in our game (he was an archer with the Swift special power and hence was doing well at staying out of range of the PCs who were using melee weapons to fight some minions, but once they killed the minions they switched to ranged to fire back at him) and if this is allowed, I wondered what happens when you attack someone who has no dice in their left hand.  Does the attack automatically hit?  This is the way we played it, which means that I never again left an NPCs left hand completely empty.  They hit him quite hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98765/#Comment_98765" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T15:09:38+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  3:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, you can have zero dice in a hand.

As my book is close, I can check... and the winner of each refreshment challenge gets 1 glory.<br/><br/>Every other simple challenge along on the quest should earn glory.<br/><br/>I think (and have been playing) that glory in battle only comes from defeating enemies, but I;m not 100% sure on that so I'll wait for someone more qualified to confirm that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99144/#Comment_99144" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T00:17:17+00:00" title="September 26, 2007 12:17AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike has it right.<br/><br/>In battle, you earn glory from killing opponents and also from winning any advantage contest you try during the fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99390/#Comment_99390" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T20:12:15+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  8:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your help everybody...<br/>I think I only have one last question.<br/>What about weapons besides swords, spears, javelins, bows, and shields?<br/>Is there any reason why, as the Antagonist, I can't or shouldn't modify weapon stats for NPCs?

As I recall, each Strife increase a die size to the next level, so you can spend up and give the bad guy swords with 2d10/2d10 if you want (or whatever). Plus, with NPCs the weapons do not have to be the same - you can narrate it differently (although it will still be treated in the same way as the base weapon).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99441/#Comment_99441" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T06:26:01+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  6:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think the increasing die size with strife is just for abilities though, isn't it?

If it works, you get an advantage die, probably because you just knocked the opponent down. Every kind of special move can be handled this way.<br/><br/>However, a zero range left hand attack with a Shield does seem reasonable. It won't be unpenalized, since left hand attacks take a -2. Still, I don't think it will cause any problems if you want to let the player try it out.<br/><br/>Regarding weapons:<br/>The starting weapons that you choose are just that, starting weapons. After the game begins, you can find more weapons and carry them with you. Heroes can lose their weapons, too, like when Poseidon swamps your ship and sends all your belongings to the bottom of the sea.
