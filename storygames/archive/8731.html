I'm GMing Dogs this weekend. I've only done so once before, and it's been awhile, so i wanted to trawl SG's collective brain for the very best online writeups, discussions, one-sheets, and so on for presenting DitV to first-time players. Either advice for me or handouts for them are dandy. I'm particularly looking for good ways to <i>quickly</i> and <i>engagingly</i> communicate the following:<br/><br/>1) The "Setting" basics of the environment, Faithful culture and customs, and the religious hierarchy of Elders and Stewards and Dogs and such.<br/><br/>2) The gist of the Faith itself, <i>particularly</i> the Dogs and their Players' role in interpreting and judging.<br/><br/>3) The metagame conceits of the game such as group consensus of setting details (but respecting GM authority over Town Prep), actively revealing the Town, Roll or Say Yes, the Supernatural Dial, and the role of Player Judgment.<br/><br/>I'm looking for perspective on presenting these topics without seeming off-putting to folks not used to this play mode, and without overselling ("It's all about your judgment as a <i>player.</i>" "Oh, so in this game you play out of character.") <i>OR</i> underselling ("You play religious zealots with <i>this</i> code of Doctrine." "Oh, so here's a list of rules for good roleplaying.") the game's innovation and particular paradigm. Also without using phrases like "particular paradigm." I've had mixed results in the past. Help me out!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193173/#Comment_193173" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T19:28:50+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  7:28PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked how I heard Vincent describe it at this past Gen Con.<br/><br/>"It is about these kids who are told to go into their communities and solve serious problems and the tools they are given to solve the community's problems are a book and a gun."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193174/#Comment_193174" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T19:29:36+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  7:29PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that it's generally best NOT to discuss the things you list in number 3.  It's a good idea to go over the setting basics you list in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  In particular explain the Dog's job of fixing problems in the town.<br/><br/>At some relevant part of play you might want to explain the elements of Ceremony and point out that their "special effects" can be as mundane or flashy as they want.  As the GM I usually take a leadership role on the supernatural dial by simply introducing stuff into play, and players generally "match" my level of supernatural weirdness (which, for me, is admittedly high).<br/><br/>If you do start getting of that, "Ah, so we're evil religious bigots" vibe I generally point out the part of the text where it explains that "The King of Life is a Pragmatist."  That way there's no player/character confusion over the judgment issue.  Just be clear that *any* way they choose to resolve the town's problems is "acceptable play" or "good" role-playing.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193191/#Comment_193191" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T03:18:37+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  3:18AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27503.0" rel="nofollow">This is a good thread,</a> that has links to the pullouts and some character creation handouts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I've done that seems to help new players is, on a blank piece of paper, I draw a circle.

But, if it helps, let's assume that what the Dogs believe in is true and that it is not a game about dogmatic bastards." Once the idea that you are not playing a total asshole is out of the way, most people approach the games with gusto. Ironically, some people go and make an asshole anyway, and I think that is part of the fun.<br/>\n  Also, I think if you play the Initiation by the book, it shows the players a lot of the "metagame conceits" with out getting in their face about how cool and "indie" the game is.<br/>\n  As far as getting the setting details across to the players, I generally try and describe them as we go. Rather than get it all out in front. It generally goes a lot better with context anyways.<br/>\n  I hope that answers your questions. good luck on your game!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193696/#Comment_193696" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T11:28:07+00:00" title="February 23, 2009 11:28AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2009 11:29AM by J_Walton.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had the best luck playing and talking about Dogs in the Vineyard with folks who have an appreciation for the complexity of life in a religious community and don't assume that Dogs are deluded bigoted zealots. Often this requires growing up in or having some other experience with a religious community that was supporting as well as frustrating, welcoming as well as condemning. I imagine most contemporary pagan* communities (or, hell, larp or tabletop communities) have many of those same traits, so it's not specifically limited to those with a background in Christianity (though I suspect that helps one invent appropriate language and rituals more easily).<br/><br/>You know how play of <i>carry: a game about war</i> begins with everyone talking about their experiences with war and soldiers?  I think play of Dogs could probably benefit from starting with a conversation about religion and players' experiences of it, though that may be hard for some folks, especially for a one-shot or convention game.  But if I was starting a campaign of Dogs, that's definitely what I'd begin with.<br/><br/>* I mean in the self-identified-as-pagan sense, not in the everybody-who's-not-Christian sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193698/#Comment_193698" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T11:35:42+00:00" title="February 23, 2009 11:35AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good suggestions, Jonathan.

If you don't have any experience being in a religious community, you might have to find some comparable experience to fall back on (It's like being in Girl Scouts!

When we sat down after our last game, the main group GM didn't say, "so what game do we all want to play next?", but rather "What kinds of settings do you guys like to play in?". I balked a bit, and had to explain my POV: "Well, I'm interested in <i>this game</i> because of <i>this</i>, and <i>that game</i> because of <i>that</i>..." etc.<br/><br/>It definitely is about where people are coming from in their RP experience.<br/><br/>Dave, thanks for your suggestions, and Vincent, thanks too.

In the end, we realized it just wouldn't work, and so the one guy who couldn't hack the Western + pseudo-Mormonism theme (he grew up in Utah and no longer talks to his Mormon family), decided not to play, and myself and the other player got down to business fairly quickly, made up characters, and played through our initial conflict.<br/><br/>I am fairly new to gaming, though I've had the Dogs book for nearly a year now, read it twice, read a lot about it online. I was worried that I had built it up so much in my mind, and had in fact built up RPGs so much in my mind, that I didn't actually like them that much and/or would be disappointed when I actually played.

I have a ladle too.  If I were running a DitV parlor LARP, that's what I would use for serving food and I would serve some sort of grilled meat, potatoes, and homemade bread.  I've only played DitV once and it was awesome (at GenCon Indy last year, with Malcolm Craig running it after hours).  I didn't really get a Mormon vibe at all: we were more like do-gooders with giant ethical decisions and a gun and a book, like Judd/Vincent said.  We were up against people who were a lot more powerful than us and we had to outwit them and take a morally high ground.
