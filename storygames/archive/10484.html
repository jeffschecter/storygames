My weapon of choice was the growling chainsword that is 3:16.<br/><br/>I'll say this right off the bat, I love this game.  It filled the Space-Marines-Exploding-Things-But-Also-Band-of-Brothers niche that I have always been seeking to fill.  So, I rolled up a planet of terrible cultists under thrall of a space-egg full of evil monsters and set my Troopers against it.<br/><br/>Our party included Trooper Jordyn "Blenz" Chase (hot-headed maybe-lesbian), Trooper Jack "Blazer" Mahoney (showstopper patriotism poster-boy), Trooper ... umm, actually I can't remember his name because everyone kept calling him different things.  Martinez, Santiago, Poncho, Valdez but mostly just Sanchez.  He was a chain-smoking badass from Peru.  So, peruvian.  Not mexican.  Apparently we're easily confused.<br/><br/>The group was led by the dumb-as-bricks Corporal Frank (who referred to himself as "Frank the Freedom Fighter") and their scheming Sergeant, Machus.  <br/><br/>Quick story overview - they crash-landed on the planet and were swarmed, fought off some cultists and managed to survive without being too badly beaten.  Following encounters were a solo between a sniper nest and Trooper Ramirez, a mortar attack on the Troopers' overnight hideout, a very short battle with the "blasphemy wagon" and a last-ditch battle with the hatched meteor-egg.  It was chaos and bloodshed and awesome.<br/><br/>Outside the game, I think that it took a few mechanics attempts to get everything sorted out but there weren't any of those awkward stalls where people flip through the book.  Everyone took to the Troopers-vs-but-on-a-team-with-Officers.  A lot of this came from Machus' player being a sneaky fucker.  Once people got the range concept in their head, we had a lot of fun with all the players trying to optimize their own kill and steal kills from each other.<br/><br/>Strengths and Weaknesses came into play pretty marvellously, too.  Blazer single-handedly wiped out the only vehicle encounter with his "Perfect Spiral" Strength, hurling a grenade through the windshield.  BAM.  Their Sergeant bitched out at the start of a big scary encounter just because he "really just isn't here to die".  <br/><br/>The players were all really happy and I got a ton of "let's play again!" before we moved on to other games.  All in all, super fun.  I felt a little odd about framing everything with these obvious "WE ARE PLAYING" board encounters vs. "WE ARE NOT REALLY PLAYING" sort of feeling in-between stuff, but I think that with a longer game, the players would get comfortable with their Troopers and their inter-relationships.  <br/><br/>Gregor, thank you.  I have already gotten my $20 of fun out of the game.  Is there anything anyone wants to know about the game or the session?  I'd be happy to answer questions!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232941/#Comment_232941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T05:25:11+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  5:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like the "basic" 3:16 game then you will love the new Spotlight rules in the upcoming AD 316 game. <br/>\n<br/>\nLittle hint.... the GM also get his Spotlight scene....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
