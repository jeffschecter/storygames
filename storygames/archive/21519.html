I can only assume it is to make vampires more cuddly and human. It is harder to portray a sexy teenage vampire character who is really a predator viewing humans as nothing more than walking snacks (that's surely the ghoul's role...). <br/><br/>From what I read in the rulebook, vampires in Monsterhearts don't actually need to feed on blood at all. Unless they take 'The Feeding' then there is no explicit requirement for a PC vampire to drink the red stuff. Monsterhearts vampires feed on power and manipulation. Your own version may vary, of course.<br/><br/>My own default for RPG vampires is the Nosferatu version, monsters rather than suave or sexy. This might be an unconscious reaction to modern literary depictions versus the original tales, but it might also be because I love the old 1922 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC6jFoYm3xs" rel="nofollow">Nosferatu</a> film. Of course, the Monsterhearts Vampire skin is primarily based on the modern literature and being 'beauty eternal' really doesn't fit the Nosferatu image (unless you have very unconventional tastes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470627/#Comment_470627" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T18:37:18+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  6:37PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love <i>Nosferatu</i>. What a fantastic piece of work.<br/><br/>As for <i>Monsterhearts</i> vampires, the answer is that it has been left deliberately undefined, so the player can bring in their own vision of the vampire. Manipulation of others is definitely the core of the playbook here, but a need to feed and a monstrous disposition are definitely possible - it's up to the player. If you're MCing, do ask them about it, and use their answers. Maybe the want to be a monstrous vampire... and maybe they want to be the 21st-century sparkly kind (oh boy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470631/#Comment_470631" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T19:20:37+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  7:20PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2018 7:22PM by Sadurian.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, I'd love to see a game where the vampire is a Nosferatu-style monstrosity. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cdn1.sciencefiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nosferatu-featured.png"/><br/><br/>Can you imagine the reactions of the other players (never mind the PCs) when the vampire scurries up and tries to seduce them.

Other vampires gleefully generate their own drama that has nothing to do with feeding requirements, and so an idle "oh, hey, do you even eat human food? do you disguise blood by sticking it inside soda cans, or what's up?" question tossed into the session is going to be all you need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470667/#Comment_470667" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-14T22:15:35+00:00" title="March 14, 2018 10:15PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vampire diet should also fit the constraints of the game setting, which in <i>Monsterhearts</i> is usually complex, detailed and specific. <br/>Is there a supply of people who can be killed wihout consequences? What about animals? <br/>For the option of nonlethal feeding, what sort of freaks, if any, submit themselves to a vampire's appetites? Are there enough of them? How can they be found and managed?<br/>Access to an hospital blood bank or the like is trivially easy (and thus too boring to be roleplayed), an annoyance of daily life that can occasionally develop into an interesting situation or episode, a rather major "adventure" and transgression (like a robbery) or implausible and unlikely?<br/><br/>On the other hand some solutions are going to require only a handful of special NPCs without much context. An excellent example: in later novels Anne Rice's recurring cool vampire Lestat progresses from killing bad people to feeding on the period of his nun friend.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
