                    Hello! Long time lurker, first-time poster...<br/><br/>I had a question about some comments on another thread and didn’t want to derail it, so I’m starting a new thread.<br/><br/>Here are some quotes from the  the “Trad Reformation” thread:<br/><br/><b><i>For me, the third option (OSR [and proto-OSR like the Knights of the Dinner Table] and Story Now games being the two other ones) has been neo-trad games a la Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark.</i></b><br/><br/>and<br/><br/><b><i>Although I think the “neo-trad” games (like Apocalypse World, Blades in the Dark, maybe FATE, and others) seem to be mostly derived from the story game tradition, curving back towards traditional play rather than the other way around. </i></b><br/><br/><br/>This something I’ve seen said on this forum a few times, which is that games like Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark aren’t “Story Now” games, but something more traditional (or Neo-traditional).<br/><br/>So I guess I don’t understand what counts as “Story Now”. I’ve read Ron Edwards essays, I’ve lurked on forums, and from how I understand it, Story Now is a style/agenda/whatever in which:<br/><br/>A.) The main goal of play is to create an meaningful narrative that at least approaches what could be considered a “good story” (i.e. Characters do something and are changed by the experience, there is some kind of premise addressed, and the structure at least of sort resembles a traditional story with rising action/climax/denouement, and there is a satisfying conclusion of some sort, with “meaningful”, “premise” and “satisfying” being highly subjective terms.)<br/><br/>B.) The story created is in no way prewritten or controlled by one member of the play group. Player decisions control where the story goes, and there is no foregone conclusion or expectations of moving towards a particular outcome. You “PLAY TO FIND OUT”. It is shared creation of the narrative that happens organically.<br/><br/>C.) Decisions made (in play and in design) prioritize story-creation (as described in A.) over the immersion in/exploration of the shared imaginary world (Simulationism/The Right to Dream) or the overcoming of challenges by the players (Gamism/Step On Up).<br/><br/>So when I run a PbtA game, for instance <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/271947/Tales-of-the-Obsidian-Idol" rel="nofollow">my own fantasy hack</a> (SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION!), I think it conforms to the above. The narrative is improvised on the spot, based on the characters’ starting premisses and driven by their decisions, and the mechanics are designed around pushing the story forward (altering the narrative in one interesting/meaniful direction or the other) rather than “balance” or “verisimilitude”. <br/><br/>I find this to be true of most PbtA games, Fate, and Blades in the Dark... or I think I do?<br/><br/>( I’ve seen some criticism of Dungeon World on this front that it “doesn’t do PbtA right”, but in this case let’s leave that for another discussion and take PbtA to mean games like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Masks - games I think most would agree “get” PbtA.)<br/><br/>So, what am I not seeing?<br/><br/>Am I wrong about what Story Now means?<br/><br/>If not, how do the games mentioned not qualify?<br/><br/>What games out there do qualify as Story Now? (And how are they different?)<br/> </div>

                            Story Now, as originally constructed, means a game in which <i>the players </i>make a <i>moral statement </i>through play.  They "address the premise" in a very narrow sense of premise established by Lajos Egri.  So while you could do (say) an Apocalypse World Story Now game in which play is centered around a moral premise and the play of the characters addresses that premise, certainly you don't have to.                         </div>

                            Thanks!<br/><br/>So what are some games that address a moral premise, and what rules do they use to ensure that this happens? Or is it a function of the mechanics at all? Is it all in the subject matter the group chooses to explore and independent of mechanics?<br/><br/>Also, (and I realize I'm opening a gigantic can of worms) if there is a whole subset of games whose mechanics are generally aimed at the creation of story instead of providing challenge or simulating physics/genre conceits, (which would be Neo-Trad), and within that group of games some focus on addressing a moral premise, as opposed to the rest that address premises like "Can we save the princess? Who will control the throne? How the war affect the kingdom," etc. Then why is Story Now not just a subset of Neo-Trad games and instead it's own category?<br/><br/>It seems like (to make a music analogy) dividing popular music into Rap, Country, Pop, Rock, and Late 70's Prog Rock. One of those seems like it's obviously just a specific subset of another category? <br/><br/>Or is there something (besides the type of question being answered by the story) that sets Story Now further apart from other story-based games?<br/><br/>Or do I just not like these categories?<br/><br/> </div>

My book case, an Expedit (got the last batch before they switched over to Kallax) has shelves that are around 12 inches wide. I have five such shelves available for records.<br/><br/>All the hip hop obv goes in one (Wu-Tang clan ain't nothing to mess around with! Dead Prez, Super Saïan Crew etc), The second one is for country, First Aid Kit and of course my precious Emmylou collection and those American Recordings by Cash. The third one is for pop, sure, Bangles, Madonna… All the SAW stuff like Bananarama (A Linn my favorite drummer). Then I have two shelves left for rock. Need to put my Opeth and my Grateful Dead and my Ebba Grön and my Crass and my Sisters of Mercy and my Wolves of the Throne Room in there. At first I just split the rock collection up in two halves; had it sorted alphabetically and A-O in one shelf and P-Z in the other. But <i>theeen</i> it dawned on me that if I looked specifically at all the ELO (God I love that <i>Time</i> record so much), Supertramp (so so so so logical), Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons Project, Van Halen etc etc etc post-1976 prog-inspired subset of rock—<i>there was enough of it to fill an entire shelf!</i> The other rock stuff I had was so eclectic, there was no rhyme or reason to it.<br/><br/>Long story short genres become genres because Apocalypse World was a massive hit and spawned many derivatives.                        </div>

                            For me it looks like the Story Now type of games has evolved a lot since Forge days. There's <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134196/Chuubos-Marvelous-WishGranting-Engine" rel="nofollow">Chuubo's marvelous wish-granting engine</a> for example, where (correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't played the game) players decide how the story will evolve before playing a scene, so there are no surprise twists while players are roleplaying their characters. Instead they are trying to build up drama around the scene premise discussed until the twist appears in a more natural way. <br/><br/>The game also incentivizes players to introduce short scenes of their characters interacting with the world in simple but meaningful ways, to show characters change or growth. <br/><br/>This is so different from PbtA and so far from old trad games that it makes sense to call PbtA Neo-trad, yet Chuubo is still too close to roleplaying to not call it an RPG.                        </div>

                            The terminology itself is rather arbitrary. For the record, I would never call something like AW a "neo-trad" game myself, despite using the term in my own rpg history writing; I reserve that term for games that are fundamentally traditional while distinguishing themselves from earlier stages of the tradition by adopting minor ideas and influence from progressive design. Generally published by mid-size houses like FFG, Mongoose and such. AW is in cultural history terms a straightforwardly Forgite indie game in comparison. You might as well call <i>Sorcerer</i> a "neo-trad" game. The argument for AW being trad basically amounts to it having character classes and a GM, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is rather clearly a narrativist game, which maybe makes it a "Story Now" game as well? As people enmeshed in the PbtA movement should know, the "PbtA" label in itself doesn't mean much, so there's no guarantee that any given game under that rubric is also "Story Now" or "narrativist", but for AW itself I don't see any controversy - insofar as rpg theory <i>even is a thing</i>, such that any analytical claims can be made, AW is as narrativist or Story Now as just about any game you'd care to name.<br/><br/>That said, Jason is of course right in saying that you don't have to play AW - or any other game - in a narrativist way. Games are only "Story Now" in the sense that they support and harmonize with the intent to play them in that way, not in a mandatory sense where it would be impossible to do something else with the game instead.<br/><br/>In general, though, I would suggest that juxtaposition between an analytical theory term like "Story Now" and a cultural history concept like "neo-trad" will probably only get confusing if you insist on treating them like somehow equivalent categories.<br/><br/>The fact that "Story Now" is something of a marketing label that Ron coined for his own narrativist game design doesn't help the confusion. You could understand is as strictly a synonym of "narrativism" in the Big Model sense, or you could understand it to mean "the particular kind of narrativist game that Ron Edwards makes", and I frankly don't know which way you should go. Is <i>Prince Valiant</i> a "Story Now" game?<br/><br/>In the end it's just a stupid terminology squabble. Probably not worth worrying over unless you're doing marketing and need to establish cultural context.                        </div>

It just won a lot of trad heads over and scratched their trad itch in a way that Fiasco and Montsegur had never done.

More than Sorcerer which is just a plain old trad 90s game with hubris. Sort on the same shelf as Wraith the Oblivion.<br/><br/>Real story now games are more in the vein of Psychodrame, Durance, Svart av kval vit av lust etc.

5e isn't neo-trad. <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>, we have been using the phrase neo-trad for AW &amp; ilk over on <a href="http://rollspel.nu/" rel="nofollow">WRNU</a> for many years now. 5e is closer to OSR games like LotFP and, uh, what's the other one everyone likes?<br/><br/> </div>

                            Here I am, your friendly neighborhood anarchist, reminding you that categories do not exist and objects in the world owe no fealty to any reductionist schema.  To put it in philosophical terms: there are no Pure Forms, and objects are differentiated by exhibiting their own unique combinations of Qualia.  But further: that these qualia do not adhere to any particular scale, field, or schema among themselves.  Worse than comparing apples and oranges, this is more like comparing apples and flying.<br/><br/>Thus, the approach taken to the classification of complex systems should be more molecular than categorical.  There will always be multiple axes along which to parse these objects, many of which not be reliably mappable to the qualia of other objects in the sample.  The resulting taxonomy will resemble a multi-dimensional collection of "tags" (which themselves will exhibit a lot of gapping and overlapping along different dimensions), and will still fail to define a universal and contiguous spectrum.<br/><br/>And from a creative standpoint, that's good news.                        </div>

On second thought I think those jeep games and Danish larps and Montsegur or Fiasco style games have several things in common with the Rails corner even though there's no DM. It's all about that pre-written "story frame". Something AW manages to dodge.                        </div>

                            I don’t like the impronitfol category very much but that’s because while I like ‘story now’ play, I think making decisions on the basis of what creates a good story is vague and tends to be lame. I want to make decisions that are in the best interests of my character, the countervailing force is if my character would make that decision given the situation. Put another way, me and my character can disagree about what their best interests are.<br/><br/>In practice this means I tend to prefer games that hew a bit more closely to the trad model.

                            Neurotrash, you're right about Story Now except for (C) in your OP. The main distinction between the RGFA Threefold and the Forge's Creative Agenda (i.e., GNS) is that where the Threefold imagined Gamism, Dramatism, and Simulationism to be describing priorities for individual decision-making at given moments of play, the Big Model strictly speaking saw GNS as serving as a communal (group level) orientation to the game over longer arcs of play or "reward cycles." So an orientation toward Story Now didn't mean that individuals made decisions based on what was "good for the story"; rather, it meant what generated the most payoff or satisfaction for the group as a group was the sense that the arc of play as a whole was <i>meaningful</i>--versus faithful to its source (Right to Dream), versus challenging to its players (Step On Up). A group's Creative Agenda doesn't have to be all-encompassing; it just has to emerge as an overarching orientation toward the game.<br/> </div>

I’ll give an example.<br/><br/>Me and my character could disagree. Like if my characters a heroin addict who thinks confronting his past is a stupid idea, but I think he should get clean and face his demons, then me and my character have conflicting ideas of what is in his best interest.<br/><br/>In terms of making actual game decisions, then it’s the characters best interest (shoot heroin) that holds the most weight.                        </div>

<blockquote>It just won a lot of trad heads over and scratched their trad itch in a way that Fiasco and Montsegur had never done</blockquote>
But reception of a game, a priori, means nothing about how's the game designed. I'd rather analyze it's own rules, than that. But besides, how could we fit Burning wheel of even The Shadow of Yesterday into "Story now" if all of a sudden AW is Neo-trad? Both BW and TSoY are a lot more trad, to my perception, than AW.<br/><br/>I think the comparison isn't appropriate, because "story now" belongs to a theory. You could have a story now game that's fairly traditional in it's feel (like BW), or you could do it with a GMless game (like, idk, Polaris?).<br/><br/>Not even "Story Game" is a precise term to classify games, but I'd rather use an umbrella term like it, than mess with theory concepts.                        </div>

                            AW is definitely Story-Now-supporting (aka "narrativism!"). However, contrast it with something like My Life With Master or Fiasco or Polaris or Primetime Adventures. All those other four games have a lot of explicit structuring around scenes, scene framing, who has authority when, etc. And those rules are necessary to the way those games go about supporting Story Now play.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird, Burning Wheel, Shadow of Yesterday, Riddle of Steel, and a whole other strand of games don't necessarily mess with the GMing authority structure, but have whole economies based on character flags. Flags are basically things on the character sheet that tell the rest of the play group, but especially the GM, what the player is interested in exploring regarding that character.<br/><br/>So, AW doesn't just "have a GM and character classes." It's also flag-less, has no explicit scene structure, etc., so it doesn't really require players to break actor stance in the way that earlier Forgite games did. That's why neo-trad is a reasonable label for it, though it's certainly very explicit in the text about rejecting certain of the most common aspects of trad play, especially GM fiat.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't love the neo-trad label. I just set out to examine what was happening in RPG design *outside* of indie circles in 2000-2006 or so, and called that the Trad Reformation.                        </div>

                            I'd say it has flags, but it uses subtler techniques for the GM to discover them. Does the game need to adhere to the first wave of technologies developed by story now games, for it to be a story now game too? I don't think so.                        </div>

Right, they need that sweet sweet insp / fate points (not to mention that the good old never a frown isn't an primary motivator in and of itself), but the other stuff you were writing seemed to indicate that you were dissatisfied when there was such dissonance; I guess I misunderstood.

                            I’m with <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> on this one; there are trends and similarities between games that share cultural influences, but ultimately you can make an argument to draw the line almost wherever you wish.<br/><br/>For instance, is Sorcerer the first Story Now/Narrativist/story game? Or is it the last traditional game? (In other words, the least “trad” rpg before we started making the transition into full blown “story games”?)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> explains the reasoning for labeling something like AW “neo-trad” quite well: compared to “story games” of the same time period, it has relatively few obvious markers of a typical “Story Now” game, a traditional GM role, and no explicit directions towards Theme and moral conflict, no explicit scene economy or scene framing rights, etc, etc - and it’s true, I’ve run AW for trad gamers and they don’t “notice” that they’re playing anything different. It’s quite possible to play the game entirely from actor stance, and it has no “pretentious” or “weird” elements (like a Self-Loathing stat or Monologues of Victory).<br/><br/> </div>

                            I dunno! I remember lots of games from the 90s with some kind of “weird” stat, it seems to me. Hx is definitely odd, though! I agree there.<br/><br/>Where are you getting your information about Mutant Year Zero from? I don’t know much about the origins of the game; I’ve only read a bunch of reviews and had several story gamer PbtA fans tell me that they played it and found quite good but a little too traditional for their tastes.                        </div>

                            I know some of the Fria Ligan and Järnringen dorks. The layout guy from Symbaroum played in our Lamentations game for a while. Also his GF played roller derby on the same team as my ex. Two of my other friends work in the event dept for Fria Ligan.<br/><br/>PbtA and BW are just games that the Fria Ligan folks are very familiar with; maybe BW/MG more so than PbtA. However, ofc them being familiar with a game doesn't dictate to what extent they let that familiarity influence them. I'm not the biggest expert on MY0 myself so if folx wanna jump in here and correct me.                        </div>

                            I think, ideally, that it's both.

Gotcha. This is an interesting POV that I'm gonna want to think some more about &amp; mull over for a few hours.<br/><br/>The history of fate points being a way to solve the problem of never really knowing exactly <i>how much</i> a specific GURPS flaw was worth because you didn't know how often it would come up in play; fate points give you the "payment" for the flaw as it comes up. Also anytime I can add some mechanics to that sweet texture-like-sun I'm up for it man this thread is really really making me want to use ⚞slaps self⚟ snap out of it twenty!                        </div>

I disagree with the implication that in-game rewards are external rewards.<br/><br/>External reward:<br/>Giving $5 to the player who played the most tragic character.<br/>The player whose character kills the most monsters gets to choose the next game we play after this campaign.<br/><br/>In-game rewards:<br/>You get 1 Loot per Monster you Kill.<br/>You gain 1 Influence at the end of the session if your character advanced in station.<br/>You get a Fate point when your aspect makes trouble for you.<br/>You get a Persona point if your character accomplished their goal.                        </div>

That’s my fear.<br/><br/>So "Whenever you choose to engage in your addiction in a situation that puts you or your allies in danger, you earn a fate point."?<br/><br/>Is fine in theory. In practice the mechanical reward can displace the agenda reward. I don’t think it has to, but it often does, and so you need a really compelling reason to include mechanics that incentivize behavior.                         </div>

                            Here to remind you all that the actual point of handing out Fate points or whatever for engaging in your character flaws, or pursuing your character's goals, isn't actually "rewards" but just as a tool for communication. Flag-less games often suck due to aimlessness.                        </div>

                            If you are rewarded in-game ... that is, IN the actual fiction ... for something, then it's an intrinsic reward. So if you like to act in character, the reward should be more opportunities to act in character, not a +1 to your skill roll or a point to spend later. Giving that kind of extrinsic reward does either nothing, or CAN <i>decrease</i> the excitement for acting in character. Not everyone sees the reward as a tool of communication; they actually see the reward ... as a reward separated from the act, and when they start to try to earn the reward instead of enjoying the act in the first place, the intrinsic reward for doing it decreases. <br/><br/>The two exceptions of when extrinsic rewards influencing the intrinsic rewards negatively, and instead can affect the person's intrinsic reward <i>positively</i>:<br/>• If the reward is a social one. Like, "I notice you". Likes in Facebook are extremely powerful.<br/>• If the reward is part of a competition. Like, a combat.<br/>• The task is boring to begin with.<br/><br/>People need to understand this, instead of just designing with rewards in mind because that's what a really successful roleplaying game has been doing for forty years. Where the designers who is designing rewards in the same matter haven't realized that that the said popular game's reward system is successful because the whole game is – in its mechanical design – about competition.                        </div>

                            Ya'll, an intrinsic motivation means something very specific in the psych literature. Intrinsic rewards are internal to a single person's psyche. Satisfaction from a job well done. The joy of learning something new. The sense of belonging that comes from interacting with friends and community.<br/><br/>The GM giving Alice a fate point is very, very, very, very much not intrinsic to Alice. You wanna say otherwise, you're making up a new definition for "intrinsic" and attaching it to a word with an established meaning, in a rather confusing way.<br/><br/>The full story on extrinsic reward / intrinsic motivation is indeed a lot more complicated than "X destroys Y," and it's much more subtle than "americans vs other folks." The nature of the interaction is more mediated by a person's internal framework for motivation, and whether external rewards are seen as affirming internal choices or imposing external constraints. (Note that a single reward framework can usually be viewed both ways, depending on mindset.)<br/><br/>But the fact is, the interaction between extrinsic reward and intrinsic motivation is A Thing. A Complicated Thing. "My game gives points that encourage behavior Foo" is often completely insufficient to actually encourage behavior Foo; for at least some people, it will actively discourage behavior Foo.<br/><br/>Here's two mechanics:<br/><br/>Every time a player is forced to make a hard bargain or ugly choice, give them Inspiration.<br/><br/>When the players turn to you to see what happens next, give them a hard bargain or ugly choice.<br/><br/>How are they similar? How are they different?                        </div>

                            When it comes to <b>Apocalypse World</b>, my point of view is that the game is trad, but seen from a different perspective.<br/><br/>When we used neo-trad over at wrnu - the largest online Swedish roleplaying game community that spawned a lot of RPG theory, it was mostly in the sense of "traditional games that borrowed stuff from The Forge" or "traditional games with a large amount of player influence". <b>Feng Shui, Mutant: Year Zero</b>, and <b>Over the Edge</b> are some examples.<br/><br/>We stopped using neo-trad on wrnu, however, because most Swedish games produced are neo-trad. It's possible that <b>Trudvang</b> is still traditional, and I say that because I know how the creators are, but that game would then be in a minority.                        </div>

                            Apocalypse World is a rock-solid, absolutely traditional game in every way except one tiny part of one tiny move (I'll let you try to find it.)  In Apocalypse World, you say what you're doing and the GM says what happens. Sometimes the GM tells you to roll a thing and you roll and the GM looks at the result and tells you what happens. <br/><br/>And the ratiocination around whether a fate point is really "internal" or "external"....like....come on. The entire character is external to you. All fate points are is recognition that the narrative, having tormented you for your failings, may reward you for your strengths. It's a focusing mechanic - nothing more. And it only, only, only makes sense in pulp settings.  (Not fedoras-and-Nazis pulp; actual pulp novellas, the literary form.)                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>, I’d love to hear why you think that AW is clearly a Narrativist game. (For what it’s worth, I don’t disagree at all, but I find the design fairly subtle about in a number of important respects, and the book isn’t explicit about any kind of theme-hunting or moral choices in the way that, say, Sorcerer is. Traditional gamers seem to pick up AW and “recognize it as one of their own”, instead of squinting at it as a foreign entity built by swine. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )                        </div>

                            As for explicit rewards for roleplaying actions, I think that a) extrinsic rewards do affect our decisions over time (and can diminish intrinsic motivation) and b) a well-designed game with reward cycles clearly works to create satisfying and consistently fun play. I don’t think those are as contradictory as they seem; perhaps it’s a simple matter of subject, scale, and feedback giving rather different results than the original experiments that showed this effect.<br/><br/>I’ve seen “extrinsic rewards” both succeed and fail in this respect when it comes to gaming; I’m not yet sure whether the difference is always design, culture of play, or personal preference. I’m not a fan of “let’s vote for the best player award!” mechanics, for instance, and tend to disengage from those; on the other hand, anyone who thinks that XP awards don’t drive play in D&amp;D has a steep hill to climb to convince me of their position.                        </div>

                            I think it has something to do with the overly “extrinsic” nature of the award, actually. It seems totally unrelated to the fun of the game, and there is often no objective criteria for it, which makes it further socially uncomfortable. But the former is a bigger deal to me; it just seems totally disconnected from the game we’re playing and the enjoyment of it. I’m sure there is a game out there where it’s just the right thing (especially games where entertaining each other is the point, perhaps), but a democratic vote among a very small group and entirely unclear criteria just doesn’t seem to me to add anything to the game. At least, I can’t remember any instance of playing a game where such a mechanic felt like it improved the game for me. <br/><br/>I’m open to alternate experiences; perhaps I just haven’t played the right games yet, or with the right people! <br/><br/>The general sense, though, is of total disconnection from the actual activity at the table. I feel the same about “GM XP awards”; I can’t particularly see how they improve the experience at the table. In comparison, many XP award mechanics that are based on *things happening in the game* - that feed back into fictional or mechanical choices being made - are exciting and effective. Getting 500 XP for braving a death trap but being clever enough to escape with the gold, that’s fun. Getting awarded 500 XP because the other players staked those points on anyone betraying the Duke... equally fun. And so on.<br/><br/>If you’re really curious, I’d encourage you to start a new thread! You might get some varying viewpoints and opinions. Would be interesting! Otherwise it will just be a distraction in this one.                        </div>

So getting 5000XP or 500000XP is more fun then? Why is 500XP more fun than 5XP or 0XP ... or feeling clever for escaping with the gold?                        </div>

                            Those are good questions. I think that the real reward here is mainly social, but, also, in part because of the way the XP feeds back into future play (by giving your character greater or different abilities, which allows you to pursue greater challenges in the future).<br/><br/>The key, I think, is that the group has already established the value of a particular challenge (in this case, finding gold in death traps, let’s say), and thereby challenged the player to attempt something risky. When the player steps up to the challenge and carries it off, the XP reward is a way to communicate achievement on the social level, as well. <br/><br/>So, if there was a sense that there was no real risk involved, the power of the reward would vanish. If there was a sense that it was arbitrary - or given after the fact, without expectations being established beforehand - the reward would also lack meaning and serve, at best, as a very weak incentive. If there was a sense that 5000 XP wasn’t legitimately ten times more dangerous or risky or time-consuming, then there wouldn’t be any real difference between 500 and 5000. That would be another failure case. (As a sidenote, the ability to distinguish quantity this way is the only reason to have points in the first place; otherwise it would almost certainly be preferable to go directly to the actual award, whether it be social recognition, opening up new possible adventures, or whatever else.)<br/><br/>I think that the points and the numbers only work and mean something when the players have all agreed to consistently connect them to real in-game events. <br/><br/>I can easily imagine a player saying, for example, that they felt the challenge was too easy, and therefore they decline the award. The points mean nothing by themselves, in other words, but are a signaling mechanism for risk, challenge, success, courage, smarts, and social reinforcement. <br/><br/>Something like that - this is not a matter I’ve given great thought. <br/><br/>This is why “vote for the best player” type mechanics don’t seem to carry much meaningful weight, to me. Perhaps in a game where the players went in knowing what their objective was (“deliver the greatest blow/most significant obstacle to our enemies”), it might work. We could have a meaningful discussion about what was the most effective maneuver, idea, or strategic success, and that would feed back into future play.                        </div>

                            No no <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> The 500XP are an affordance marker. "It's just a bet between friends." kind of excuse, only not for annoying anybody, but to enhance the fun. To me, Fate points always meant "if you punch the Duke in the face, you won't die right away." It's an opportunity to drop a flashlight. Of course, you don't need it. But it helps. It makes you consider the fact. It throws a certain light on a situation. Contrary to Paul_T I would say that a 0XP award would work the same. That's very personal I believe.                         </div>

                            I actually don’t think that’s contrary to what I’m saying. If in our game the 0XP reward and the 500XP aren’t meaningfully different, that’s our failure as players to assign them to appropriate challenges - in that case we should probably get rid of quantified XPs altogether, since they aren’t serving a function. <br/><br/>The real reward is social, and the points are just a way of marking that; however, they also form the important function of changing how we play the game. (New character abilities transform the form the next adventure takes, or give us access to a new area of the world, perhaps.) If instead of points we get to write the character’s name on the wall, instead, that’s just as good or better; but the important part is that a) we feel that it correlates to some real sense of challenge and risk, and b) it feeds back into the game, transforming it in some way. Otherwise, the actual reward we’re using to flag that (whether points or a sign on the wall or a vote) is pretty much useless.                        </div>

(For what it’s worth, I don’t disagree at all, but I find the design fairly subtle about in a number of important respects, and the book isn’t explicit about any kind of theme-hunting or moral choices in the way that, say, Sorcerer is. Traditional gamers seem to pick up AW and “recognize it as one of their own”, instead of squinting at it as a foreign entity built by swine. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )</p></div></blockquote>
There is no inherent reason why a game couldn't be both narrativist and recognizable to trad gamers at the same time. They're perpendicular properties independent of each other. Specifically, being narrativist doesn't require you to have strange rules; well-crafted trad rules can work just fine, depending on what exactly you're trying to do.<br/><br/>AW is clearly narrativist because the most natural read of what it's about on the immediate level is "how does your character slot into the post-apocalyptic landscape as a person performing a social role", and on the wider campaign level "what happened to the world, and what are we doing about it now". These are literary premise questions, the precise sort that defines narrativism. The game doesn't try to answer them in advance, and doesn't encourage any of the players to do so; it merely asks you to play to find out. Couldn't be much clearer about being narrativist.<br/><br/>Whether this qualifies for "story now" or "story game" or "neo-trad" or whatever depends on what you mean by those words, but the narrativism bit is only in question if you read the same game text I did and somehow came to a different conclusion about its subject matter.<br/><br/>And, of course: if somebody plays AW in a non-narrativist way, then that's what they do, and good for them if it works for them. My saying that "game X is narrativist" does not mean here, and cannot possibly mean, anything more than "I think that the natural creative interest in playing this game is a narrativistic one". I could possibly see a Sim read of the game, just barely, even if it doesn't seem nearly as natural as a Nar read does.                        </div>

                            Yeah, 2097, Deliverator and I are all on the same page. Exactly!<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>I don't disagree with any of that! Thanks. I think what makes it potentially "neo-trad" (which is not a term I particularly recognize as meaningful, for the record, depending on who's talking and how they want to define it) is how less overt it is about its play priority. <br/><br/>I remember when it came out that it was a shock to a lot of Forgite gamers. We asked, "where are the character Flags?", and "these rules don't resolve conflicts! Is this task resolution again?", and "where are the reward cycles for addressing premise?", and so on and so forth. Stylistically, it's a bit of a hybrid, including all kinds of things not typically associated with Narrativist story games, like hit points, weapon stats (gun porn), sandbox-like GM prep (as opposed to Kickers and Bangs or defined moral boundaries and escalation - compare to other Narrativist games from the period which usually instruct the GM to "figure out what the players care about and then prepare dilemmas for them and escalate, escalate, escalate! Force them to take a stand on the issue!"), and escalating character powers which increase their stats and damage output.<br/><br/>Clearly, it works as a Narrativist game, but I think it marks a significant departure from game design up to that point, and started quite a new trend (games like <i>Blades in the Dark</i> seem to appeal to traditional gamers in ways that <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Grey Ranks</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, etc, never did). <br/><br/>Even <i>The Riddle of Steel</i> had its Spiritual Attributes, which were a fairly overt "indie/Forge/story game" type of thing. Apocalypse World is remarkable in the way that it has no (or almost no) overt player-facing "premise addressing" stuff at all, and even on the GM side, it's kind of subtle and presented in different language. (For instance, we get "be a fan of the players' characters" instead of "the PCs are the Protagonists of the story; make sure the story is always about them".)<br/><br/>I agree with you (you've said this before, I believe) that AW is sort of a spiritual successor to <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>; although TSoY has more overt "author stance" kind of business in it - especially Keys and BDTP - it has a lot of very traditional elements, from character building (Secrets!) to a traditional GM role.<br/><br/>Back in 2007, John Harper said:<br/><br/>"TSOY has the most beautiful alchemy to it. It straddles the traditional/story-game divide and delivers something so pure and good that it is now the thing I point to when someone asks me what an RPG is."<br/><br/>In 2010, <a href="/forums/profile/jenskot">@jenskot</a> wrote a nice mini-essay on the waves Apocalypse World made on the scene, and how a lot of "indie gamers" were confused by its design (I was one of them!). Although he is very tongue-in-cheek, his "lies" were all based on real people's reactions on the "indie scene" to Vincent's new game:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13081/apocalypse-world-lies/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13081/apocalypse-world-lies/p1</a> </div>

                            To this day, AW is the game I see causing the most performance anxiety among GMs who are considering running a new game.  The hybrid nature of its design is yes, close enough to Trad to make sense on one level, but different enough (read: qualitative and ambiguous enough) to send you running in circles making sure you grok it well enough not to "botch it" and embarrass yourself.  In a way, its lack of <i>utter</i> difference makes it harder to discern its <i>subtler</i> differences.<br/><br/>In part - and I can speak only of edition 1 here since I haven't seen ed 2 - some of this trouble is due to the book's terrible organization.  But that's just a sidepoint, since like most GMs preparing for their first MC performance, I remember reading and rereading and querying and googling for literally *days*, worried that there was some key structural element that I was missing, or that I would take the "wrong" artistic/philosophical stance, in short, that I would fuck it up.  <br/><br/>Of course, with help from Paul and others here and on other forums, I finally did it, and rocked it.  But no other game has ever given me such trepidation.                        </div>
