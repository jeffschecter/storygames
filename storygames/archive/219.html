                    Okay, tried running PTA for the first time last night. And although it didnt entirely explode? I am not convinced it was really a quality beginning. <br/>
<br/>
Our First Session. <br/>
<br/>
Well, we were only able to get 4 hours set aside for the game. Which was already pushing it in my opinion. On top of that buy the time we got there late, got food taken care of. etc. we only had about 2.5 hours. I Decided we would focus solely on series and protagonist creation that night. Seeing as how we would not have time for the pilot anyways. I think this was mistake #1<br/>
<br/>
First let me detail the players. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah 29 Years old. Minored in Art in college. Never RP'd asside from stuff like Diablo. <br/>
<br/>
Billie 25 years old. A few credits shy of a film degree and an aspiring director/script writer. Never RP'd aside from sessions of DnD when she was 12. <br/>
<br/>
Tracy 28 years old. My Girlfriend, a professional artist. I have managed to drag her to a few games of Witchcraft RPG that she claims she enjoyed. <br/>
<br/>
Del 30 years old. This is me, I am the producer. Im a tech geek. <br/>
<br/>
I was very positive about all the creative types we had in our group. <br/>
<br/>
I had emailed a week or 2 earlier with encouragement to come to the table with ideas and if they wanted to start discussing ideas via email. Only one idea was put forth and it was not really "discussed" at all. And although it wasnt a bad idea, it didnt come up at all during our actual session. This did not bode well, but maybe they werent just the "email discussion" types? <br/>
<br/>
Once we were finally sat down at the table. I started off with a brief description of how series creation would go and what the general idea behind PTA is. Then launched straight into "what kind of things do you want". Turns out only one person had really given much thought to this, billie, but she had alot of great ideas. Tracy only shouted out 1 or 2 things. Sarah shouted out a bunch of things but the vast majority of them were silly and/or comedic, making clear where she wanted this to go. Unfortunately Billies stuff was mostly dramatic/dark/bizarre. (shes something of a horror fan)<br/>
<br/>
Heres a mostly complete list of everyones ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah 							<br/>
<br/>
Sarcastic Brunette		<br/>
Religious Sacrifice 			<br/>
(was actually said 		<br/>
in jest, but I kept it)		<br/>
Cannibalistic Bunny Rabbit	<br/>
Recurring Joke		<br/>
<br/>
Billie <br/>
<br/>
Old Silent Film Actress	 <br/>
Hiking/Applachians<br/>
Blues Guy<br/>
Cemetary<br/>
Random Sushi Chef                                                               <br/>
Slutty Mom character<br/>
Brothel/Hotel<br/>
Midget	<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tracy<br/>
<br/>
Supernatural<br/>
Raunchy Sci-Fi<br/>
There may have been a few more that didnt get written down in my notes. But you get the general idea. Most of Sarah's ideas were kinda silly jokey type stuff. Most of Billies were ....not. And Tracy only had 2 suggestions at all. I think this was mistake number 2 because I did not put forth any of my own suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
Then I asked for things that people DIDNT want. Things they didnt think would make interesting storys. <br/>
<br/>
I got <br/>
<br/>
Soap Opera Romance -Tracy<br/>
Babies -Sarah<br/>
No Lawyer/Cop Shows -Tracy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was mistake #3 and #4. I should have encouraged more conversation here. AND I should have thrown in a few of my own. Specifically I should have said "no comedy shows" both because I honestly had little interest in doing a comedy and also because I could tell Sarah wanted a comedy but noone else at the table really did. It would have been better to set this aside early. This led to some tension later. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then we narrowed down our "want list to. We also modified our ideas here a bit. It was understood we still may not use all these elements. <br/>
<br/>
Old Silent Film Actress<br/>
Midget - as minor backround character<br/>
Supernatural-but Subdued<br/>
Religious Sacrifice<br/>
Cemetary-with alot of mysteriously young deaths<br/>
Hitchiking thru the applachians<br/>
Blues Guy as Narrator<br/>
Alcoholic Slut Mom<br/>
Brothel-Something Sinister<br/>
<br/>
There was starting to be a bit of tension at this point. Sarah was obviously getting frustrated that this wasnt seeming to be much of a comedy. Tracy was frustrated because the only idea of hers that got used at all was Supernatural, and even that got marked as "subdued". I am tempted to mark this as mistake # 5 but really it is just a continuation of mistakes I had made before. <br/>
<br/>
Next we tried to nail down "tone". We ended up settling on "dark comedy" which I felt tracy compromised for, but not too grudgingly, and sarah let go because she felt like she had no choice. We agreed to maybe come back to this later. Definitely Mistake #5. I should have insisted on nailing this down. <br/>
<br/>
Now I move to Mistake #6. The question was whats the show "about". I tried explaining that to me shows usually have 2 different things there about. <br/>
<br/>
MASH is about a mobile hospital in the Korean War, but really its about all these people thrown in a horrible situation and trying to survive it thru humor. <br/>
<br/>
Buffy is about a vampire slayer, but really its about the awkwardness of being a teenager and learning to the deal with the world on its terms. <br/>
<br/>
etc. etc. <br/>
<br/>
I dont think I explained this very well, and in any event it may have been a mistake to try and explain it at all. Anyways we got this, after some hard pushing from me. <br/>
<br/>
What the Show is About : Outsiders trapped in a strange town trying to get out. <br/>
<br/>
What the Show is About : .....nothing....we decided we had to make the characters first, and then we never ended up coming back to this. Mistake #6.5?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Characters : <br/>
<br/>
I started with people just throwing out character concepts, and people picking ones. We got the following. I dont remember whos idea was whos<br/>
<br/>
Future Priest<br/>
Geeky Goth Chick<br/>
Med Student<br/>
Foreign Guy<br/>
Stoner<br/>
Video Game Geek<br/>
Sarcastic Brunette<br/>
Loose Girl Looking for Love<br/>
Scary Movie Geek<br/>
Horror Movie Buff<br/>
Quiet Ally Sheedy from Breakfast Club type. <br/>
Tokey Gay<br/>
Jock Chick<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Billie picked Future Priest and morphed it into a leader type wannabe who had religious torment issues and always strived to be logical and levelheaded about things. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah took......Black Gay Jew...yah, that wasnt on the list. This is where things REALLY fell apart I think, she was regressing into doing jokey stuff claiming this concept would be funny and the comic relief character. I am not convinced it will work. <br/>
<br/>
Tracy took Jock Chick at first, then switched to scary movie geek, as in he is a little bit of a creepy guy. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think we tried for a split second to go back to what is the show "REALLY" about, but ended up mostly just adding to "whats the show about" like details and such. <br/>
<br/>
They are 3 ex-college roomates who had been to this town before and "something" had happened. a 4th roomate was there too and has called them back to the town under the threat of revealing whatever it was that happened. Upon arriving in the town noone knows where he is and the protagonists will immediately try to leave town. Circumstances will get in there way. It was decided that this would be a running gag of sorts where outrageous stuff keeps happening to keep them trapped in the town. <br/>
<br/>
I passed out sheets and started with concept. That was easy enough at this point <br/>
<br/>
Billie-Serious Tormented Religious<br/>
Sarah - BlackGayJew<br/>
Tracy - Creepy guy/Film Geek<br/>
<br/>
Edges and connections : <br/>
<br/>
Everyone started getting tired, and in retrospect I think I should have called the night here. As people started getting snippy about here. <br/>
<br/>
I explained edges pretty okay, but they were struggling with connections since they were supposed to be outsiders in the town. We got thru this after some struggling but im not terribly happy with most of it. <br/>
<br/>
Billie/Joshua-Edge Arm Chair Detective Connections-Local Mortician and ex-lover waitress at diner<br/>
<br/>
Sarah/Larry Edge-Dr. in VD clinic and Good with money<br/>
<br/>
Tracy/? Edge-Fast Talker Connection-4th Roomate .....and I dont remember what she is missing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not happy with these really. hmmmmm Mistake #7. Should have been better explained, and maybe put off till next session. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Overall I think alot of mistakes were made, and most of them could have been avoided. I really needed to encourage people to speak up. For example. I could have at some point said. How many people here want a straight comedy? I imagine only sarah would have raised her hand, and she may have been a little more flexible as a result later on. As it was, I dont think it really clicked for her that this wasnt going to be a comedy till long after everyone else did. <br/>

                            I'd talk to them and find out if they're all happy with what came out. If not, cancel the show. See if there's common ground for another. The last thing you want to do is have three or four people slogging through something that isn't really fun for anyone, let alone everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe find a different set of players (you can include some of the ones you have). It seems that you're not all on the same page. There's nothing wrong with any one player's input but you all have to find some common ground. <br/>
<br/>
If you are set on playing with the people you have, maybe PtA isn't the right game right now.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you really need analysis of what went wrong. I think you know what went wrong. Don't beat yourself up for it though. Everyone at the table needs to take responsibility for their compromises and such.                        </div>

Way ahead of you. I have already emailed them with my worries that it didnt go well. Everyone "agreed" to the show but I am not convinced they are really happy with it. Then again, I may be overanalyzing.                        </div>

                            I'd second what Adam said.<br>
<br/>
FWIW, my PTA pitch sessions have worked best when we've started with actual pitches, i.e. "It's a show about a haunted cruise ship - the main characters are the crew and there's a rotating cast of guests: think 'Lost' meets 'The Love Boat'."  We'll toss one out, talk it over, dismiss it, and move onto the next pitch.  After the fourth or fifth try, we're usually on the same wavelength, based on what we've liked about the rejected pitches and on the reasons why we ended up rejected them.  I've had worse luck when we've started by simply listing things we did or did not want to see, without thinking about those things in the context of a specific show idea.  (I know this has worked for other groups, but I find it a lot less organic).                        </br></div>

I really thought this would work well for us. But I am curious how your "show pitch" idea would work in my group. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx for the comments guys. It really is helpful <br/>

                            Don't be so hard on yourself.  It sounds like you have a fabulous group and just need to find the right frequency.  If you have one player fixated on the silly, that's probably a sign of discomfort.  Maybe throw out what you have and pitch something that hits on everybody's interests - make it very light and goofy (and safe), make it supernatural, make it horror-inflected.  Vampire photocopy repairmen!  <br/><br/>Or maybe try something that everybody knows really well.  One time I said "you know what's awesome?  Red Dawn is awesome.  Let's play Red Dawn right now."  And we did, and it was, and nobody had to think too hard to get rolling.                        </div>

<br/>
I do tend to be hard on myself when it comes to running a game. I also tend to overanalyze and look for problems everywhere i go. <br/>
<br/>
I think you hit on something there with the player fixated on silly. My instinct was to have her compromise since she was in the minority, but when it became apparent that she was kinda fixated on it, I should have looked to the other players to compromise. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

The Producer or whatever in PtA is there to facilitate and stuff but if they can't come to a compromise and stick up for the things that are important to them, there's nothing you can do to make it better. But listen to Jason, because he's right, too.                        </div>

This goes against everything I have ever learned about RPG's. Not that your statement isnt wise. Just admitting my own bad habits. ;-)<br/>

                            Second and third what they said. And you're supposed to be able to have fun too!<br/>
<br/>
If you keep this pitch, I wonder if there is some kind of overall schtick that they could all get into, like that the "wierd things" that happen end up being just events from different films they've seen or different film genres.  That way all the wildly disparate ideas people came up with could be incorporated at different times.  One time it could be like they fell into a zombie movie, another time they get caught up in a war against aliens, and they could have a wierd little cannibalistic bunny rabbit side kick that gives them enigmatic hints about what's really going on. <br/>
<br/>
Or is that too crazy?? : ) <br/>
<br/>
But like Jason said, I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for everybody.  Just having more time to talk about it &amp; not being tired will probably work wonders.                        </div>

<br/>
No, not a dismal failure; more likely a stumble. You're talking to people and willing to start anew -- those two things are huge positive signs for a successful game. (As opposed to the traditional "talking about what we're doing, let alone changing it, is a sign of weakness.")<br/>
<br/>
Second thing:<br/>
<br/>
"My instinct was to have her compromise...I should have looked to the other players to compromise."<br/>
<br/>
Compromise? Why? Ideally you want everyone on board instead of one person saying, "nah, not this one" and dropping out -- though even that's hardly the end of the world -- but if you try to satisfy everybody with a compromise nobody likes, you'll just lose everyone sooner or later. Get people to say outright what they like -- and then make it safe to say "no" to things that aren't compatible with each other:<br/>
<br/>
 "Hey, I know you want to do X, but I don't see how it works with Y, and I really, really want Y -- so can you give up on X for this game? C'mon, it's only, what, five sessions."                        </div>

<br/>
not to get stuck on semantics, but isnt that compromising? <br/>
<br/>
I guess I am having a problem because the ONLY ideas sara really seemed interested in were the funny ones. preferably over the top somewhat bizarre style funny  Conversely, at least one of the other players wasnt really interested in straight comedy, "serious funny" would have been ok, but not any show that could really be categorized as "comedy". <br/>
<br/>
In my mind, SOMEONE was going to have to give up some portion of there idea, hence a compromise. The problem is who? and how? <br/>

                            Well, when one set of ideas isn't coming to a satisfying place for everyone, throw it ALL out and start over. If Sara goes right back to comedy and won't budge on that, and the rest of the group really doesn't want to play that, then maybe PtA isn't the game for you that night. Maybe it's a game better to be played on a night that Sara can't make it. Pull out Dogs in the Vineyard or My Life with Master or Sorcerer or D&amp;D or Cyberpunk 2020 and have some fun in a way that makes no one compromise too much.<br/>
<br/>
If you can't find a way for everyone to have fun (and compromise is a valid way, as long as the result is fun), then redefine "everyone" to include a different set of people.                        </div>

                            I'll toss my two cents in with the notion of making a full pitch, instead of trying to build a show out of different parts.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a hospital show, and the PCs are the doctors and staff. In Baghdad. 1991."<br/>
<br/>
"It's bizarro mystery-solving, scooby-doo thing, but we zot into different classic movie genres each week." (damn that's a cool idea, Em)<br/>
<br/>
"It's a moody relationship show, like a darker (but still funny) Gilmore Girls. We're a family in crisis after one of the boys is sent off to Vietnam."<br/>
<br/>
"It's L.A. Confidential... in ancient Rome."<br/>
<br/>
Like that. See if everyone can buy into a mini-show sketch like that. Then, once everyone is leaning forward and all leapord-looks, then you flesh it out.                        </div>

I find that in any group collaboration will get you a long way, but you really need that agreed-upon alpha person as producer to get you the rest of the way. It so happens that the pitch is part of that "rest of the way" even though it's one of the first things that happens.                        </br></br></div>

                            Well. <br>
<br>
I emailed the group about my concerns. The only person who chose to respond is Sara who assured me she is happy with what we have. I will double check with the others but at this point its one of 2 things. <br>
<br>
1. They are unhappy with the show we created but everyones being to "nice" to say anything. <br>
<br>
2. I am overanalyzing and they are perfectly fine with what we have. <br>

                            I have an idea to see if people are ready-- if they're jazzed and you're just misreading them. Try using the "Next Week on..." rules.  If you don't have a solid idea of the setting, etc., that you'd be prepping for, ask them for one scene or scene snippet-- the amount that the they'd contribute to a the next episode.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully their specific suggestions will spark with each other in your mind and soon you'll have a coherent show dancing in your mind.  If that doesn't happen-- say, the snippets couldn't be part of the same show-- then you'll have something specific to discuss.                        </div>
