I thought I was pretty prepared for whatever might come. <br/><br/>For all that, <i>none</i> of us expected the first session to close with outdoor sex while a child was being murdered three feet away. We were shocked, awed... and delighted.<br/><br/>We had adapted the Polaris rules to a different setting, one that we developed together during a month-long <a href="http://wiki.trevismartin.org/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisionistHistory" rel="nofollow">Revisionist History</a> game. The game featured the beginning of a nation and the decline of the fay race who had ruled the land before. When I suggested we play a Polaris game depicting the fall of some of the fay, the others were quickly enthusiastic about the idea. <br/><br/>We made some adaptations to the rules accordingly, mostly in the common Aspects. The PCs are the Beloved of Elehal (the fay race's earth/fertility goddess), dedicated to preserving the earth and the faith, and all have the goddess's crescent seal somewhere on their person. Their songs have the power to ensnare and enthrall, and they all share the fate of fascination with mortals, the race that would eventually eclipse their power.<br/><br/>The final scene of the first session spotlighted my Heart character Pennar Arrowsong. He was trying to get back a human child from his ex-wife Kara, who had enticed the child away to use as a sacrifice to the goddess. My Mistaken narrated how Kara killed the child on the spot, spurting blood everywhere, which I quickly parried with a You Ask Far Too Much. Instead she offered that Kara kissed Pennar, reviving their old love, and I accepted with That Was How It Happened. <br/><br/>I guess I should have been a bit more zealous on Pennar's behalf, at least slip some conditions in there, but we were all--callously enough--kind of waiting for the child to die. The child's father and Pennar's Full Moon character, Xavier, was an important part of our established history from the RH game, an enemy to the fay race and the vanquisher of their faith. That all started with his son's death at the hands of the fay, which we never detailed, so it would be all the more awesome if my character, a fay who had promised protection, betrayed him so badly.<br/><br/>Completely enthralled by his love and her magic, Pennar fell under Kara's sway. And then my Mistaken did something that shocked us all. She had Kara take control of Xavier to make him strangle his own child. Again, I could have negotiated for Xavier, but we all more or less agreed that the child would die here, and the manner of death was a great explanation for the way Xavier would work tirelessly all his life to see an end to the fay and their goddess. Maybe taking the established history into account acted as a bit of a constraint, something I had worried over even before we started the game. I still had a great time, but I didn't feel free to push as hard as I could.<br/><br/>And that was how it happened, with a father forced to murder his son while my character blissfully made love to the ex from hell. It was disturbing, tragic, and utterly great. The dramatic tension of three or four different people advocating for different directions in the narrative was pretty phenomenal, and we're all looking forward to the next session. I have no idea what Pennar's next scene will be like--what do you do after you've failed anyone this horribly?--but I'm sure my lovely Mistaken will think of something awful to do to him. Can't wait. :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118754/#Comment_118754" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T08:37:45+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  8:37AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is absolutely delicious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
