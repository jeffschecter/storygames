However, I need some advice.  I am working on a mechanical system in which you weigh your priorities in a hierarchical fashion based on your rolls.  The simplest way it could work is as follows:<br/><br/>There are two factors in a conflict:<br/>a.) Do I get what I want?<br/>b.) What will I sacrifice to achieve this.<br/><br/>Say I roll 2d6 and my results are 5 and 1.  I have to choose how to prioritize the above factors.  If I favor getting what I want, I will assign the "5" to factor a and the "1" to factor b.  Consequently, I would suffer a bit.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I favor staying safe, I might assign the "5" to factor b and the "1" to factor a.  I won't suffer, but I probably won't get what I want either.<br/><br/>I feel like I want one (or two) more factor(s) to complete this basic system, but I'm not sure what other elements need to be prioritized in a conflict.  The only stipulation I can see is that the system work for physical/mental/social conflicts (with minor tweaks in and out for the three conflict arenas I just mentioned).<br/><br/>If anyone can think of other "priorities," that would be FANTASTIC.<br/><br/>Thank you all,<br/>~Klaus                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354021/#Comment_354021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T20:39:36+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  8:39PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick addendum:<br/><br/>One idea I've been mulling over for a third priority is "do I command the circumstances."

Nevertheless, I'd like to continue to develop ideas and throw my own "hat into the ring" with this system too.  I'll check out what you suggested, John.<br/><br/>I did have a wrinkle I'd REALLY like to consider adding.  If you have three or more factors to prioritize, maybe you get everything from the highest priority and then fewer and fewer things (even tipping the scales to bad things in the lowest priority!) as things decrease in hierarchical order.  Who knows, maybe it'll make you think harder about what you have to choose.<br/><br/>~Klaus<br/><br/>P.S.  I'm clearly developing something that has already been worked with.  I know this is a fundamental way that new innovations come about, but as long as I cite my influences, I feel like I shouldn't encounter too much hostility if any!  Ah well, I just want to create something with my own twist that will be fun for my friends, and, if successful there, with the rest of the community too.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354290/#Comment_354290" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T23:09:00+00:00" title="January 14, 2012 11:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, check out <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=91382" rel="nofollow">FUBAR</a>.<br/><br/>It was specifically written to address many of these concerns.
