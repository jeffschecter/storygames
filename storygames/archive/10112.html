In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10037" rel="nofollow">the game I am working on for my father</a>, I am going to drive character choice through cards.  In looking at the source material, there are character types:<br/><br/>The Singing Cowboy<br/>The World's Greatest Cowboy<br/>The Masked Cowboy<br/>The Gentleman Cowboy <br/>etc.<br/><br/>I could assign each type to a card and be done with that.  Each type would have unique bonuses during the game.<br/><br/>BUT.  I am envisioning expansions to this game, opening the genres to science fiction, superheroes, war, or other topics of serials.<br/><br/>So I can see breaking the above archetypes into two components.  With each component having unique bonuses during the game.<br/><br/>Singing, World's Greatest, Masked, Gentleman, etc.  <br/><br/>AND<br/><br/>Cowboy, with expansions adding Detective, Strongman, Astronaut, etc. later on.<br/><br/><br/>So my quandry is this: Do I sacrifice simplicity now for potential expansion later?  Or is there another solution I'm not seeing?<br/><br/><br/>Brainstorm away!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224494/#Comment_224494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T11:13:07+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 11:13AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 11:16AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't taken a look at <a href="http://dangerpatrol.com/" rel="nofollow">Danger Patrol</a> yet, you should.  It does this mechanic very nicely for a pulp science fiction setting, pairing traits like "Atomic" and "Two-Fisted" with classes such as "Professor" and "Robot."  I'm not sure what your design goals are, but I think that structure would work well for expansion.<br/><br/>As a side note, what got me into the thread at first was western character types.  Just the other day I was reading <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/stagec.html" rel="nofollow">this analysis of <i>Stagecoach</i></a> and was struck by the archetypal list of characters:<br/><br/>a prostitute (or dance hall gal) forced to leave town<br/>a embezzling banker<br/>a Confederate gambler<br/>a whiskey salesman<br/>an alcoholic, disgraced frontier doctor<br/>a pregnant young bride, the wife of an Army officer en route to his post<br/>a stage driver<br/>a Marshal riding shotgun<br/>a rugged, escaped outlaw<br/><br/>I guess my point is that a good story isn't all about the cowboys, so be sure not to neglect the other character types as you structure your cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224527/#Comment_224527" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T12:58:43+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:58PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points! Danger Patrol is influencing my thinking and I do want characters beyond cowboys - they just illustrated my point well.<br/><br/>Primary design goal: a game my 65ish father will play.  He's an old school card player, not really a gamer, and sulks when he loses board games. <br/>I am explicitly drawing on those he has identified as the heroes of his youth: the lone ranger, Tim mix, Roy Rogers, the cisco kid, and others. So there is a tendancy toward the idealized West of the Saturday morning serials                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
