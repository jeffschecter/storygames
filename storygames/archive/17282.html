Editing revealed some missing pieces that I have now added, and I feel that proofreading is the next step that needs to be taken.<br/>2) I can't afford anything at this time. If my situation was different, I'd be glad to pay.<br/>3) Doesn't that rely on reputation? I'm a nobody to the kickstarter crowd. <br/>4) I like the sound of exchanging favours. I'm working and studying for a degree, so I would have to fit in my half of the bargain around these responsibilities, but I'm sure that most of us here can't dedicate a huge amount of hours a week on things like proofreading or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391800/#Comment_391800" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T14:11:52+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  2:11PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please post a link to your game, I will read it.

Right now. Like, over then next 10 hours of otherwise baking and junk for me. </blockquote>\nThanks, Tilde. I've just messaged you a link to my game.\n<blockquote>There are also a number of Story Gamers on villages.cc if you want to go that angle.<br/><br/><a href="https://villages.cc/" rel="nofollow">https://villages.cc/</a><br/>--<br/>TAZ</blockquote>\nEero mentioned Villages too. I had a look at it and I'm in the middle of setting up my account. \n<blockquote>Can you pitch your game, to see if there are people potentially interested in it? What's is about? What do the players do? etc.</blockquote>\nThe setting is somewhere between DRYH's Mad City and Paris during the French Revolution. It was inspired by Victor Hugo's "Les Miserables", Charles Dicken's "A Tale of Two Cities" and the old TSR "Planescape: Torment" crpg. Oh, and Ralph Mazza and Mike Holme's "Universalis" was also an inspiration for how I designed the system.<br/><br/>Here's two passages from my game that describe what the game is about:<br/><br/>1.0 What You Do.<br/>De\ufb01ance is a game of cooperative storytelling where participants are player narrators role-playing rebels. You build stories by creating a city setting, deciding on a problem needing to be solved, and describing the actions of your rebel. Good stories unfold by fostering a balance between narration and role-playing.<br/><br/>4.0 Theme.<br/>The underlying theme that runs through almost all stories built from playing De\ufb01ance is corruption. The people and institutes that govern and rule the city are corrupt, but so are the rebels role-played by the player narrators. Rebels are deeply flawed characters. For all their talk of freedom or equality, they still hunger for power [...] <br/><br/>With corruption a theme at the heart of every story, you might assume that De\ufb01ance is about power corrupting, but this is not true. It is instead about how powers allows the already corrupted to extend the harm they can do to others. The actions of rebels cause a great deal of misery and suffering to their families and neighbours. From this angle, it becomes clear that the difference between rebels and corrupt authorities is only a matter of degrees.\n<blockquote>MJGraham, now is the time to call on all the people you've enthusiastically helped with difficult, time-consuming game-making tasks in the past. </blockquote>\nI wish I had helped others in the past. I guess I've always been hesitant to do so because I've not felt that I have the skill to be of any use.  About the only thing I have any background in is  playing and running games and as much as I'd like to do playtests for other people's games, I can't because I don't have a gaming group. That just leaves proofreading and editing, and as I just mentioned, I don't feel too confident in my ability to do either. But I am willing to give them a try if someone does need help and they don't mind my lack of experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
