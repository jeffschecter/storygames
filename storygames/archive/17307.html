The primary body parts being sewn together are from D&amp;D, World of Dungeons (Streets of Marienburg), and Old School Hack, with a little TSOY and Fiasco thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Inspired by Dungeon World's Perilous Journey procedure, I'm toying with the idea of specific procedures for common actions taken during adventuring. Here's one I'm brainstorming. Let me know how it tastes or if you spot any problems.<br/><br/><b>When you Hunker Down to rest in the wilderness or in the bowels of a dungeon</b>, first you <i>Make Camp</i>, then you <i>Break Bread</i>, then you <i>Take Watch</i>. After you\u2019ve Taken Watch, you must wait at least twelve hours before attempting to hunker down and rest again<br/><br/><b>When you Make Camp</b>, designate someone to make a Wisdom (Survival) roll.<br/>- On a Full Success, get +2 to the Take Watch roll.<br/>- On a Partial Success or a Fumble, get +1.<br/>- On a Failure, get -2.<br/><br/><b>When you Break Bread</b>, if you have any rations, you can consume one to be eligible to Heal Up and Level Up. This is also an opportunity for role-playing your Catalysts and Connections. After any role-playing is concluded, consider each of your Catalysts and decide if each of them is still relevant to your character and interesting to you. If you want to, you can drop a Catalyst and replace it with a new one that makes sense for your character. Likewise, consider each of your Connections and discuss with the other player if the Connection still makes sense. You can drop, add, or change Connections as you see fit.<br/><br/><b>When you Take Watch</b>, designate someone to make a Wisdom (Awareness) roll.<br/>- On a Full Success, you avoid detection and get some much needed rest. Everyone that consumed a ration can Level Up and Heal Up.<br/>- On a Partial Success, you avoid detection but your rest is troubled. Everyone can Level Up and Heal Up, but your Heal Up die is a d4 instead of the normal d8.<br/>- On a Failure, your rest is cut short by an interruption and you fail to see it coming. You can\u2019t Level Up or Heal Up.<br/>- On a Fumble, your rest is cut short an interruption, but your watchman spots the threat before it gets the drop on you. You still can\u2019t Level Up or Heal Up though.<br/><br/><b>When you Heal Up</b>, roll 1d8+Constitution and heal that many HP. If your rest was troubled, roll 1d4+Constitution instead. If someone in the group has the Treatment Skill, add that character\u2019s Level to your roll.<br/><br/><b>When you Level Up</b>, if you have enough XP to do so, you get to increase your level and upgrade your character\u2019s abilities per the Level Up chart.<br/><br/><b>When you rest in a safe place with a warm bed and a meal</b>, you can Break Bread, Heal Up, and Level Up no problem.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392401/#Comment_392401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T20:29:35+00:00" title="October  4, 2012  8:29PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why is a fumble better than a regular failure?<br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23counterintuitive&amp;Mode=like">#counterintuitive</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392403/#Comment_392403" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T20:44:54+00:00" title="October  4, 2012  8:44PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2012 8:45PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an element from Streets of Marienburg/World of Dungeons. When you have a Skill, you can't Fail - you Fumble instead, which is like a Partial Success but with worse consequences. An Unskilled person will Fail, while a Skilled person will Fumble instead. So if you have the Awareness Skill, you'll at least spot the threat before it has a chance to ambush your group. Maybe Fumble should go up in order in the list so it's clear that a Failure is the worst outcome? Or maybe just having that explanation before hand makes it less confusing? Or maybe a different term would make it less confusing?<br/><br/>Great. Thanks UserClone. Now if you search that hash tag on SG this thread is the only thread that comes up. That doesn't have any negative implications or anything.

The original intent was to discourage resting over and over again in a dangerous location.  But I agree that it's kind of tacked on there as an arbitrary restriction. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I want to make Hunker Down risky enough to discourage people from saying things like "Why pay for an inn when I can just sleep in the woods?" or "Let's just keep resting in this dungeon till we're all healed up." or "Okay, we fought two goblins - rest - then we dealt with that trap - rest - then we fought some more goblins - rest" (i.e., "The Five Minute Work Day"). Those situations to me are boring and unheroic.<br/><br/>Do you think with the inherent chance that your attempt to rest and heal could be interrupted, coupled with requirement to consume an expendable item like a ration, discourages this type of gameplay sufficiently?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392474/#Comment_392474" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T12:34:59+00:00" title="October  5, 2012 12:34PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2012 12:41PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>How about:<br/>Great Result<br/>Good Result<br/>Completed<br/>Failed<br/><br/>Tricky semantics problem, actually....</blockquote>\nVery true.
