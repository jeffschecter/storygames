It's about D&amp;D. The language is a bit stuffy and formal, but hopefully you all like it. Tell me what you think!<br/><br/><b>Hacking D&amp;D</b><br/><br/>I think everyone who has played more than a couple of sessions of D&amp;D has their own version of the game within them, waiting to come out. As a system it\u2019s so amenable to tinkering that it\u2019s almost impossible to resist. These hacks though don\u2019t often seem to go very far. Most people seem to end up back where they started, playing their favourite published edition of D&amp;D rather than their hack. The \u201cFantasy Heartbreaker\u201d - an author\u2019s \u201cimprovement\u201d of (usually later edition) D&amp;D is a notoriously difficult sell. OSR products are usually modules and materials for existing editions, or re-statements and reorganisations of older games. Why should this be the case? Why is D&amp;D at once so hackable and also so resistant to change?<br/><br/>Here\u2019s part of the reason, I think: The central metaphor for the strategy and challenge of D&amp;D isn\u2019t the pure cerebral planning of chess, or even the calculated risks of backgammon. It\u2019s Mao. For those who don\u2019t know, Mao is a card game of a very simple shedding type, but with additional rules of play which are kept secret and which players must guess or intuit during play. One player is responsible for maintaining adherence to the rules, and administers penalties (drawn cards) to players who infringe. Play is about remembering an unspoken set of arbitrary and often arcane rules, and about maintaining a shared commitment to an ever-increasing body of knowledge. It\u2019s fun because each play of a card is a step into the unknown, trusting that you\u2019ve remembered or interpreted the rules correctly. It\u2019s fun watching newer players stumble and be penalised for reasons they don\u2019t understand, but which make perfect sense to you. Each group of players has their own set of rules, constructed over time, understood to each of them, but almost impossible for an outsider to grasp.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is the same. The basic rules of play are simple enough, but the \u201cmeta\u201d rules, the rules about how to keep one\u2019s character alive in a dungeon, are unspoken, arcane, and endless. Players learn the rituals of checking for traps, of which monsters can be fought and which must be avoided, of how to manipulate the fiction of play to their advantage. The DM arbitrates, punishing players who have not mastered these secret rules, rewarding those who have. The players are complicit. They know that they will not understand all the rules, and that even doing everything right there is an element of risk. You make your move and you take your chances. Each play is a step into the unknown. Each group has their own understanding of the \u201cright\u201d way to behave in a dungeon, their own unspoken rules built up over time. Unlike Mao, however, encounters between groups with different rules are less likely to be productive and enjoyable, and more likely to cause friction. This is perhaps because of the persistent illusion that there\u2019s only one D&amp;D, while Mao players don\u2019t have that same belief. Different rules are part of the fun of that game. D&amp;D is also different in that the relationship between infringement and penalty is much less clear. In Mao, an infringement is instantly and unambiguously punished, while in D&amp;D, especially less functional D&amp;D, the relationship is less direct. The biggest difference is that Mao is at least nominally competitive. D&amp;D is not competitive at all. The joy of play comes entirely from testing and affirming the groups\u2019 mastery of the unspoken body of rules and rituals. Watching people fail is usually not part of the fun.<br/><br/>What implications does this have for hacking D&amp;D? I think that it\u2019s enormously tempting, and generally quite easy, to modify the procedures of play of D&amp;D to more closely fit with the unspoken rules of survival and with your aesthetics of play. This is done instantly and painlessly for some of the less central procedures. Some people play with a \u201ccaller\u201d, but many do not. Rules for ability checks are implemented very differently for different groups. It\u2019s also easier to go further. A typical tension is a friction between how the rules adjudicate outcomes (especially combat), and what the group expects \u201cshould\u201d be the outcome, based on their unspoken rules. Often, the unspoken rules take precedence, and the procedures of play are altered. More often though, the fiction exists in an uneasy d\xe9tente with the rules, and the players accept a certain amount of cognitive dissonance.<br/><br/>So why don\u2019t more groups hack D&amp;D? Why do so many return to playing a published edition of D&amp;D or a close clone thereof? There\u2019s certainly some truth to the argument that these are well designed games and that hacks usually create more problems than they solve in attempting to improve on them. But I don\u2019t believe that there have been no improvements in the art of game design in the forty-odd years since the game was published. I don\u2019t believe that the game as it stands in its original incarnation delivers on its goals better than any other conceivable design. I think that the chief advantage that D&amp;D has over any hack of D&amp;D is that it is D&amp;D. That is, the design is improved by the cultural cache that comes with the name Dungeons and Dragons. If you have accrued skill and experience playing some homebrew D&amp;D hack, that cache, that cultural capital is restricted to your home group, but skill and experience playing D&amp;D is transferrable \u2013 it is cultural capital that spends, at least within certain circles. The unspoken rules, rituals and procedures you learn playing D&amp;D are valuable (even if others\u2019 groups have very different unspoken rules), because other people recognise and respect them. Learning the same or similar rules under a homebrew system renders those skills suspect, and less valuable.<br/><br/>So what does that mean for D&amp;D hacks? Are they doomed to fail? Should we give up on trying to improve on Moldvay or Holmes or Gygax or whichever edition is your favourite? I don\u2019t want to say yes, but I don\u2019t see a way around it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364394/#Comment_364394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T18:09:31+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know very few people in real life or even on the blogs who <i>don't</i> play a hack.<br/><br/>Unless you require a certain (unstated) critical mass of rules changes before it qualifies as a 'hack'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364401/#Comment_364401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T18:39:23+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:39PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>I know very few people in real life or even on the blogs who<i>don't</i>play a hack.<br/><br/>Unless you require a certain (unstated) critical mass of rules changes before it qualifies as a 'hack'.</blockquote>\nFair point.

If the group thinks that they're playing by the rules as written, and strive to do so in fact to whatever degree they find practical, then I'd think that their behaviors will align in that way typical of by-the-rules play: they will care of what the rules say, and respect them. The group that recognizes that they're playing a houseruled version of the game will be more prone to question the rules and substitute ones they perceive as better. It's not about the amount of changes you do, but about why you're doing them: a GM who strives to play by the rules could make more changes in his effort to make contradictory or non-functional rules work than the other guy who decides that he's going to fix the game by hacking it, and one would still be a basically lawful group, while the other is hackery.<br/><br/>Could still be that practically nobody plays D&amp;D by the rules, at least older editions. I've only encountered real-life by-the-book attitudes regarding 3rd edition and up, but I remember reading in the Internet how some players of the older editions apparently find it important to think that they're playing by the official and correct rules.<br/><br/>Regarding Simon's central thesis, my own take is that the important key elements of D&amp;D are nearly non-mechanical, and nearly unrecognized in the traditional discussions, obsessed as they are with game mechanics. The true method, as I understand it, requires types of behaviours that essentially will lead a group to recreate D&amp;D over time (I'm thinking of things like precedent-based rules-development and game prep combined with player-controlled game direction here), utilizing very nearly the same organic, play-based processes that were originally used in Gygax's campaign that was spun into the early game texts. Worrying about adherence to the game text is a red herring when the game text only relates in passing to the core nature of the game, and mostly just regales us with plentiful detritus of the process of play.<br/><br/>In other words, I don't think that a D&amp;D hack is doomed to "fail", I think that playing an older edition game successfully is tantamount to hacking as you use the term here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364404/#Comment_364404" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T18:46:04+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I think that the chief advantage that D&amp;D has over any hack of D&amp;D is that it is D&amp;D.</blockquote>\nThis is the only part I agree with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364405/#Comment_364405" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T18:47:37+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:47PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The group that recognizes that they're playing a houseruled version of the game will be more prone to question the rules and substitute ones they perceive as better.</blockquote>\nThat's a really good point that I didn't touch on at all in the essay. Having a rule written down in a published book that you can point to gives that rule a lot more authority than a rule that you made up. When the stakes are so high (character life and death), it is probably useful for groups, especially groups without an ironclad commitment to the creative agenda, to have that to fall back on.

Can you elaborate?</blockquote>\nEero covered my thoughts pretty well concerning how groups naturally drift the rules to fit what they want.<br/><br/>Note: I\u2019m specifically talking about old Mentzer/Moldvay Basic D&amp;D below.<br/><br/>Personally I view D&amp;D the same way Luke Crane talks about Monopoly in his \u201cGame Design is Mind Control\u201d panel.<br/><br/>Most people don\u2019t use the rules of D&amp;D as written, then complain that D&amp;D doesn\u2019t make sense. In fact I\u2019d say that the vast majority of people who play D&amp;D have never used the rules the way they are written - this has led to a lot of confusion about what D&amp;D is.<br/><br/>For example I\u2019ve never played with a group that didn\u2019t use Critical Hit rules. But I\u2019m looking at my books and there isn\u2019t anything, not a single word in there, about Critical Hits or the difference between a normal roll and a natural 20.<br/><br/>In fact, most people don\u2019t bother with Wandering Monsters, Encumbrance, Reaction rolls, or any of the other rules because, from what I\u2019ve seen, they dismiss these rules out of hand. Partially because of this culture of oral tradition that has seemed to pass throughout the community through the years.<br/><br/>Some of this is from normal human ego, \u201cI can do better than this! I don\u2019t need a chart to tell me when drama occurs!\u201d. Heck that is me when I first ran D&amp;D at age 12.<br/><br/>But if one doesn\u2019t bother even using the rules how can one hope to hack it. If one doesn\u2019t understand what the rules are there for how can one hack it.<br/><br/>For example: most people hate, hate, hate encumbrance. But they don\u2019t seem to realize the reason it is there.<br/><br/>All of this is to say that if a person doesn\u2019t understand why a rule is there they are more likely to start drifting and hacking the game apart.

It\u2019s Mao. For those who don\u2019t know, Mao is a card game of a very simple shedding type, but with additional rules of play which are kept secret and which players must guess or intuit during play. One player is responsible for maintaining adherence to the rules, and administers penalties (drawn cards) to players who infringe. Play is about remembering an unspoken set of arbitrary and often arcane rules, and about maintaining a shared commitment to an ever-increasing body of knowledge.</blockquote>\nAt the OD&amp;D boards, howandwhy99 also says that D&amp;D is a pattern recognition game. His metaphor is Mastermind - one person has the truth hidden behind the screen, the others try to guess and learn more about the pattern with each attempt.<br/><br/>I buy this historically - it makes a lot of sense out of how OD&amp;D's just about only example of play talks about how to screw with your player's map so it takes them longer to make it match the referee's map. However howandwhy99 runs his games with rules hacks that are part of the guessing. I will play with him at Gary Con but until them I am not sure what it looks like: do you need spell components or not? keep a careful record of what happens when you cast with and without them.<br/><br/>That's <a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/telling-players-what-they-need-to-hit/" rel="nofollow">totally alien to my approach</a> rules-wise - for things like combat I like the parts of 4e where the mechanics are so transparent they can be a group effort.<br/><br/>However the "ever increasing body of knowledge" does apply to long-term campaign play. James has often posted about how the point of my White Sandbox campaign, especially when we were in the Caverns of Thracia megadungeon, is to amass a ton of lore about the setting that was vital to survival, and made infrequent players at a disadvantage if they didn't keep up with "why this passage and not that one".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364429/#Comment_364429" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T20:01:00+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  8:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Irminsul</cite>And my response is, "really?!

More often though, the fiction exists in an uneasy d\xe9tente with the rules, and the players accept a certain amount of cognitive dissonance.</blockquote>\nSo part of why one can\u2019t simply say \u201cD&amp;D\u201d anymore and expect any sort of real communication:<br/><br/>Edition wars over D&amp;D actually make sense, in a strange sort of way. You see the rules in Basic Mentzer/Moldvay really are apart from AD&amp;D1e which started to include more and more complex rules and even a different focus. Then the shift that AD&amp;D2e started completely changed things. I mean there isn\u2019t even XP for gold anymore! So 2nd edition is really where things started to move away from what I think of when somebody says, \u201cD&amp;D\u201d. Monsters are pretty much the only source of XP, and now the Reward System starts to break down - the system needed more and more rules to cover combat and not dying and not being able to run away and... don\u2019t even get me started on \u201cKits\u201d and the focus on \u201cstory\u201c. 3rd edition moves even farther a field with battle maps and Attacks of Opportunity. With 4th edition going, yet again, even further astray by making death pretty much impossible and loading up characters with what is tantamount to super powers.<br/><br/>But you see, all of this was a natural extension of the culture and oral traditions that were being passed down. All of the \u201cfixes\u201d of the editions created that dissonance that you speak of. The metaphorical dominoes start to fall and unexpected \u201cdissonance\u201d becomes unavoidable.<br/><br/>Why? Because people started to \u201cexpect\u201d an outcome. They expected their character to live, in part because without stable characters there is not as much room for story and plot. Basic D&amp;D doesn\u2019t promise that as the rules imply. AD&amp;D started that promise of character focus, and it came to fruition with 2nd edition, gained more life in 3rd edition, and with 4th death is nearly impossible.<br/><br/>And that example is just a \u201cD&amp;D is about combat\u201d example! But then that is what D&amp;D has become. What D&amp;D was\u2026 that was entirely different! One did not simply go around and kill things. A smart player avoided combat and got the loot! That was, after all, the real source of XP.<br/><br/>EDIT: I believe this is why people think that D&amp;D is about combat and not exploration of the fictional space as well. The weight of the rules started to create this sense of "wait the rules don't match the fiction!", just look at 4th edition. If one has rules-bloat then most people will naturally turn to rules as written for answers. Just look at thieves: anybody could pick a lock or disarm a trap, but once one has these "skills" the players stop to innovate and describe and fall back on, "my dude picks the lock. I rolled a 10", or whatever. (And since I'm starting to sound like a Grognard anyway I might as well). The DMs job was not to obfuscate the dungeon! How would the players interact with it then? It really was/is a "Fiction First" game: "tell me what you want to do and we'll figure out a way to make it happen". But then, once again, this cultural oral tradition sprang up and people stopped reading the rules and just played the way they wanted to - even if the way they started to play didn't make sense and they complained about it!<br/><br/>Conclusion: D&amp;D had stones that were stepped upon to get to where it is today.

They're well within to scope of common D&amp;D practice. Stars Without number is in space. Dungeon World I figure is more AD&amp;D than Basic, but also, is maybe an exception to the rule. We'll see what happens.<br/><br/>Roger,<br/><br/>Sorry you don't like it! I get what you're saying. Maybe it would help if you read it as "here's a thing I noticed, and here's a theory about why that might be"?<br/><br/>Tavis,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite><br/><br/>At the OD&amp;D boards, howandwhy99 also says that D&amp;D is a pattern recognition game. His metaphor is Mastermind - one person has the truth hidden behind the screen, the others try to guess and learn more about the pattern with each attempt.</blockquote>\nThat's fascinating. That speaks nicely to the relationship the players and the DM have to the dungeon. I think bigger picture play is about affirming and testing unspoken rules that everyone knows.<br/><br/>Zac D,<br/><br/>What I mean with that bit is that, like, we play this game that is all about close attention to minute details of the fiction. We know a heck of a lot about these characters, and what they're capable of. But then we have these rules which often interact pretty crudely with the fictional details. Things like armour making you harder to hit, or thieves being the only ones with a chance to hide in shadows and so on. You either start hacking, and face the consequences of that, or else you accept that there's going to be a conflict sometimes. I think people tend to arrive at a compromise that works for their group, but that keeping play within the broad umbrella of "D&amp;D" is a pressure on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364485/#Comment_364485" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T00:18:16+00:00" title="March  2, 2012 12:18AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

Lots of New York Red Box experience suggests that the differences between B/X and OD&amp;D are major - Eric and I haven't run one another's campaigns and some is selection bias, but if I forced Eric to play B&amp;X he would become more loosey-goosey even if that's not what he chose the system for, and B/X would force me to tighten up a lot and look to the rules instead of consensus for all the things OD&amp;D leaves undefined.<br/><br/>Dungeon World is hugely different. Even in my hands the idea that doing damage will not be the first thing I reach for when it's my turn meant that Keep on the Borderlands turned out radically different. jenskot's background meant that the idea that you are the only fighter made things even more different. A lifetime of Basic or Original D&amp;D teaches me that the Keep on the Borderlands is designed to be staffed by 300 fighters just like you, plus a handful more powerful, all of whom are more interested in developing automated procedures for slaughtering you if you do the wrong thing than participating in a story in which you are unique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364531/#Comment_364531" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:00:45+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:00AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 6:02AM by Tavis.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Repost, sorry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364545/#Comment_364545" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:56:32+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:56AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Irminsul</cite>So yeah, if one started playing in 2nd/3rd/4th that was expected.

The club I played at started with all that stuff (OD&amp;D + Greyhawk), and moved away from it because we didn't think it was fun.  High lethality(*)?  No fun once you've run a character for a while.  Mapping?  OK, but when the emphasis moved (as it quickly did) from dungeons to missions, wasn't much missed.  Experience from treasure?  Dropped for experience from mission success.  (Also, I was playing with a bunch of war-gamers -- they <em>liked</em> combat, and hardly wanted to reduce it.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I found my combat magic rules from 1983 (my Gothic Isles campaign ran from about 1975 to sometime into the 90's).  13 pages of typed. single-space rules and tables, not including spell lists and spell descriptions.  And that was just one aspect of the game.  Total house rules? God knows.<br/><br/>(*) Characters still died fairly regularly, but Raise Dead was widely available, though it did cause a a loss of a consitution point each time.  This could eventually lead to a character retiring if the player didn't feel like making an effort to keep them in play (most players had multiple characters, although they'd only play one at a time), or it could become an excuse for quest or taking a high-risk mission from a patron who could supply a means of restoring constitution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364702/#Comment_364702" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T14:55:51+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  2:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 2:57PM by SavageHominid.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Irminsul</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Right, but the expectation of our game became "you will survive or be hilariously reincarnated/resurrected, because otherwise everyone else has to sit their with their thumb up their ass while we wait for your wizard to re-level 10 times to catch up to the rest of us".  That's what I was getting at, that there was more than one reason (and many non-story reasons) for people to begin to expect their D&amp;D characters to survive.</blockquote>\nRight. That is why the game has those spells: because once one got the character that far into the [high] levels the nature of the game changed. So, yeah, the game has resurrection spells. I think I missed something?<br/><br/>EDIT: maybe I shouldn't point this out but the game has those XP charts and they double every level. So that means that once the higher level character levels once the lower level character is now exactly one level behind.<br/><br/>So again I think I'm missing something here.

One did not simply go around and kill things. A smart player avoided combat and got the loot! That was, after all, the real source of XP.<br/><br/>EDIT: I believe this is why people think that D&amp;D is about combat and not exploration of the fictional space as well.</blockquote>\nThe same day I read this, I read the following in a post on the <a href="http://community.wizards.com/dndnext/blog/2012/03/01/hit_points" rel="nofollow">Wizards Community website</a>...\n<blockquote>[...] a play style that denied the most exciting aspects of the game: combat. Rather than kicking down doors and slaughtering all the monsters, characters relied on cunning, stealth, and simple robbery to earn their experience points. (After all, characters acquired more XP from treasure than they ever could from fighting.) </blockquote>\nWhich really drove home for me a point that's already been made - differing priorities have driven the development of different editions and hacks. I think, given the choice, I'd actually choose 1st Edition AD&amp;D with the cunning and looting and exploration of fictional space, but that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364893/#Comment_364893" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T13:32:21+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  1:32PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite><cite>Posted By: Storn</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I dunno, I think it's a bit more fundamental than that.

No where near the customization of say, Champions.  Remember, D&amp;D is coming out of Chainmail, a wargame that happened to tag on some fantasy elements almost as an afterthought and then became really popular in the Lake Geneva area.  D&amp;D was born.  Wargames are not hackable.  They are meant to be games that one can win or lose and the rules need to be consistent for both parties.  Those early brown booklets, where I started, had NOTHING about "hey, if you don't like a rule, don't use it or change it".  Now, this is offset by the GM's authority, which is almost absolute.  THEY could handwave all they wanted... but that is not the same as hacking.  That is arbitration.<br/><br/>Hacking to me is changing mechanics to fit the mood and needs of the table and the genre they are trying to explore.<br/>Err... flatly not true. Read the introduction in<i>Men &amp; Magic</i>(book 1) -- it's<i>all about</i>hacking the game.  It goes so far as too recommend that players mark changes in the rules by the GM in their copies of the book in pencil.<br/><br/>Yeah, the hacking of wargames was a fine old tradition long before the publication of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>And even the idea that wargames are only supposed tobe a win/lose experience is still a bit controversial among wargamers. There are a number of heretical wargaming cults that have slightly different takes on the very concept.<br/><br/>Yes, it's true: Even wargamers have their dirty-hippies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364926/#Comment_364926" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T15:30:12+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  3:30PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I\u2019ll try one more time:<br/><br/>I\u2019m not saying, \u201cdon\u2019t hack D&amp;D\u201d.<br/><br/>What I\u2019m saying is, \u201cif you hack/drift D&amp;D you are going to get something that isn\u2019t [Basic] D&amp;D. You add in more classes and more rules and take away race-as-class, well you just made AD&amp;D1e. Stats aren\u2019t high enough and characters are dying too often and gold-as-xp doesn\u2019t make sense? You just made AD&amp;D2e. Combat isn\u2019t exciting enough and wandering monsters are weird and characters are still too weak, so you add in Feats and powers, and you just made D&amp;D3e and the adventuring day of 15 minutes followed by 8 hours of rest\u2026\u201d.<br/><br/>That is all I\u2019m saying, \u201chacking D&amp;D leads to other versions of D&amp;D, and there is nothing wrong with that, but what you made is a new edition of D&amp;D\u201d.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, what I\u2019m hearing others say is, \u201cD&amp;D isn\u2019t made to be played rules-as-written\u201d, and I respond with, \u201cbullshit, D&amp;D is perfectly playable as-is\u201d.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Hacking D&amp;D

Most groups are playing with at least some explicit changes to the rules as written, and pretty much every group plays with implicit interpretations of the procedures.<br/><br/>- Playing "Canonical D&amp;D", at least in name, has the additional benefit of giving the group an authoritative source to fall back on, while hacked rules are more subject to question.<br/><br/>- The "real" D&amp;D isn't so much the mechanics of play (Stats, hit points, clesses etc) as it is the procedures of play (precedent-based rules, GM-prep + player-direction). As such, the "hacking" question is kind of moot. I dunno if I agree with this or not, but it's an interesting question.<br/><br/>- There are some games that could be considered D&amp;D hacks that have been successful (i.e. published). It seems to me that these are typically games which change the core assumptions of play, making it less about dungeon exploration. Tunnels and Trolls is an exception though. I can't think of any other games that could be claimed to deliver on D&amp;D's core experience better than D&amp;D does.<br/><br/>Does that sound right? Am I missing anything?

Because the mechanics and procedures of play are so unclear/minimal, you have to engage in some interpretation/hacking just to be able to play.<br/><br/>So, to restate the core thesis of my essay, taking into account the feedback above:<br/><br/>No one out-D&amp;Ds D&amp;D. 0e/1e D&amp;D is still the best game for delivering games about dungeon exploration where testing player skill in "dungeoneering" is the core of play. This is not because D&amp;D has the best mechanical procedures for producing this sort of game (in fact, almost everyone uses variations on these rules), but rather because:<br/><br/>1) A published body of rules is more authoritative than a homebrew system<br/><br/>2) For this style of play, the mechanics of play are less important than some of the (unstated) core procedures<br/><br/>3) (And this what I raised in my original essay) There is value in having the game you're playing be recognisably "D&amp;D", rather than some other game. This is maybe because the "dungeoneering" skills you learn playing the game only have tranferrability and cultural credibility if they're tied to some recognizable game.<br/><br/>Does that make sense to people? How do you react to "Option 3". Does that seem credible to you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365096/#Comment_365096" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T14:33:33+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  2:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2012 2:34PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><br/>No one out-D&amp;Ds D&amp;D. 0e/1e D&amp;D is still the best game for delivering games about dungeon exploration where testing player skill in "dungeoneering" is the core of play. </blockquote>\nI would say that profoundly depends on the group.<br/><br/>For a group that is new to dungeon-exploration games--yeah, maybe D&amp;D is the best.

Specifically 1st edition AD&amp;D; started to value the character more and more as something prebuilt with a background rather than created in play.  They also began creating the bigger plot adventures like Dragonlance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they moved away from dungeons and towards bigger plots and mission style play how you ran the game changed.  That playstyle that the OSR puts forward doesnt really work anymore when you have an ongoing story that makes it harder to swap characters in and out.  You no longer want characters facing the threat of dieing constantly if the characters personality, background and how they deal with this situation they've become invested in is a big part of the game.  The roguish work ethic doesnt really make sense for characters motivated by something other than attaining wealth.  Hirelings and henchmen make sense when you are mounting an expedition to the wilderness and ancient ruins, less so when you are doing secretive small unit tactical strikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe base mechanics of AC, Hp, levels and classes may continue to work but a lot of the less mechanical aspects of play definitely change like scenario creation and world design.  Then there's the question of whether the mechanics are still really achieving your goals, if creating interesting character before play starts becomes standard does D&amp;D; with it's limited mix of classes and races really adequate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365272/#Comment_365272" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T11:52:50+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 11:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 11:55AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>That playstyle that the OSR puts forward doesnt really work anymore when you have an ongoing story that makes it harder to swap characters in and out.

I'll try to clarify what I was getting at.   D&amp;D; is about the dungeon crawl, it's about getting treasure and/or killing monsters.  If your game becomes less about doing that then how do you proceed?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Game of Thrones as an example, the characters never gain treasure and rarely kill monsters so how do the characters ever gain in levels and what does that even mean in such a game?  Nobody is suddenly becoming harder to kill in battle or learning new magic.   The social situation changes but the characters cant affect it by forming an expedition to a remote area and exploring an ancient tomb.  The mechanics of D&amp;D; wouldnt come into play at all in most cases so how do you decide what happens?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get play to work in such a game you are going to either hack the rules or ignore them.  They did exactly that when they started putting out the Dragonlance modules.  The pregened characters were there to be used and they werent supposed to be killed off before they got to play their part in the bigger story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365355/#Comment_365355" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T14:59:12+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  2:59PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 3:00PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simplest way:<br><br>Sandbox world.

But without some kind of new way of approaching player-authored flags, all a GM could do (knew how to do, maybe) was to treat back-story like just another part of GM prep - something you incorporated into the game as able, but not necessarily front and center or in a way that gave the PC meaningful choice - - the "show-casing" was treated like it should be enough for the player, in my experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365488/#Comment_365488" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T07:46:21+00:00" title="March  6, 2012  7:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason I grabbed on to the Game of Thrones reference is because it's precisely what I was talking about in regards to changing to a different style plot.  It's characters dont show the "Roguish work ethic" they arent really motivated by gaining gold.  Like Nikodemus says they have actionable desires so there is some kind of game to be had there but it's not really D&amp;D; anymore.  The mechanics of the game assume you are chasing treasure and fighting monsters, if you dont do that and instead change to different goals then you need to hack the system to accomodate.  It might be a small hack like giving xp out for resolving a situation rather than for gp acquired.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what it comes down to is the support for the GM to make decisions.  D&amp;D; has tons of it if you have characters who are interested in going into dungeons and hunting for treasure.  It gives you tons of monsters, instructions on how to make dungeons, how much xp to get for beating monsters and getting their gold.  But it doesnt give you any advice on how to decide non combat actions or how to build situations outside a dungeon, when you move to that you are hacking the system and it's not really a surprise because that's what they were doing all along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365497/#Comment_365497" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T08:18:12+00:00" title="March  6, 2012  8:18AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2012 8:30AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Vernon">@Vernon</a>: I mean, all the characters in GoT *need* gold. I figure you could look at them as being Level 9 PCs, i.e. "lords" with property and responsibilities and such. I think it sells D&amp;D short to look at it as a perennial dungeon-crawling game - - you crawl around in dungeons until you don't have to any longer, amirite? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>In terms of 0e/1e, anyway, this seems to be reasonable. A powerful warlord might decide to go tomb-raiding again with the fellas, just for kicks, but the player guiding him is more concerned with paying the men-at-arms and levying taxes and that tricky land war brewing in Asia. <br/><br/>Monte Cook has been writing about 5e of late over on the Wizards website, and he been saying how he likes the 4e system of three-tiered play, and that it's a feature of play to treat different level ranges as quite different game experiences - early levels for the sword-hobo aesthetic, middle levels for the growing power (but still adventuring), and high levels for the land ownership and political intrigue. <br/><br/>One of the big features of older D&amp;D, imo, is that a lot is completely left up to the DM's discretion and inspiration so that it can kind of go wherever. Yes, that's kind of a cop-out, but historically this interpretation does pan out. <br/>At high levels, I think the internal reward system changes up - - once you own property and have followers, you will likely be compelled to do what you can to either hang onto, or build upon, your new power base. The mentality of "up, up, up!" has gotten you this far, and now that mentality moves into the fiction and away from the explicit mechanics.<br/><br/>Of note: a lot of GP=XP dungeon crawl games make it pretty clear that you only get XP from cash that's found on an adventure; robbing random travelers and taxing your vassals are not "adventurous", and therefore don't grant XP... but gold is gold, and Lordly characters have bills to pay. So while surface-world activities won't keep your character level going up, they will help you to maintain what you've accomplished (at least enough to pay for it all). <br/>Different stage of the game = different priorities. <br/><br/>On the other hand, my first thought is: why not just have a game where you start at the Lord tier? And my answer to myself (haha) is: yeah! Why the hell not? Eero has pointed out before that monsters keep getting tougher with every level, so on a personal level your character can only really feel powerful if she goes back to lower level dungeons to kick some ass.<br/>The answer to the riddle is this: not only does a high level character have a lot less to worry about financially, but she also has a lot less to worry about in terms of finding henchmen, porters, torch bearers, specialists, etc. If your power doesn't grow in the fictional realm over time, you're being short-changed. This is a divide or angle (fictional vs. personal power) that AW touches on quite a bit, and I think working that understanding into D&amp;D could be quite fruitful when considering what high-level play is "all about". <br/><br/>As for the lack of mechanical support for stuff, well... that complaint is as old as D&amp;D, and I solved that problem for myself by simply playing other games. OSR games treat this lack like a feature, and relish the sheer amount of adjudication required by the DM, while more recent D&amp;D editions have simply expanded to cover more spheres of activity with concrete rules. [<i>edit: for what it's worth, adjudicating is a lot of fun for me. And I like doing so really transparently, too - - it feels a lot like taking a pause to make a ruling in AW. Can you tell I've been playing a lot of AW lately? haha</i>]<br/><br/>EDIT: Have you read the <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?402972-The-Zen-of-Old-School-D-amp-D" rel="nofollow">Old School Zen Manifesto</a>? Basically, it's not an argument about "doing it wrong" so much as it is (imo) an attempt to give old school dungeon crawling games their proper context/mentality.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365513/#Comment_365513" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T10:33:40+00:00" title="March  6, 2012 10:33AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2012 10:34AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite><br/>So what it comes down to is the support for the GM to make decisions.

Adding in new rules to respond to new ideas, adding in new classes, adding new ways to generate characters that brought about better ability scores, non weapon proficiencies, etc.  Changing play style to better match what they wanted out of the game, moving away from roguish play to heroic to superheroic to antiheroes.  Heck if you look at the whole hobby once the idea of roleplaying individual characters took off every game is just a hack on that basic idea, they just decided to use different mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI havent read that Old School Zen Manifesto (cant access it from here)  but I've read the Old School Primer that's on Lulu and several of the blogs.  I think the Old school has done an excellent job of detailing a playstyle that was pretty big at one time and makes a lot of sense when you look at it through that lens that they put forward.  It gives a lot of advice and help on ways to get that style and helps understand what that playstyle is like that wasnt always clear in the original texts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat playstyle isnt for everyone though and even at the time it was in full swing many people were moving away from it because they wanted something else from their games.  That doesnt necessarily equate to needing a recipe for anything you want to accomplish in the game, sometimes the reason people want those things in the game is because they want those aspects to be meaningful (or not) in the the same way AC and Hp are in D&amp;D.;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15999/hacking-d-d-an-essay" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15999/hacking-d-d-an-essay" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15999/hacking-d-d-an-essay/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15999%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15999%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
