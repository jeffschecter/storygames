He made a comment which kind of took me off guard-he said that most prison employees simply don't believe that rehabilitation works, and that their job as they see it is basically to separate prisoners from society (for a certain length of time, anyway) in an attempt to keep people safe.<br/><br/>Of course, this got me thinking of game setting ideas.  When did exile fall out of fashion as a punishment?  Currently, when we want to keep criminals away from the population forever (and if we're too squeamish to execute them), we keep them in jail without parole until they die-at great cost to taxpayers (especially as the inmates age and require greater medical care).  What if, instead, we shipped them off somewhere-say, a deserted island-and left them to their fates?  What would happen?<br/><br/>I'm guessing you could only do this with the worst-of-the-worst:  the truly violent, hardcore monsters.<br/><br/>Some things I thought of:<br/><br/>1.  You avoid the capital punishment moral debate.  Sure, they'll probably die-the place'll likely turn into a Lord of the Flies-type situation, or it will be difficult to find enough potable water/food/shelter to support the population, there's no medical care, etc...but you aren't the one doing the actual killing.  Nature is.<br/><br/>2.  Would the prisoners be trained in basic survival/living-off-the-land skills before being shipped out?  What kind of equipment would they be issued...knives?  Flint and steel?  Would there be scheduled food drops to the island?  If so, wouldn't those just be seized by the strongest gang?<br/><br/>3.  What about the media?  Would VICE news try to infiltrate to show the people back home the true story of how people are living and dying on the island?<br/><br/>4.  How would the families and friends of the convicts deal with this situation?  There would likely be no mail or other form of contact once the prisoner was resettled, for instance.<br/><br/>What do you all think?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434448/#Comment_434448" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T01:50:18+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  1:50AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sure sounds like you want to discuss the philosophy and politics of exile as an institution of legal punishment more than a game based on the concept <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Not that this wouldn't make for a valid game setting.

Being a penal colony is a stage of development, not a static end-point. (Except of course for those penal colonies that literally are on barren islands in the middle of nowhere; however, those have historically been more like open-air prisons, rather than the hands-off kind of thing we're discussing here.)<br/><b>*</b> Real people are almost always not "vicious criminals" as some sort of objective classification, and the idea that such <i>couldn't</i> start a community when left to their own devices smacks amusingly of 19th century Romanticist ideas. I would frankly be amazed if a random selection of criminals from any society <i>couldn't</i> do anything that a random selection of the population at large could.<br/><b>*</b> "Civilization" is just the name for that which propagates itself in the social sphere. Take a million apes, let the less viable 99% kill each other (or whatever anti-civilized behaviours they might engage in), and those who are left will pretty much by default have some sort of "civilization".<br/><br/>Were I developing a game about this topic, I would, as is my inclination, select a scenario with maximal ambiguity and possibilities, the sort where we can discover in play whether our characters are fundamentally unfit human specimens, whether the land of exile can be made fit for human habitation, and so on. (This, as opposed to a game where the designer predetermines these thematic answers.)<br/><br/>I could see a random table for finding out what crime brought you to the colony, for example, and a secret low-probability secondary check to see if you were actually innocent of the crime. Some characters might become non-criminal officers of the colonial infrastructure, too, in this random chargen. Just set up a bunch of people who approach the situation from a variety of angles, and then put them through the wringer; see what they make of their circumstances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434457/#Comment_434457" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T08:41:56+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  8:41AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game you're looking for is Durance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434463/#Comment_434463" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T12:11:11+00:00" title="June 27, 2014 12:11PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're going historical, I recommend reading Foucault's "Madness and Civilization".<br/>If you're going post-apoc Mad Maxian Earth, maybe check out <a href="http://www.icewebring.com/ICE_Products/CS/CS_5105_DeathValleyFreePrison.php" rel="nofollow">Death Valley Free Prison</a> (it's a campaign setting/sourcebook).<br/>If you're going to the stars, I think <a href="/forums/profile/snej">@snej</a> nailed it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434515/#Comment_434515" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T09:45:50+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  9:45AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Durance.<br/><br/>However, there is also potential for making this into a "reality TV" show, as Eero suggests - that was my first reaction to this pitch.<br/><br/>As for why we don't do this:<br/><br/>1. The Earth is getting pretty crowded. There aren't too many places we could "send" people to where they'd have a good chance of survival but ALSO couldn't escape from easily. <br/><br/>Exile worked well when transportation was a difficult thing. These days... not so much.<br/><br/>We can "exile" people from our country... but then some other country has to take them. Who will do that? (Actually, it's quite possible that someone would... but in the long-term it's not obvious that this system would maintain itself.)<br/><br/>2. I think most people have a strong reaction to the idea of sending potentially fragile/weak people (women, children, the wrongfully accused, the infirm, the sickly, the pregnant, elderly, etc) into a dangerous situation with known killers/rapists or other hardened criminals.<br/><br/>Would you send the young nerdy kid who decided to sell pot to his classmates and the old man who was sentenced because his skin was the wrong colour to be stuck on an island with three child-murderers/serial-killers/sociopathic gang members?<br/><br/>To most people, this doesn't *feel* right, or like justice.<br/><br/>It's not an obvious problem.<br/><br/>Otherwise, however, I'm quite fond of the idea of taking the "unwanted" out of society (meaning that each society/community consists of people who have chosen to be a part of it and live by its rules), so long as they have somewhere else viable to go.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
