It's essentially a system for creating Dungeon World-compatible characters using the fourth edition D&amp;D character creation process, although I threw in a few house rules that I think would make the conversion easier and the result "feel" more D&amp;Dish.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>4E World is a modified Dungeon World game hidden in the fourth edition of the world\u2019s first roleplaying game. You can still play invokers and sorcerers and warlords with powers like <i>sly gambit </i>and <i>mists of madness, </i>but gone is square-by-square movement and keeping track of niggling small bonuses.<br/><br/>Essentially, what's described here is a system for using the 4E character creation process to create Dungeon World-compatible characters. I've thrown in a few extra rules that I think make a lot of sense, but they're certainly not necessary.\n<h2><b>Natasha Greyscarlet</b></h2>\n<b>Tiefling Hexblade 1; </b>STR 11, DEX 16, CON 8, INT 14, WIS 11, CHA 18<br/><b>HP </b>14; <b>Armor </b>1 (leather); <b>Damage </b>d8 (wand)<br/><b>Equipment </b>Dungeon rations 5, adventuring gear 5; <b>Skills </b>History, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery<br/><b>SQ </b>Low-light vision; Fire resistance; Fey pact<br/><b>Raven Queen </b>Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate.\n<h3><b>Moves</b></h3>\n<b>Infernal Wrath (recharge, far, triggered; fire): </b>If <i>an enemy hits you</i>, you call upon the hellfire burning in your soul to punish them.<br/><br/><b>Soul Step:</b> When you <i>reduce an enemy to 0 HP </i>or when <i>a Close enemy drops to 0 HP, </i>you briefly become a creature of wind and mist.<br/><br/><b>Pact Weapon: </b>When you <i>hold your implement in one hand</i>, you manifest a pact weapon in the other.\n<ul>\n<li><b><b>Blade of Winter\u2019s Mourning: </b></b>Close; finesse, living metal, cold.

Those stats are the arrays used in 4E D&amp;D - I thought it would be very elegant to have them be directly usable in 4E World as well. But if they're really high, maybe what I can do instead is offer equivalent arrays ("If you're using 16, 14, 14, 11, 10, 10, instead use 13, 12, 12, 10, 9, 8").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434603/#Comment_434603" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T10:02:48+00:00" title="June 30, 2014 10:02AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, here are some options:<br/><br/>If you want the math to match DW, then your stats should look something like this:<br/><br/>5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13<br/><br/>Or you can give up on that, and use a stat array like you just suggested (a little higher). It'll make the characters a little more competent, but it won't break the system. (Although the standard D&amp;D4E array probably would!)<br/><br/>But here are two other options which might be interesting:<br/><br/>1. Come up with your own character-generation system for this hack. Then you can manipulate the probabilities as you like (instead of just assigning numbers from an array).<br/><br/>For instance, you could do something like this:<br/><br/>Roll 3d6. Record the result.<br/>Now subtract the result from 20. Record that result.<br/><br/>Repeat this three times, and you have six ability scores - assign them as you like.<br/><br/>This feels D&amp;D-esque (because you're rolling 3d6 for stats), but gives you numbers in the desired range AND keeps characters balanced with each other (everyone will have the same total number of points in their ability scores).<br/><br/>2. Work a modifier into the system, so you can use appropriately high-feeling stats. The most obvious way is to make an unpenalized roll "easy", and add a negative modifier for most typical rolls (e.g. -4).<br/><br/>However, it's not terribly elegant.<br/><br/>Here's maybe a better way:<br/><br/>For every roll, there is a "difficulty" number, which ranges from 2 for an easy task to 5 for a difficult task, and maybe up to 7 or 8 for a really daunting task.<br/><br/>When you make your ability check, you must roll equal to or below your ability score, but you must also match the difficulty.<br/><br/>So, a roll at difficulty 4, for a person with Strength 14, would succeed for any roll of 4 or higher, so long as it doesn't exceed 14. (Which is equivalent to rolling a +1 stat in DW.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434765/#Comment_434765" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-03T06:57:58+00:00" title="July  3, 2014  6:57AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback, Paul - I appreciate it. <br/><br/>I like the idea of the difficulty number, because you can tie it in with the Easy, Moderate and Hard tiers of skill difficulty class in 4E - perhaps Difficulties 2, 4 and 6 for Easy, Moderate and Hard.
