Why not let the freeform nature of the rule challenge our ability to structure mechanics or systems or fixes on the fly, and have fun with that?" It's not a good idea because Rule Zero forces us, in the middle of a game, to respond to player concerns at an emotional or social level with mechanical patches. [...] Role-playing game mechanics are for making up stories, <b>not fixing someone's emotional response to entertainment</b>. That way lies madness. Even when playtesting a game, we generally like to table feedback until after the session is over, rather than arguing over mechanics in mid-session.</blockquote>\nEmphasis added.<br/><br/>We can't design toward particular emotional responses to play experience; we can design towards particular narrative structures.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309421/#Comment_309421" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T21:38:06+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  9:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>We can't design toward particular emotional responses to play experience; we can design towards particular narrative structures.</blockquote>\nI think this is generally true of artistic media.  It is completely subjective how people will emotionally respond to your painting, novel, or RPG - and this can indeed by maddening.  It would be nice if your novel were judged by some objective criteria that you could write to, instead of just how people like it.  However, it is what it is.  <br/><br/>You can, by choice, write your novel or RPG without thinking about how people will emotionally respond to it, concentrating only on narrative structure.

So, in a sense, I agree with you. While a buddy comedy game is designed towards that kind of humour, with it own sense of content and timing, might be funny and encourage laughter it'll never make someone <i>like</i> buddy comedies.<br/><br/>What I mean to say is that you can't design for taste or particular emotional responses to particular structures. A structure might be sexy or funny but it can't make everyone experience as such. Nor should it. Which is my point. <br/><br/>It came up in a thread of mine where I was asking about sex and sexiness as a theme in game design and a few commentators say that they didn't like, want or need in their games thus it wasn't a matter of design nor should it be. My position is the opposite: I can't anticipate ones affective response to a games content, but I can design towards particular narratives and themes (romance and sexiness). I don't know if my designs might actually turn anyone on, but it can force narratives about BDSM or courtly love. <br/><br/>Also, Graham, and I mean this sincerely, I can't think of any RPGs that I personally find creep inducing or amusing. I mean, sure 3:16 is existentially snarky and some of the narratives in my AW game have been unsettling but I'm not sure there is a spot in the rules of those games that encouraged that. I could be dead wrong though.<br/><br/>But I guess it begs a further question: do particular narrative structures favour some affects over others? In line with what you're saying, the answer must be yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309442/#Comment_309442" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T00:40:07+00:00" title="January 25, 2011 12:40AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you ever tried the ashcan of Acts of Evil, Nathan? That game still scares the hell out of me. <br/>A game can easily kick you out of your comfort zone (and Paul Czege's games often do) and are designed to convey emotions rather than narrative genres (or themes, I use the two terms as synonims if that's ok with you), in my opinion.<br/>That way lies the story now paradigm. Games that make you put something of yourself in the fiction you create (i.e. play unsafe) are games that make you respond emotionally to the narration, and the game's system codifies which emotions the narration is going to involve, and that's much more powerful than the genre the game makes you explore, which is just a medium, a tool, not the goal, at least the way I see it.<br/><br/>So in the case of Acts of Evil, narration is going to get through the occult and dark horror genre, but the aim of the game is, if I understood it correctly, making you as a player feel a deep empathy towards your character's victims.<br/><br/>So my point is: the emotional responses you have for a game are not a byproduct of the genre you explore through the game. The theme is rather the medium through which the game makes you experience the emotional responses it is designed to spur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309447/#Comment_309447" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T01:21:22+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  1:21AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is like saying that Roller Coaster's aren't designed to be exhilarating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309450/#Comment_309450" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T01:28:46+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  1:28AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tazio, I agree completely.

A "spot" by itself is nothing, structure exists in the relationships and constellations of individual bits. There might not be a single explicit spot that does something, but the game design as a whole does.<br/><br/>We can't design for particular emotional responses because people respond differently to different things. I'm sure that if there was a scene of a parent dying in a game it would affect one of my friends a lot more than others.<br/><br/>We can design for specific stories, tones, genres, themes that provoke a <i>general</i> response. I think it's hard not to feel certain things when, say, the narrative of a My Life With Master unfolds.<br/><br/>By way of comparison: you can't film a movie and be certain you'll get a particular emotional response from all the spectators, but we have horror movies to scare us, romantic comedies to make us feel better than we are, ponderous movies that make us reflect on life. RPGs are not movies but people probably won't play Graham's purist ToC scenarios to laugh or Fiasco to feel afraid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309456/#Comment_309456" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T02:27:22+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  2:27AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I can phrase my OP in a different way, in regards to Rule Zero: if I find a scene in <i>Acts of Evil</i> very funny and burst out with laughter, is the game broken in some way?<br/><br/>My answer is: no, it's not. Nor does that make <i>Acts of Evil</i> a funny game.<br/><br/>My point maybe is that a design that promises a theme (which are often tied to affect) and doesn't support that theme rigorously is flawed. However, if one doesn't not find a particular horror game scary, that doesn't mean that game hasn't supported its theme. The inverse is also true: one could be scared during a horror game whose theme is weakly or poorly supported. Affect is not a test of a game. <br/><br/>And Gregor, totally picking up what you're putting down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309457/#Comment_309457" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T03:56:34+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  3:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to introduce a distinction between the game design and game mastery levels of management here. I think it's totally fine to consider emotional responses to a game while you're designing it\u2014and in fact, since any game will provoke an emotional response, one ought to consider emotional responses. I should probably have been more specific in the line you quoted, Orly: I was thinking more about being a GM and noticing that one player in the middle of a Vampire game, say, wasn't having as much fun, and trying to fix that problem with rules calls, possibly system-bending ones. I don't really consider that kind of fix "design"; it's more GM business and rules legislation. In mid-game we deal with players' emotional responses with extra-systematic considerations first of all\u2014using our social skills. In game design we deal with players' emotional responses with systematic considerations first, because we deal with everything with systematic considerations. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309459/#Comment_309459" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T04:29:54+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  4:29AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>We can't design toward particular emotional responses to play experience ...</blockquote>"We" certainly can! I have done so many times, in both modern and classical games. I have received the emotional responses I planned to get from the players, again and again. <br/><br/>It's all about how much you know about being a human, the human body and soul, and how you incorporate this knowledge in your game design. Humans are fairly similar, especially when it comes to emotional responses, which are hardwired in our subconscious animal mind. Push the right buttons, and the players will have access to deep emotions in concordance with the fictional content of the game, and they will be able to draw on these emotions to deepen their immersion in the character they play.<br/><br/>Adult players are able to do so, while at the same time being fully aware of doing this as players in a game.

You set up a game to evoke, to set up a situation, to enable the players to more easily create and manifest that emotion. <br/><br/>The actual emotion in the moment though, that's not the designer, that's the players. A good designer sets it up for them to bring home -- or, in other words, sets up a structure that players will invest with meaning and thus gain an emotional response too. <br/><br/>Which makes me agree with Luke and the OP both at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309642/#Comment_309642" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T21:20:36+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  9:20PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand gets it. <br/><br/>Design -&gt; Genre/Theme/Structure ~&gt; Affect; and not Design -&gt; Affect. <br/><br/>Control stories not people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309659/#Comment_309659" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T23:39:18+00:00" title="January 25, 2011 11:39PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan: you have to bear in mind the origin of our discussion here:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>We can't design toward particular emotional responses to play experience; we can design towards particular narrative structures.</blockquote>The answer to this one is clear; we certainly can design towards particular emotional responses.<br/><br/>However; we may rephrase the original assertion: <i>We can't design emotional responses.

That's the part I get. But isn't that just a more elaborate way of saying "My game controls the emotional responses of my players?" Certainly no system will perform with 100% consistency, but to me, that's a given.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible for a game to do this, and is a good thing for a game to try to do. Why make an RPG at all if not to make a system that creates a very particular experience?<br/><br/>I think a previous poster was right in saying that there seems to be a couple of different usages of "control" floating around. Perhaps we should clarify by saying "dictate" and "elicit" instead of just control.<br/><br/>No game can <i>dictate</i> a specific emotional response - that requires far more psychological manipulation than I've seen in most RPG's - but all games do aim to <i>elicit</i> one or more specific emotional responses. Further, your game <i>should</i> aim to elicit a specific response (or set of responses), and the best games are the ones that elicit those responses reliably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310084/#Comment_310084" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T12:30:10+00:00" title="January 28, 2011 12:30PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group never laughs harder than when their poor dumb characters are terrified beyond belief.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_310092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310092/#Comment_310092" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T13:43:43+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  1:43PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing is as funny as sheer. utter. beaver terror ...<br/>- in the right (that is: wrong) game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310517/#Comment_310517" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T20:49:11+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  8:49PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is possible to manipulate a particular emotional response within a game. However, this depends on how tightly the game is woven with the presented story. My best example is Gray Ranks, the Bully Pulpit story game of WW II. The story is specific, and the mechanics reinforce the emotional situation of children forced to watch their friends and themselves whirl down the drain of despair, madness, and death. Its is an emotionally-wrenching game, and all of my crew agreed while it was a great game, that it would be difficult to play again because of the way it made us feel.<br/><br/>In Steal Away Jordan, your character's worth is the price he would get on the auction block.<br/><br/>In 3:16, what appears to be a mindless shoot-em-up game teaches you that actually part of the Bad Guys as the game progresses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
