Most rpg settings are not useful for me because they're choked with excess detail that I cannot connect to any practical play procedure, but not so with Carcosa: what is there is highly relevant. The bits I don't like (the dice conventions, mostly) are easily ignored. My only major complaint is that in Geoffrey's stead I would have organized the encounter material differently: as it is, many of the hex encounters are more appropriately random encounters, and the book does not comment upon regional features as much as it could. This is purely a "I could have done better" type complaint, though - perhaps I will some day, and meanwhile I have the luxury of adding whatever I see fit to the impressive foundation of Carcosa.<br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to use Carcosa on play yet, but it does lurk in the background: when characters do planar travel they might stumble on Carcosa by accident, and just last session there was at one point a goodly 15% chance that the history of the game setting would be erased by snakemen and replaced with Carcosa. So it does carry its weight in our campaign, if only as a lurking meme around the edges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370965/#Comment_370965" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T14:07:08+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  2:07PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2012 2:07PM by AlexMayo.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aesthetically I think it's incredibly beautiful.

The speeches these men have reduced me to tears, they inspire billions of people, literally billions to better themselves, their community and the entire world.<br/><br/>When I play a RP I want to be able to fight (not necessarily combat either) and champion the right causes.<br/><br/>Without any of the worst aspects of humanity we would play RP by drawing pictures of ponies, not meeting challenges such as social engagement to challenge leadership of the unjust tyrants, and lots of games center around personally confronting brutal treatment.<br/><br/>You just have to think about what happens in 3rd world nations like Sudan to understand the implications of monsters, and you know what they are not grey like in our world, they are pure white, and pitch dark, actual other-world monsters.<br/><br/>I do not want these things on our Earth, but that is the very reason I want them in a game, to discuss and reason (even if my characters do not) the motivations and implications of such actions.<br/><br/>And that means as a DM I include these things, I know the maturity of players, I have DM'd with preschool children, and they can understand these concepts, they are not hard to comprehend. They are hard to live with.<br/><br/>Though I use very simple and plain language, and never "describe" an action such as sexual assault. It is a highly subjective matter. You can just call them "bad" slavers if you want, but everyone knows what you mean, they are killers. You can say the troupe encounter a woman assaulted and abused with torn clothes, and mature players know that she would have just been raped, but that is totally different to glorifying these actions by focusing on the negative.<br/><br/>Try to focus on the positives!<br/><br/>Sorry for the rant and interruption but I thought that there was a very clear reason why these motifs and actions occur in a fantasy game, we all want to be heroes. And we do that by overcoming evil.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371026/#Comment_371026" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T17:38:18+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  5:38PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Carcosa is pure metal, and hits the sweet spot for old school Sword &amp; Sorcery for me. <br/><br/>You've got a fantastic world, which is gritty at the human level.

I suggest we put Carcosa to the Anna Kreider test.Is the Anna Krieder test the test where we ask which of these quotes belongs to Anna Krieder and which belong to Phyllis Schlafly? <br/><br/>A) "That being said, harem anime is pathetic and disgusting. Fetish anime ditto. Hentai anime ditto. "<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> "Is there ANY reason for us to see Imrijka\u2019s (far left) hugely inflated sphere boobs? No."<br/><br/>C)   (after the following exchange)<br/>Zak: "You said: "Do I want Hyun Tae Kim to stop making art now and forever? No "But you say you're "against" it. What then are you suggesting he himself actually do? Or that other people do about it?Are you just saying he should keep making it and people should just keep complaining about it until he's unpopular?"<br/><br/>Another interlocutor: ""I won't presume to speak for Wundergeek, but here's my own thoughts on the question of how to deal with people who like this stuff.It's really an issue of context, in my mind. Under some contexts, what they're doing is clearly unproblematic (eg. the BDSM subculture, which from my understanding is very concerned about issues of consent and meta-consent despite the lack of consent being a turn-on), and under some contexts, it clearly is (eg. the jerk who really doesn't care whether partners are hurt or not, as long as there aren't legal repercussions).It's really impossible to say which group the people who like HTK's artwork fall under, so we can only roll our eyes at their bad taste.HTK himself, on the other hand, is much easier to condemn, because his choice to aim his artwork at an audience composed largely of young males whose lust for compromised female bodies is not anchored by a strong foundation of respect for women's meta-level wishes implies that he doesn't see a need for context in the first place.What should be done about it seems to follow naturally from the idea of context \u2014 kick it out of the mainstream, where it's likely to be misinterpreted, and allow it to be provided in spaces where the necessary context is known and agreed upon. That's probably still not ideal for its fans, but the level of harm that could be done by it seems smaller than the level of harm done by the perpetuation of consent brinksmanship."<br/><br/>Her: "Yes. That"<br/><br/><br/>D) All of the above to Kreider.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/>What she knows about people who aren't her could fit between a thumb and a thumbnail. If she's the standard then my whole group is "disgusting" for appearing in pornography, my girlfriend is "disgusting" for appearing in photos with her completely inflated (but real) sphere boobs gratuitously exposed (and enjoying hentai), and I should be 'condemned' (like Hyun Tae Kim) for making my paintings and/or attempting to distribute them anywhere other than in some little "safe" community.<br/><br/>Someone who basically doesn't admit my friends' right to exist and would deny me my means of livelihood should not be the standard for anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371090/#Comment_371090" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T02:19:07+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  2:19AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're remarkably het up about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371091/#Comment_371091" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T02:23:40+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  2:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>You're remarkably het up about this.</blockquote>Oh hells yeah I am.

People call Dogs "that game where you play Mormons and shoot gay people!" like it's supposed to be a whish fulfilment fantasy that celebrates Mormonism while what you actually do in the game is realize how terrible it all is. Or Poison'd which everyone knows as "the game where you necrorape a boy's esophagus" and they make the link between playing that person and <i>wanting to be that person</i>. Nobody thinks Anthony Hopkins is a monster because he played Lecter or that Orwell was a totalitarian, right?<br/><br/>Now, I don't know Carcosa enough to judge which side of the line it falls on or if it's actually offensive or anything, but there's a clear line between a certain society or structure or morality existing in a game/work of fiction and endorsing that line of thought. <br/><br/>From what I <i>do</i> know of Carcosa I don't find it problematic. I also find the setting compelling, vibrant and inspiring. I don't care for the dice mechanics in the least.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: One could always pull the argument that 1984 can be used as a blueprint for creating a real dystopia but then we're entering into "ban everything" territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371105/#Comment_371105" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T03:41:19+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  3:41AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2012 3:45AM by GB_Steve.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>You're remarkably het up about this.</blockquote>Oh hells yeah I am.
