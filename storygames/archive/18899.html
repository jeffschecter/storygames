Great times! We all agreed this was a great session. To recap, we have four players: me, Dawn, Pat, and Geoff. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18515/tsoy-bringing-down-the-pain-is-a-pain" rel="nofollow">Here's where I talked about our previous session</a>.<br/><br/>In prepping, I was having trouble coming up with Key Scenes. We were nearing the end of the current chapter (Maldorean army tries to seize a valley from a ratkin tribe), and I didn't know what else I wanted to see. Then I realized (with Pat's help) that I wanted to see the end of the chapter. So I just made that a Key Scene: "5 XP for ending the current chapter". Ok, now I was ready! Once the chapter was over, we could all discuss what we wanted next.<br/><br/>I was also concerned about Dawn. Dawn hadn't done much to advance her own character, and she didn't seem to have a play agenda. As one example, in a previous session she wanted to find some treasure in an abandoned village. I had nothing planned, so I had her roll an Ability (Theft, maybe?). I hadn't planned anything there, so when she succeeded, I asked her what she wanted to find. That threw her for a loop! She had trouble understanding that she had creative power.<br/><br/>When I spoke to her recently, she complained to me that Pat and Geoff were leading stories that didn't interest her. Instead, she felt I was "an awesome story teller and I want to delve in your head." She was looking to me to provide the story, and she was expecting to go along for the ride. Dawn and I had played D&amp;D together many years ago and I was always the DM, so I realized (again with Pat's help - smart guy, Pat) that she was going back to those play assumptions unconsciously. She had even selected Keys that looked like a trad RPG:<br/><br/>Glittering Gold: find the loot!<br/>Conscience: save the helpless peasants the DM will surely send<br/>Curiosity: find the clues to the DM's plot<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to do about this. Then I found an old post of Eero's where he talked about <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=29637.0" rel="nofollow">protagonists vs. supporting characters</a>, and it all made sense to me. Dawn wanted to play a supporting character - she wanted to simply express someone else's creative drive. Since she said she really liked my ideas, I thought of creating an organization that she could join, and they could order her to hook into another character: "Spy on that elf, find out what he's up to and report back". We could then see how she adapted as time went on.<br/><br/>Today while we waited for Pat to arrive, I asked Dawn and Geoff what they wanted moving forward. We all agreed that we wanted more social actions and political intrigue, and we should move to a city for the next chapter. Dawn also mentioned her continuing struggle with creative power, referring back to the above-mentioned treasure hunt. I shared my thoughts with her, and she agreed with my analysis - she had created a D&amp;D character. That may have inspired her actions later (See below!).<br/><br/>Then we had our session and it rocked hard. The army showed up and threatened to use explosives to seal the ratkin in their caves. Dawn got mad, because she was tired of this army trying to enslave the helpless ratkin. I made a huge tactical error by placing the army commander in the cave entrance, where Pat's goblin used Destruction magic to collapse the entrance and separate the commander from his army. Uh oh.<br/><br/>Dawn bought off her Key of Pacifism (at Pat's suggestion), bought the Secret of Sudden Knife, and stabbed the commander in the back. While he lay there bleeding, she Swayed him in BDTP to withdraw his army and give up his mission of conquering the valley. Pat took the opportunity to Transcend his goblin wizard, announcing he would stay with the ratkin to found a school of Destruction magic. He also incorporated the other PCs, by teaching them "the essence of Destruction", which they used to buy Secrets.<br/><br/>Dawn announced she wanted to end slavery and free slaves everywhere, and she bought a Key for it. She had "so many ideas" for her character, which tells me she wants to be a protagonist now. I might still provide the organization for her as I had planned, but she won't be leaning on it for support. <br/><br/>This session was really instructive to me. I like TSOY in part because it looks so similar to D&amp;D 3E on a surface level, but the differences wildly change the game's feel. That's great because it reminds me how little changes can have huge impacts. But the downside to that is someone can start playing it with some assumptions (often subconscious) and they don't get it. They're looking for the DM's plot to follow, rather than creating their own. The solution is to give them something to hang on to while they find their feet, and keep giving them opportunities to inject their own ideas.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422786/#Comment_422786" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T23:49:30+00:00" title="October 12, 2013 11:49PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice to hear about how your play is progressing.

Now they can make a new one (building on the heritage of their old one if they want to).

Can you give me an example of a "muzzy fuzzy" transcendence?<br/><br/>I felt that the transcendence was a little tacked-on, because at that point the climax had finished and the major conflict had been resolved. This was Pat's way of retiring the character (he already had a new character concept in mind) and changing the world, which was good, but I would have liked him to also end a conflict. Not a big deal though.\n<blockquote>To me it seems that you have this particular detail well in hand, but I'll say it anyway: sometimes Story Guides slow down in between chapters instead of speeding up, and this can cause lost momentum in a campaign.

We decided we wanted to move away from the wilderness and combat, and go to a city with political intrigue. Dawn's character is Ammenite so she decided to return to her homeland and emancipate some slaves. Pat's new character is Khalean so that's perfect, and Geoff also has a new Ammenite character in mind for after he retires his elf.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422794/#Comment_422794" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T12:22:20+00:00" title="October 13, 2013 12:22PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not sure what you mean.

I like it when players embrace it whenever their character's ready for it, and if that happens without an important conflict at the hand, or as an afterthought to the important conflict, then so be it. (I call this a "bittersweet" transcendence in the SS text, if I remember correctly.) The mechanical limitations on when to transcend are really much more like demands to transcend ("Now! Now's the time, do it already!") than forbiddance to prevent you from doing it. Players err much more often by putting transcendence off, rather than by doing it too early, and the rules reflect that.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
