(It's not that logical from an economical standpoint because the metal is slightly weird and it's not the local tender, but there is like a black market that can use it.) And some will be angry.<br/><br/>So the trigger for the move is "When you offer glitchworld currency, roll [????]. ???"<br/><br/>We don't typically roll for social situations (we're moving more and more to a DramaSystem/D&amp;D 5e mashup). The move is supposed more of a randomizer of the particular merchant's pre-disposed attitude -- and instinctual reaction -- to the glitchworld money. It's like "frowned upon" but it's still money. It should be risky to offer it I think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446723/#Comment_446723" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T16:28:25+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  4:28PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless you wish to apply some character skills (for persuasion, I'd presume) to the process, it'd be a straight roll, no +, right?  Your stats have no bearing on someone else's pre-disposition.<br/><br/>As far as outcomes, I'd guess a tier system like this (in more concise fashion) would work:<br/><br/><b>10+</b> This person values glitchworld money for its relative scarcity, thinking that once the public loses their fear of it, it'll be worth more than gold!  They are unable to hide their zeal, and you negotiate to pay half-price (relative to normal currency).<br/><br/><b>7-9</b> This person would rather be paid in normal currency, but will accept your glitchworld stuff (for a slight markup if you track currency closely; otherwise, never mind).  Once the transaction is done, however, they'll take steps to ensure that they or their area aren't seen as a glitchworld-friendly place of business, as they don't wish customers like you to scare away their regulars.  They'll rat you out to whoever's most convenient.<br/><br/><b>6-</b> This person thinks that using glitchworld stuff makes you an enemy of the people.  They will immediately attack if their odds of defeating you are plausible; otherwise, they will immediately seek out someone else who will take you down.<br/><br/>I dunno how valuable this type of specificity is, though, when you could just use AW's Seduce/Manipulate to resolve whether you get what you want and how costly it is, and then color in the details on the fly as befits the particular glitchworld dynamics you're aware of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446726/#Comment_446726" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T16:39:47+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  4:39PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks good, love that 10+ result.
