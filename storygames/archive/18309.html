'To do it, do it' and 'if you do it, you do it' take its place. The MC is not the arbiter of whether what you want to do obviously just succeeds or if it warrants a roll. The moves do that for us, with their perfectly non-ambiguous (jk) fictional triggers. If you seize something by force, you roll to seize by force. Yes, even if the MC is all 'well it's much more interesting if you succeed and knock him over, what would even happen if you didn't get hold of that thing?'<br/><br/>'Say yes or roll the dice' was a concept that solved a problem for me \u2013 it states that if a conflict or action is not interesting, skip over it. 'If you do it, you do it' can, depending on the move trigger, bring back the rolls for uninteresting actions. The key point is 'depending on the move trigger'. In order to make a good move, the trigger must completely cover any and all situations where that action is interesting enough to warrant a roll, and no other situations.<br/><br/>When this works, it solves the same problem as 'say yes\u2026'. What happens when it doesn't make sense to fail, for example when attacking someone defenceless? Well, the Hack and slash move (from DW) says 'When you attack an enemy in melee\u2026' and a defenceless enemy isn't in melee, are they? 'When you seduce or manipulate someone', when the group has the same mental model of what manipulating means (which is hard to achieve), is the same. If you're just talking, we don't roll. When you've got the kind of leverage to call it <i>manipulation</i>, that's an interesting situation where we let the dice decide.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>What made me post this is the discussion about Dungeon World's Spout Lore move <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/412674#Comment_412674" rel="nofollow">over here</a>. I can think of a lot of situations where it's maybe not impossible but at least very tricky for the GM to think of a good hard move on a miss. Situations that aren't interesting. Where I as a GM would like to go by 'say yes\u2026' and just give them whatever their accumulated knowledge ought to be; at least what I (given my prep about the world) consider to be common knowledge in the realm. But no \u2013 if we go strictly by 'if you do it, you do it', you have to roll.<br/><br/>For the combat example, this is built into the trigger nicely \u2013 situations where I as a GM would have just 'said yes' are pretty much covered by the qualifier 'in melee'. With spouting lore it's not that easy. There are way more situations where I would not have called for a roll if it were up to me, but that still go for that trigger. With a certain reading of the move, I completely understand the GM mentioned in that thread, who didn't let his players roll to Spout lore.<br/><br/>I'm not writing this to critique DW in particular. I think generally the basic moves of all published AW hacks I've played hold up pretty well. But this is something that I think deserves mention when people start creating new moves. If you're playing RAW (which maybe no-one does), the move has to make the 'say yes or roll dice' decision for you. When you write a move, the onus is on you to get that trigger right.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Maybe this 'say yes\u2026' vs 'to do it\u2026' is a false dichotomy; it's probably a bit of a sliding scale. But I still wonder \u2013 <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a>, was it your intention with the AW engine that the triggers on the moves should (ideally) serve as the judgement for what warranted a roll? Normal caveats like 'it's your game, do as you like when you play' aside. If so, how much thought went into the triggers \u2013 did you have this in mind?<br/><br/>How about designers of other AW hacks \u2013 did you ever go over the basic moves to make sure they wouldn't trigger when no roll was actually needed?<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>'Go aggro' has been subject to quite some debate since AW was released, and I think it's because the trigger is vague. I mean, 'going aggro on someone' evokes a certain feeling but exactly what are you doing? I've definitely been in fights rolling 'seize by force', thought of meanings of 'aggro' (aggro range of monsters, being aggressive\u2026), and thought 'yeah, I'm aggro right now' (NB: I'm not a native speaker). I've seen advice going 'well, look at the 7-9 list. If none of those even make sense, you're not going aggro.' That's clever \u2013 interpreting the trigger so that it triggers when the move would give interesting results!<br/><br/>Maybe that's the solution. Don't care too much about getting the triggers right \u2013 define the move from what it does. 'When you do x, y or z happens'. Well, if I'm doing x and neither y or z seems plausible obviously the move isn't for this kind of x-situations.<br/><br/>Then again, advice for 'acting under fire' says 'If you really can't think of anything to do to the player on a 7-9, pass it up. They caught a lucky break.' (not exact wording). This supports the idea that if you're acting under fire, you roll the goddamn +cool, cause the move says so.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>If you take as a rule that the moves determine what's an interesting situation to roll for, they also start informing the fiction in a subtler way. If we decide that the Spout lore move is part of our game, we have decided that 'consulting one's accumulated knowledge of a subject is potentially dangerous, <i>every time</i>'. It decides a priori (with no knowledge of the particular fiction) that in this story, when people start thinking about what they know, that's a dramatic situation. Just like Hack and slash decides that attacking someone in melee is. It's just, that one isn't so far from our frame of reference so we don't think of it that way.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if it's allowed to 'say yes' instead of rolling the dice, the moves become watered-down guidelines instead of hard rules. It's possible to attack someone and agree that yeah, this li'l kobold is not even a threat to you, don't bother rolling. That's not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 it's just a different mindset.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Obviously I make this sound like a bigger deal than it is. If you find yourselves in a session of someone's hack and realise that the move would have you roll for something completely uninteresting, with no interesting options for either outcome, I guess you'd just skip it. I'm still interested, however, in hearing designers' thoughts on this. I've only played AW, DW and Monsterhearts, so that's my frame of reference.<br/><br/>Is there a solid thought behind the idea that 'if you do it, you do it' should <i>replace</i> 'say yes or roll the dice'? (In games that use it of course, not in every game.) Or is that simply something I've made up?<br/><br/>Do you even get what I'm talking about here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412795/#Comment_412795" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T14:20:39+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  2:20PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In AW, I think it says explicitly in the rules that if a PC has his gun to an NPC's head and pulls the trigger, you don't need to roll the dice for that, it's done and the guy's dead.

But also, the AW system collapses down (in onion layers, as Vincent describes on Anyway) so that if you forget to roll for something, you're missing out on a part of the game, but it's no big deal; the game still functions.<br/><br/>The core of AW is a conversation between the various players about what happens (totally functional, by itself). Then the GM's agendas, principles, say alwayses, and moves are layered on top of that (which creates a totally functional diceless system for play). Then the player's stats and moves and gear and other stuff are layered on top of that (creating the full system). But there's always the basic conversation and the diceless core functioning beneath the layer where dice are rolled. <br/><br/>It's not a big problem if you don't roll dice when you're supposed to! The principles and other stuff will carry you through (though you may be missing some aspect of the game). But sometimes it's a problem to roll dice when you're not supposed to (i.e. when there's no fictional trigger), because then the stuff you're supposed to do afterwards may not make any sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412804/#Comment_412804" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T15:28:49+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  3:28PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

Sometimes the results and consequences will be obvious.  With no uncertainty to resolve, don't roll.  When there's uncertainty, roll.  (Or, I should say, <i>interesting</i> uncertainty.  If no one cares, <del>also don't roll</del> don't play through it, just skip ahead.)<br/><br/>As for extreme likelihoods, like "I'd say there's a 1% chance this would work" or "I'd say there's a 99% chance this would work", I believe the recommended solution is to hand the GM the responsibility for honoring the fiction.  So if I try to shoot an NPC point blank in the head while they're dazed, and I roll badly, the GM might narrate how I do in fact blow off their earlobe as they lurch to the side.  If the group cares about the percentage discrepancy between the fiction (1%) and the dice (e.g. 42%), then either this isn't the game for you, or start adding in situational modifiers (+3 for being super easy).<br/><br/>When the results are obvious but the consequences are not, I <i>think</i> you have the following option: roll fails, action succeeds, horrible consequences ensue.  I blow the NPC's head off but am instantly shot by their enraged compatriot.  But I might be botching a rule on that one.<br/><br/>As for "what to do if the roll fails?", to me that sounds like a problem worth solving rather than dodging, because I'd expect it'll come up in situations where we really want to roll.  It's basically a GM skill, in my opinion.  Learn the principles, look over the hard moves, and be creative.  Personally, I think "During the time you spent doing that, bad stuff occurred" is easy to throw into random situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412807/#Comment_412807" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T15:48:39+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  3:48PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what Jonathan said. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412812/#Comment_412812" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T16:40:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  4:40PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this was exactly Vincent's intention, but I think the advantage is in excising the problematic "is this interesting?" question.

I'm much more comfortable with categorizing: no, that's not melee, that's just sticking a knife in someone because it doesn't have the other features of melee. Instead of <i>judging</i> the fiction you're <i>interpreting</i> it. The game focuses your attention at particular times and places and asks you to find what you're looking at interesting (with the expectation that there's probably enough there that you <i>will</i> find it interesting, and even if it isn't initially interesting your brain will fill in enough details to <i>make</i> it interesting when you focus there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412815/#Comment_412815" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T17:48:46+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  5:48PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2013 5:51PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan's 100% correct too.

AW and DW don't ask you to make decisions about whether something is interesting or likely. Honestly, AW/DW don't give a crap about that.

The game cares about people playing under the expectation of the rules. As far as the player's go its to play their characters as real people (bad ass or adventurous, but real). This covers the whole 'to do it do it' adage and the moves that ensue. (which may or may not be interesting) But what about the other moves - The GM / MC moves? The interaction at the table, the conversation of roleplay involves the GM invoking their moves as underpinned by their agenda and principles - subtly manipulating the player's choice of narrative and subsequent move triggers.\n<blockquote>Part of following the rules is making moves. Your moves are different than player moves and we\u2019ll describe them in detail in a bit. Your moves are specific things you can do to change the flow of the game.</blockquote>\nThe GM / MC should stick to their principles and agenda; notable in this instance being the admonition to <b><b><i><i>embrace the fantastic</i></i></b></b> and <b><b><i><i>be a fan of the characters</i></i></b></b>.

When you do something under fire, roll +cool. (The MC will...) Call for this move whenever someone does something requiring unusual discipline, resolve, endurance or care.<br/><br/>I don't see how that can be done without a judgement on the MCs part about 'requiring unusual' 'care' or 'resolve' or 'discipline'. I see it as kind of self-defining that if nothing interesting is at stake then the action can't require unusual amounts of anything.<br/><br/>Or to put it another way, I don't see say yes as 'not applying'. It's more like the principle of say yes is built into the move as part of the decision on whether to trigger it.<br/><br/>So maybe one way to look at moves from AW and DW is of lots of helpfully pre-defined 'say yes or roll the dice' moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412867/#Comment_412867" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T10:04:23+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 10:04AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2013 10:10AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> : yes, "success"+ a hard move on a failed roll is totally a valid *World move, and sometimes necessary, in my experience. Those have been some of my favourite moments in play, actually.<br/><br/>I'm reading this and looking forward to some more responses.<br/><br/>My experience with these games is that the OP's dilemma is a very real one. I consider it a flaw in the design of these games (AW and relatives, which I enjoy a great deal): sometimes it's really not clear which is the better way to go. It says, "if you do it, do it", but sometimes it makes more sense to apply other principles (like "say yes or roll the dice", which isn't an AW rule, but still often useful in a game of AW).<br/><br/>The best solution I can think of is mentioned above: some combination of "follow the MC principles" (e.g. "is this making the PCs' lives interesting?"), and "let's play it a few different ways and see which is most fun for our group".<br/><br/>It's better if you look at the rules and procedures as a painter's palette of paints and brushes. Which one you use at any given time is a question of art or skill, based on the effect you want.<br/><br/>Someone's sneaking up on an enemy, and they want to stab them in the back.<br/><br/>It sounds like we should roll "go aggro" here, but actually it would be more fun for everyone if we treat it as an "act under fire" roll. And maybe the next time the MC simply decides to "look through crosshairs" and "inflict harm": the target is dead, no roll needed. <br/><br/>There's room there for different interpretations, and that's a huge part of where an MC's art and skill comes into play.<br/><br/>The best advice I've seen for deciding which to do if you're really not sure is as follows:<br/><br/>A. Keep asking questions about the fiction. Establish exactly what's happening, how fast, when, what it smells like. <br/><br/>Chances are good you'll pretty see why a certain move is better than another, based on something someone playing says. <br/><br/>For instance, maybe the player says, "I'm terrified that the guard dogs around the corner will hear me struggling with the sentry!"<br/><br/>Cool, then I as an MC would probably choose to "inflict harm" (the sentry's dead! blood everywhere!) and ask the player to roll to act under fire, to see if she can take out the sentry without attracting the attention of the guard dogs.<br/><br/>B. Whenever you're not sure what to do as an MC, it's your turn to talk and everyone is looking at you.<br/><br/>This means: time to make an MC move. Look at your list and pick something. "Announce future badness" and "offer an opportunity" are very good general-purpose moves for such situations (along with asking questions, as mentioned above).<br/><br/>When people start playing AW there are often these moments where the MC gets an itch, like, "Oh, man, I really feel the need to roll some dice right now." <br/><br/>But none of the moves match. What do you do?<br/><br/>Make an MC move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412869/#Comment_412869" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T10:06:59+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 10:06AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So maybe one way to look at moves from AW and DW is of lots of helpfully pre-defined 'say yes or roll the dice' moments.</blockquote>\nThat's a cool insight.

They just answer questions, describe and sometimes follow instructions, like filling in boxes or picking things from a list.<br/><br/>The only mechanical autonomy PCs have is those moves that let them spend hold anytime. Oh, and Sex Moves. You can always decided that the sex was non-consensual and the move won't trigger. But that's an answering a question and describing thing again, even.<br/><br/>While a canny Player might describe themselves towards certain Moves, it's always the MC that makes them.

The point I'm trying to make is that when committing to the total set of moves (I'm pretty much only talking about basic moves), it's up to the one who wrote those moves to ensure that they trigger at the right times. When I as an MC decide that 'these are the available basic moves', I've committed to not calling for Hack and slash when it's not a melee, and conversely to always call for Spout lore when what the PC does can accurately be described as 'consulting their accumulated knowledge on something'. Acknowledging that the trigger clearly has/has not been met, and then going on to not call for/call for that move to be rolled, is against the rules as written.<br/><br/>Of course there are custom moves, but using those to systematically fiddle with the basic moves' triggers is pretty much hacking the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413072/#Comment_413072" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T11:29:41+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 11:29AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Acknowledging that the trigger clearly has/has not been met, and then going on to not call for/call for that move to be rolled, is against the rules as written.</blockquote>\n100% Agree.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413086/#Comment_413086" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T13:33:48+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  1:33PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Acknowledging that the trigger clearly has/has not been met, and then going on to not call for/call for that move to be rolled, is against the rules as written.</blockquote>\n100% Agree.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI'm really curious about this!<br/><br/>How many of you actually play the game this way? Vincent states in the rules that "if you do it, you do it" (meaning roll for the move already!). However, some of his examples go against this.<br/><br/>In the games I've played and run, I've always seen moments where a move is being made but the move doesn't get triggered. <br/><br/>A simple example:<br/><br/>-"Ok, I offer Ambergrease the slaves after all, and demand that he leave my holding alone. I'm going to manipulate him!"<br/>-"Don't bother rolling! There's no way Ambergrease would turn that down. He agrees to the deal!"<br/><br/>So, in my experience, players and MCs of *World games DO take the absence of conflict as a guide on certain occasions and don't ask for the move to be rolled under those circumstances.<br/><br/>Another simple example:<br/><br/>-"I stick my gun in his face and yell at him to hand over the goods! I'm going aggro, right?"<br/>-"With that big gun? Hell, no. He hands over the goods IMMEDIATELY. Might have pissed hisself, too."<br/><br/>What's your experience like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413097/#Comment_413097" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T13:59:22+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  1:59PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 2:02PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, so like, in both those examples the MC is making an MC move instead of a Basic Move, even though the player is <i>expecting</i> a Basic Move to Trigger.<br/><br/>In both those situations, the MC is <i>disclaiming the decision to the NPC</i> and not to the dice. Then, I'd expect that MC to follow it up with a Move. Maybe like, announcing some badness.<br/><br/>Pragmatically speaking, I'd have the players roll in both those situations. My favourite, favourite thing is having NPCs suck it up. <br/><br/>Also, like, that first one is already a diceless Move - when you ofter 1-barter you don't need to roll, you automatically get a 10+ on seduce/manipulate.

Maybe even more hardcore than Vincent.<br/><br/>So, like, there's going to be some fiction positions that can reasonably be interpreted as a qualifying trigger for multiple Moves. I would say this happens like, pretty much all the time. <br/><br/>Your role as the Master of Ceremonies is to bear the primary responsibility of adjudicating specifically which Move is ultimately triggered. It is your call, by fiat, and always in accordance with your Always Says and your Agendas and your Principles, etc etc. You're the Judge, you interpret the letter of the Law, and hand down sentencing. If that didn't require difficult and messy interpretation, we wouldn't need either lawyers or half of the criminal justice system. It'd be automated. But life, and fiction, is messier than that.<br/><br/>It's not "is a Move called for?", it's "which Move is called for?" <br/><br/>Sometimes it's <b>Announce Badness</b>, <b>Go Aggro</b>, <b>Seize by Force</b> or <b>Inflict Harm (as established)</b>, but the the fictional trigger is identical, like putting a gun in someone's face. A Move is always called for, which one specifically is called for is up to the MC. If you not making a Move as an MC, you're asking questions and listening to the answers. Then either you ask more questions or make a Move.<br/><br/>If that gets under your skin as a facilitator, don't be the MC. <br/>Or maybe play a different game. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413117/#Comment_413117" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T16:26:43+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  4:26PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 4:27PM by DannyK.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>In the games I've played and run, I've always seen moments where a move is being made but the move doesn't get triggered. <br/><br/>A simple example:<br/><br/>-"Ok, I offer Ambergrease the slaves after all, and demand that he leave my holding alone.

Otherwise, I think you're on a slippery slope where the GM is deciding when we're rolling dice and when we're just talking, and AW isn't supposed to work like that.  That said, I suspect that many GM's drift the game in this way, since that's how role playing games mostly work.  <br/></blockquote>\nActually, I don't really agree here. As Orlando says, the MC is always deciding what move is called for, and whether it's a basic move, a playbook move, or an MC move. "When a player's character hands you the perfect opportunity on a golden plate, make as hard and direct a move as you like." (p117). If you want to respond to the player offering Ambergrease the slaves with "take away their stuff," well, that's a pretty solid opportunity, don't you think? For another example, check page 170, where Uncle makes an organized retreat, and the MC responds by offering an opportunity with a cost. He could just make Uncle roll to act under fire, but he doesn't -- he gives him a choice to do something else. It's not always obvious from the text, but the MC has a lot of leeway to decide what counts as what move. Once you've decided that, then you get into "if you do it, you do it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413121/#Comment_413121" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T16:50:10+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  4:50PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 4:52PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew, I thought I had slipped into an alternate universe where the book was published without the Master of Ceremonies chapter. <br/><br/>Yeah, go read every single word in it, like a couple of times even.

That's who he is, so you're not manipulating him by proposing he do exactly what he wants to do. You are just telling him you won't stand in his way." With these statements, I am establishing what the word "manipulate" actually means. Perhaps this is my MC style ever time I MC, but it doesn't have to be. All it means here is that for the rest of this campaign, with these characters, this is what "manipulate" means (or doesn't mean, in this case). When this happens again with another NPC, the players will expect (even demand) that this interpretation remain in place because this is how they understand the rules of this conversation and they are playing towards this understanding.<br/><br/>But when we start a new campaign, it is possible to clear that whole slate and go back to the RAW and re-interpret it anew. Maybe this time I, as the MC, say "no, this time every deal is a manipulation, so you have to roll, no matter how much they want what you offer them." So we have a new interpretation of the word "manipulate" for this campaign, this conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413148/#Comment_413148" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T21:20:43+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  9:20PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 9:26PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I see it as a failure of the design of the basic move.

Otherwise, less great.<br/><br/>Am I reading that correctly?</blockquote>\nI would kind of agree, but I'd make another point here, which is that it's important to understand that the basic moves (and all moves) have both situations and prerequisites.<br/><br/>This is in the book for one of the examples for manipulate. For the specific move in the book, at least, manipulation always requires leverage. But leverage is an intentionally nonspecific concept! In order to apply this basic move at all, the MC must apply judgement and decide what qualifies as leverage and what doesn't. It's in the process of doing that that the use of MC moves to respond can come into play.<br/><br/>Similarly, you can't seize by force without force, you can't go aggro without something threatening, etc., etc. If I try to seize your tank by force with my plastic fork, sure, there are situations where that might work, but I doubt that most people would be satisfied with the conclusion that because I said "I'm seizing by force with this fork!" I get to roll for it the same as if I had a howitzer. In every case, it's up to the MC to decide whether the situation qualifies for a basic move in the first place. I don't think the game would work any other way!<br/><br/>In fact, this is really just another way of looking at "to do it, do it." If you can't do it, well, you can't do it. And the MC (and the story, of course) is responsible for answering the question of whether or not you can do it. I feel like this whole discussion is kind of an evolution of this basic principle.<br/><br/>edit: Also, "Make Apocalypse World seem real."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413232/#Comment_413232" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T18:32:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  6:32PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still curious whether anyone (Johnstone?) has actually played AW this way.

So, you're not skipping over anything. And it's a hella of a lot different than either Seizing or Going Aggro or Acting Under Fire or Indomitable.<br/><br/>I mean, sure, play with time and scene framing. You might be building this weird straw man playstyle in your head where we play out everything in maddingly minute detail, action by action, moment to moment looking for triggers with autistic devotion and exactitude. But also, I don't know what you're talking about.<br/><br/>In MC chapter, it talks about this I think? Example time.<br/><br/>I mean, if a PC is like okay I want to break into the local hardholders lair and assassinate him, and they describe setting out at night to the compound. It's got guards and shit. Whatever. <br/><br/>As the MC I draw a fucking detailed-ass map with every hallway and guard patrol route, and we play out every moment to moment, action to action scene of sneaking in and killing the holder, like D&amp;D style. We talk about cover, and lighting, and the patrol routes, and the locks, and the number of concubines and service staff, and if the slaves are likely to narc, and  the materials of the walls and the weather. This would probably trigger a dozen rolls at least. <br/><br/>I can describe it broad strokes, adjudicating on a scene by scene basis, maybe only calling for two or three rolls. Like, a couple of Reads, a couple Acts, and one Seize, maybe. And like, a Fuck This Shit at the end or something.<br/><br/>I can call for one roll, Seize by Force, and adjudicate the whole mission with one roll.<br/><br/>Or, once the PC is finished describing them setting out, I can cut to them standing over the hardholders dead body, with the Skinner, terrified and naked weeping over it. I don't call for any rolls.<br/><br/>Vincent's been writing about this sort of temporal framing and 'zooming in and out' since at least <i>Dogs</i>. It's on page 121-122 of AW. He calls it <i>eliding the action</i>. It's not actually a rule or principle or anything, just a suggestion.<br/><br/>I mean, I can't think of a situation where a trigger is clearly met but that I wouldn't go to the dice if I wasn't implicitly making an MC/Front/Custom/Threat move or something else. I mean, even if I have like an idea of how as scene is gonna go down, say a negotiation, and the NPCs wants are pretty clear and the PC is like basically gonna give them what they want (which is like, okay, how the fuck did that even come about from following my principles?), but there's always a chance that things might so sideways. So, the roll their Seduce/Manipulate! Which is good because they might get to mark XP and we all get to play to find out what happens and I as the MC get to make things not boring.<br/><br/>I'm playing the Angel in Daniel's (IceCreamEmperor) game right now and my Angel kit was low on stock. So, I need to go buy stock with the oddments that the Brainer owes me. I go in to the commons and we make like the Shopping move, but I only get a partial, which means that we have to go talk to Dustwich, because she's buying up all the stock, because Twice the local holder is in a fight with Oola the crazy raider queen, so I have to negotiate with her, but we end up having this big scene over tea where I'm angling not to get totally fucked by Twice's gang but also buy the stock but also I'm spilling all of the beans about the shit that went down with Wisher (who works for Twice) at the Infirmary that morning but also I'm learning about other political shit and I only get a partial so Dustwich is all 'I'll sell it to you, but I want you to come hunting with us, so you can be a battlefield medic.' And I'm like fine, but I want to bring the Brainer, and she's like 'no he's too important to die,' so now instead I'm bringing my sixteen year old daughter Mox. <br/><br/>So, yeah, I guess we could have skipped the shopping scene and not made that roll. Except that handful of rolls dramatically changed the course of the plot and revealed a ton about the characters and their relationships.<br/><br/>TL;DR<br/><br/>Roll the dice, it's part of how you play to see what happened and hella adds to your characterization and plot and shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413296/#Comment_413296" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T13:33:41+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  1:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, I think you're reading way too much into this.<br/><br/>"Eliding the action" is part of it.<br/><br/>The other part is what we're talking about:<br/><br/>I'm asserting that sometimes the fictional trigger for a move is made, but instead the MC just makes a move.

I don't think it wouldn't work--the game would be fine, because the moves are good--but I've never actually seen anyone play a *World game that way. ("That way" means without ever eliding the action, framing past certain moves, or just making an MC move like "Inflict Harm" instead of rolling the move.)<br/><br/><br/>(A related question is whether the MC can or should just "say yes". I'd say that's totally fine so long as the reason the MC is saying yes is part of making her next move, or so that she can move on to setting up her next move. But I'm not as 100% sure on this one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413301/#Comment_413301" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T14:30:45+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  2:30PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2013 2:37PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm asserting that sometimes the fictional trigger for a move is made, but instead the MC just makes a move. (As you described, above.) In other words: <i>It often happens that the fictional trigger for a move takes place, but the move doesn't get triggered.</i></blockquote>\nYeah, Orlando might be saying that is legit? I'm saying I don't play this way except by mistake.<br/><br/>So, in the playtest draft, it seemed like it said that if you just shoot a dude, like "you see Balls down the street, looking the other way," and the player's like "fuck that guy, I'll take a shot" that was NOT going aggro. In the finished game, the sniper example seems to make it clear that yes, that IS going aggro. Except this is not explicit, so there can be some confusion about it. Much like there is much confusion about seduce/manipulate vs. go aggro vs. seize by force. So now it's pretty much "go aggro and maybe he has to choose between dying and taking the harm except that "dying" just means taking the harm." You might still kill them on a miss, but no, replacing go aggro with inflict harm is not a legit call for me as an MC, but other MCs have to make their own decisions.<br/><br/>When I MC, if you make a move by the standards of my definition of the move's trigger, you roll for it. If somebody else at the table thinks you made a move, we listen to their reason and consider it, and if I think it's a move, you roll for it. If it's a peripheral move, we discuss whether we want to use them and if we do you roll for it. As far as I remember Daniel and others MCing, it was the same then too. MC moves do not replace basic or special moves.<br/><br/>Scene framing is for the beginning and ending of scenes. I don't skip sections in the middle of a scene. There is occasionally abstract time where we say some stuff happens but don't role-play it. Those are not scenes. Moves that happen in between scenes of in abstract time do not count, you don't roll for them, and you don't get any mechanical bonus from them. Only fiction. If you complete a workspace requirement to build a thing in abstract time that is okay because it is all fiction. If you do a thing that gives you +1 or 1-hold, fuck your +1 you want it you get it in a scene where you roleplay. Exceptions will be considered but aside from setup moves (Fortunes, Wealth, etc) are few and far between. Other MCs are less strict about this, though.<br/><br/>If no move is triggered, the MC can just "say yes," for sure. Or "no," or "how is that, exactly?" or "sounds a bit like act under fire with the fire being ..." or "lemme write a custom move and we will roll for it." Adam Koebel would do that last one on occasion, hence my total not-surprise at the final version of defy danger in DW.<br/><br/>Also, to be fair...\n<blockquote>we play out everything in maddingly minute detail, action by action, moment to moment</blockquote>\nIt happens sometimes, sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413303/#Comment_413303" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T14:44:17+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  2:44PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is why the move triggers are like "go aggro" and not "shoot a guy."<br/><br/>Sometimes shooting a guy means the MC makes the inflict harm move. Sometimes it means you roll to go aggro. It's always the MC's judgment call, since the fictional trigger is not "shoot a guy."<br/><br/>So, yes, when the trigger occurs, we roll the move, BUT the exact fiction that triggers the move varies from case to case. In other words, there's no rule that says we roll aggro every time you shoot a guy, but there is a rule that says we roll the move every time you go aggro.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413305/#Comment_413305" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T14:57:51+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  2:57PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2013 3:14PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I addressed this already up thread:\n<blockquote><br/>So, like, there's going to be some fiction positions that can reasonably be interpreted as a qualifying trigger for multiple Moves. I would say this happens like, pretty much all the time. <br/><br/>[..]<br/><br/>It's not "is a Move called for?", it's "which Move is called for?" <br/></blockquote>\nIn practice, I prefer making basic/playbook moves as an MC when the PCs trigger them, rather than MC moves if both trigger. That's part of not weaseling them. Prefer doesn't mean always though. <br/><br/>Sometimes you shoot a dude and it's Inflict Harm or Take Away Their Stuff or Announce Badness and not Go Aggro or Seize by Force.<br/><br/>But yeah, we generally roll for it.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm in complete agreement with Johnstone (and John Harper), and yeah, mostly we play zoomed right in and make tons of rolls in a small amount of fictional time. I think the game really shines here, because like you say, the moves are good.<br/><br/>I think the only real disagreement is your framing a playstyle in some pure way, where the MC never elides the action or makes an MC move. Of course that's impossible. But what I think Johnstone and I are saying is that you should use those things sparingly and stay close to the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[AW][AW hacks] Say yes or roll dice; or simply roll dice? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18309/aw-aw-hacks-say-yes-or-roll-dice-or-simply-roll-dice/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[AW][AW hacks] Say yes or roll dice; or simply roll dice? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18309/aw-aw-hacks-say-yes-or-roll-dice-or-simply-roll-dice/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I'm asserting that sometimes the fictional trigger for a move is made, but instead the MC just makes a move.

You say:<br/>"Sometimes you shoot a dude and it's Inflict Harm or Take Away Their Stuff or Announce Badness and not Go Aggro or Seize by Force."<br/>But there's no move, MC or basic, that goes 'when someone Inflicts Harm, Inflict Harm as established'. The trigger for MC moves are always the same:<br/>\u2013 Everyone's looking at you expectantly<br/>\u2013 You just got handed a golden opportunity<br/>\u2013 Someone rolled a miss<br/>\u2013 Another move told you to<br/>Those are the triggers for MC moves. So the whole 'overlapping triggers, the only judgment call I'm making is deciding which one to do', is when one of those four overlaps with some basic or playbook move. And if you want to be that way, I guess most cases when the player says 'what I'm doing here, that's going aggro, right?' will also fall under 'everyone looks at you expectantly'.<br/><br/>But yeah, I'm with Johnstone here. The basic move got triggered -&gt; you roll the basic move. It is not free for me to make an MC move instead because it happened to make the same thing that just happened. The MC move Inflict Harm is for deciding 'harm is inflicted here', it is not something new that happens based on the trigger 'harm is inflicted'.<br/><br/>Sometimes the shooting of the dude is, on closer inspection, not any character move. Then it most probably calls for an MC move. Although the shooting itself being a case of an MC move? That means something else triggered that MC move first. When a player has their character shoot a dude, I don't think that shot can be an MC move. I mean, it was the player who made it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413310/#Comment_413310" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T16:08:13+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  4:08PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm getting the feeling more and more that we're talking about something we totally agree on but having an argument about anyway.

So how about a different example. How do you see this example of mine, earlier:\n<blockquote><br/>Someone's sneaking up on an enemy, and they want to stab them in the back.<br/><br/>It sounds like we should roll "go aggro" here, but actually it would be more fun for everyone if we treat it as an "act under fire" roll. And maybe the next time the MC simply decides to "look through crosshairs" and "inflict harm": the target is dead, no roll needed. <br/><br/>For instance, maybe the player says, "I'm terrified that the guard dogs around the corner will hear me struggling with the sentry!"<br/><br/>Cool, then I as an MC would probably choose to "inflict harm" (the sentry's dead! blood everywhere!) and ask the player to roll to act under fire, to see if she can take out the sentry without attracting the attention of the guard dogs.<br/></blockquote>\nHow would you handle this "by the book"?

And it's been established that Ambergrease is shooting, a decent shot, has an AK, and AKs are 3-harm ap. <br/><br/>I don't think the MC would be amiss in making the move Inflict Harm (as established). That's the move I would make. Ambergrease isn't threatening Grip with violence, she's actually just committing it. And Grip is probably surprised and not really in a position to fight back, so it's not Seize by Force. <br/><br/>So, as the MC, I say, "Sure, the AK kicks hard into your shoulder, pulling a little to the left, but you've been using this puppy so long that you expect that, so you handedly put the first two rounds in Grip's chest and shoulder. She crumples to the ground, dead." <br/><br/>I mean, if Ambergrease was like "Shove my nine in Grip's face, yelling at her to telling me where the fuck Mox is. I'm Going Aggro, right?" As the MC I'd be like, "Yeah, no shit. Roll it."<br/><br/>The Players are always looking at your expectantly because they can't say any beyond what their character is doing. You ask them 'What do you do?' and they tell you, and then look at you expectantly. <br/><br/>I mean, really what I find at the table is that I'm constantly having to inject into the Player's responses with things like "That's totally Go Aggro, or Seduce, or Acting, roll it." Just staying on top of the basic / playbook moves is usually enough.  I turn to my MC / Threat moves usually on misses but also, whenever there's a rare lull in the conversation - or, you know, when the player's hand me an opportunity to do so.<br/><br/>I know this is like a conversation about MCing, but like, truly the game pretty much runs itself. If you do all the 1st session stuff and all the front stuff, most of your job we will be portraying the world and the NPCs and making Moves on Misses.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413313/#Comment_413313" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T16:17:38+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  4:17PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm getting the feeling more and more that we're talking about something we totally agree on but having an argument about anyway.

Balls down the street can make that choice once you start shooting. That sentry standing guard can make that choice once you touch him with the knife.

If I could get all the players to buy in to that, I'd love it.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's an odd feature of my particular gaming group, but our authority for invoking a move seemed to derive from the group's collective parsing of the rules, rather than from the MC's personal judgment.  In other words, if a player's narration was deemed by the group to count as a Move trigger, but I as MC wanted more information before the dice were rolled, and the player didn't want to keep roleplaying, I was over-ruled by the majority.  I was content to view this as a social and aesthetic issue, not a rules-adherence issue, and cede to the group.<br/><br/>This brings us back to the original topic of this thread.  I think there's room for reasonable difference of opinion within a group about when to roll the dice.  "I sneer at him.  I glare at him.  I loom over him.  I yell at him.  I cock back a fist.  I put my hand on my gun.  I draw my gun."  When exactly did I Go Aggro there?  There's room for interpretation, and accordingly, there's room to slide up and down the scale of what any given player finds interesting.<br/><br/>I think, just as Dan said, that the Basic Moves do a great job of telling the group what's interesting, on one level, as an ingredient of "why we're playing this game" and setting expectations about where to invest our interest.  But on another level, there's no getting away from a certain amount of player vetting.  The triggers simply aren't objective enough for "roll a move exactly when it's triggered; no more, no less".  We can agree to interpret broadly (whenever you might roll, roll!) or narrowly (that's no contest; that's impossible; let's skip over that), but I think it's an open question as to how much "we judge that to be interesting" does and should factor in.\n<blockquote>Exclusively!</blockquote>I interpret that p109 text to mean "no other player can say what your character says, thinks, feels, remembers and undertakes to do."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413426/#Comment_413426" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T13:46:58+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  1:46PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The player says, "I go aggro."<br/>The MC's proper response is, "Okay, cool.

You ask the players for more details, and they look at you like you're making them do something unpleasant. "Look, I'm going aggro. I've got my gun. I'm rolling for it."<br/><br/>Go Aggro is actually one of the best cases here, because we can't go ahead with the move until we know what's being threatened: we need to establish at least a few details, like what the character wants, and what harm they're threatening. (Although in the book there's an example of this not happening, and being handled with a retcon. I think we all agree that's not the optimal way to run the game, though.)<br/><br/>I think one of the things about the design that really <i>doesn't</i> help with this issue is:<br/><br/>Some of the moves are written so that they do not require any in-fiction action. (Or can be used very easily without any narration, so if someone forgets to add something to the fiction, no one will notice.)<br/><br/>Especially moves like:<br/><br/>* Read a sitch<br/>* Spout lore<br/>* Stat substitution moves or similar mechanics-only moves<br/>* Certain playbook moves like Hypnotic, Dangerous &amp; Sexy, Visions of Death, etc.<br/><br/>It's really easy with some of these to get into the habit of just saying, "I'm using move X" and then rolling for it.<br/><br/>In comparison, something like "go aggro" requires for us to establish some fiction first (like how you threaten the person, what you want from them, and what you're threatening them with), so it's much less likely to just go straight to the die roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413483/#Comment_413483" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-03T12:52:10+00:00" title="May  3, 2013 12:52PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes! To keep bringing the same point up: the basic move should take responsibility for when its trigger is fulfilled. With those moves, you bring it back to the player by effectively allowing them to just say they do the move and it's done. While it's possible to write a move that triggers on concrete detailed action and still calls for a roll at the wrong times, moves without such prerequisite action always allow for such rolls to happen. All it takes is that the player wants to roll for it at the "wrong" time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413485/#Comment_413485" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-03T13:02:54+00:00" title="May  3, 2013  1:02PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2013 1:05PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm.<br/><br/>If we're playing AW (for the first time, say) and they go, "I go aggro" and I go, "Okay, cool, how?" and they go, "I don't know. I point my gun, whatever. I just want to roll it," then that's where I pause and talk about how to play AW. Because that's not how you play it.<br/><br/>If they're all, "I don't want to say stuff about what I do, I just want to roll the move," and they're really adamant about it? I guess that's it, then. We need to play a different game, because they are clearly telling me that they don't want to play AW.<br/><br/>"Playing Apocalypse World" includes "say what your character does in the fiction in order to roll a move." That's not a weird gray area. That's the game. If someone thinks that doing that is unpleasant, fine, but for heaven's sake play something else.<br/><br/>Even doing the bare minimum there ("I hold my gun to his head or something,") is hardly worth it. We're there to bring the fictional world into vivid life together, through an exciting conversation. Boring and disinterested conversationalists need not apply. It's not my job as MC to cater to every possible player.<br/><br/>[And yes, I know, this is the cliche Story Games response. (You have a problem? Play something else!) But I don't know how else to put it. This problem is the <b>core of AW game play</b>. If the core activity of play is not what they want, why on earth pick this game?

I guess the player is kind of being a dick at the beginning.  At the same time, he does eventually contribute, and it could be argued that the MC is now being unfair for not calling for the roll right after "You wanna die, punk?!"  My intent was not to posit a spoilsport, but rather to show that there's room for reasonable disagreement.  If I want a little more fictional vividness and the player wants a little less, or I want it now and they want it later*, we may not agree on precisely when to roll.<br/><br/>*"later" is a bad match for Go Aggro, but works for Reads, and players may get in that habit and enjoy it ("Rolled an 11!  You have to force my hand or cave, huh?  Well I'm getting this crazy look in my eye that says if you force my hand I'll show you whole new kinds of pain!").<br/><br/>Having said all that, it does occur to me that even the <i>most</i> concretely-triggered actions do still have <i>some</i> amount of this vulnerability.

The game actually just doesn't work if you don't say what you're doing, because the MC has to look at the fiction to make decisions. You don't have to get moralistic, just say "Look, I don't know what to do based on that. I need to know what happens to know how the NPC responds."<br/><br/>edit: If they are giving you enough information to act, but you feel like you want MORE information, that's a different problem.

(Go Aggro is a good counter-example: if you don't say what you're doing, we're going to have a hell of a time trying to play it out.)<br/><br/>"Visions of Death" is a perfect example of a "mechanical" move. You can just notice that, "Hey, it looks like we're getting into a fight, yeah?", then roll the move, tell the MC who lives and who dies, and that's it. We move on and keep playing. No one's actually said anything which adds to the fiction, but the game keeps chugging along.<br/><br/>It's VERY easy for people to do this without even noticing they're doing it.<br/><br/>What happens next? That's when the problem starts.<br/><br/>So then, when the next move they have to make is "go aggro", the player gets confused: they expect it to work the same way. It becomes a habit, a particular way of engaging the system. (Especially because it's "easier"--requires less effort--people start to default to it.)<br/><br/>At least that's what I've seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413513/#Comment_413513" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-04T13:02:21+00:00" title="May  4, 2013  1:02PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2013 1:13PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Paul, that's true.

Any external signs?"<br/>"I cry tears of blood when my gaze falls on someone doomed to die."<br/>"Whoa. Yes. Awesome."<br/><br/>If you get into the habit of not asking, and the player not saying what they do, the game slaps you when you go aggro (or whatever) and reminds you that it's not the way to play. I assume that most people can learn that lesson, adapt, and get better at the game.<br/><br/>I'm not saying "this isn't a problem," because it is (some moves have less "teeth" as you noted). I guess I just don't see it as a huge deal that's difficult to overcome, more like part of the learning curve of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413515/#Comment_413515" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-04T15:00:42+00:00" title="May  4, 2013  3:00PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2013 3:10PM by lumpley.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't fall for it, John! This thread is some rabbit hole nonsense.<br/><br/>Going aggro works perfectly well if all you say is "I go aggro. I want him to get out or I'll shoot him." This is just the same as visions of death: you name the move so everybody knows what's happening, and you provide the information it requires so that the MC or your fellow players can make the decisions they need to make. The moves are about information and decision making, not about description or narration.<br/><br/>If as MC you're curious about (for instance) what exactly they say, or what it feels like, or what it reminds them of, or whether blood falls from their eyes, then by all means ask. You should ask about whatever interests you! Of course you should and why wouldn't you?

Sounds to me like the basic trigger for a move is "whenever someone feels like making that move; provided they can supply the info that's required to complete it".  Whether you wait for a trigger from the fiction to initiate that process is up to you.  If you do choose to look for fictional triggers, there will indeed be some judgment involved regarding when exactly in the flow of narration the roll should be made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413529/#Comment_413529" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-04T23:07:23+00:00" title="May  4, 2013 11:07PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm pretty satisfied with this thread.

And the 'getting info' moves are sometimes close to this but haven't really needed changing for me so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413531/#Comment_413531" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T01:55:41+00:00" title="May  5, 2013  1:55AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In theory I am the only one; in practice maybe 50/50.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413539/#Comment_413539" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T04:52:23+00:00" title="May  5, 2013  4:52AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2013 4:53AM by lumpley.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I can't go along with that!<br/><br/>1. I didn't say it was in the group's hands, I said it was in yours, the MC's. Don't hold the move hostage, no. Instead, ask them what you want to know and just wait for them to answer. The game can't continue without you.<br/><br/>If that becomes an occasion for headbutting in your group, you've got problems that Apocalypse World's game design won't solve.<br/><br/>2. Your "whenever someone feels like making that move; provided they can supply the info that's required to complete it" is "to do it, you have to do it." The other basic trigger for a move is "if you do it, you do it."<br/><br/>If I say "I tell him to leave and I'll shoot him if he doesn't," I've provided the information required to go aggro, so I'm going aggro and I should make with the dice. Anybody can point this out who feels like it, but as MC, it's your particular responsibility to do so.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413547/#Comment_413547" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T10:21:54+00:00" title="May  5, 2013 10:21AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Vincent and I have probably identical visions of how the game is played. It's a matter of articulating it on the Internet that is a challenge sometimes (for me, anyway <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>The "occasion for headbutting" that Vincent describes, above, is what I was trying to get at, I suspect. The game invites the MC to ask questions of the players, and make their lives interesting (to the MC). If the MC follows that instruction, and a player doesn't want to participate, there's a problem. (One the game can't solve, as Vincent said)<br/><br/>In terms of rolling the dice, yes, if someone says "I tell him to leave and I'll shoot him if he doesn't," that is totally sufficient to roll go aggro.<br/><br/>The example given by Paul was "Look, I'm going aggro. I've got my gun. I'm rolling for it." This is a bit vague for my tastes. Vincent's example is brief, but covers what we need (What you want and what you'll do). Paul's example isn't quite there, and I'd ask a question to clarify before calling for a move. (But not because I'm <i>supposed to</i>, like it's some kind of chore. Because I want to, as MC. It's part of my job -- to be curious, to bring the fictional details to life -- and I <i>want</i> to do that job, which is why I signed up for it)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413548/#Comment_413548" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T10:44:08+00:00" title="May  5, 2013 10:44AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep!<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413549/#Comment_413549" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T11:01:31+00:00" title="May  5, 2013 11:01AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some time soonish (this year, I hope) there will be a nicely-edited video of Vincent and I playing AW together, with some other old hands.

It sounds to me like we're describing the same process, just focusing on different parts of it.  We may differ on the line between "headbutting" and "reasonable disagreement about how much detail is desirable", but it sounds like we're both saying that the MC can ask as they choose, and the players can answer as they choose (right? if they give perfunctory answers, they're not "playing wrong").  Accordingly, it's up to the group, not the game, to either (a) get everyone on the same page re: how much asking and answering is desirable, or (b) don't, and live with the consequences.<br/><br/>As for "if you do it, you do it", that's what I intended to describe with "if you choose to look for fictional triggers".  And re: the judgment involved in deciding when to roll, I hear ya: anyone can call for it, but the MC really ought to stay on top of it.  <br/><br/>When I was playing, the MC almost always had to call for my moves (and sometimes did so earlier than I would have liked); another player always called for his own before the MC or anyone else did (often earlier than the rest of the group would have liked).  When I MCed, I asked a few questions that players didn't want to have to answer at that moment.  Not a huge deal, but there were a few small arguments about taste and about what "should" be happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18309/aw-aw-hacks-say-yes-or-roll-dice-or-simply-roll-dice" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18309/aw-aw-hacks-say-yes-or-roll-dice-or-simply-roll-dice" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18309/aw-aw-hacks-say-yes-or-roll-dice-or-simply-roll-dice/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18309%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18309%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
