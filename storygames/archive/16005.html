It was a really good session where we all got out our reasons for playing and what we were hoping to get out of our sessions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Had some interested requests.<br/><br/>We came down to a decision to switch systems, and "translate" the characters from World of Darkness into The One Ring.<br/><br/>Our wants: <br/>An "old school" feel of a series of adventures/encounters <br/>Sandbox/West Marches<br/>No "meta plot" + Character driven "story"<br/>No Levels.<br/>Potentially Lethal/ Always repercussions<br/>Able to influence the dice "when it matters".<br/><br/>I could probably talk a lot about each of those wants, but after our session this week where we actually played we could see a dramatic change <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I am not sure how closely we are RAW for the one ring, but we played in the following way:<br/><br/>The players were narrating what they were doing, and when they describe doing something outside the accepted capabilities of their characters - or interesting - they pull out the dice, which determine how the scenes continues.<br/><br/>The "accepted capabilities" was hard to gauge in WoD, but in ToR we found the Distinctions and Favored Abilities let the players have a good feel of when they could "just talk" and when they had to "roll the bones".<br/><br/>They wanted a trope and so went to the Tavern looking for interesting things. After a few failed courtesy and song rolls the players described themselves as a bunch of drunken louts... until one player decided to use a Lore roll to find some potential hints - and after an awesome success decided that she had met someone who was in awe of her repitation as a wise-one... So we ended up looking for historical treasure in ancient ruins (The NPC became Henri of Jonesford)<br/><br/>The game just flowed this time - the mechanic of Hope and the fellowship rules really made the players come together - the more "gamer" ones were playing the system of hope and distinctions for XP, but the result almost like watching an adventure movie or something <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The characters were acting like interesting characters in a dangerous situation without the players having to step out or think more meta as they have with FATE.<br/><br/>The traveled through a dark forest, risking hope and encountering dangers on the path (which they neatly sidestepped though clever logic). and into an old-school dungeon crawl - the Tomb of the High King - where they are facing magical traps and puzzles, and everyone was joyously adding details and practically jumping to get the next word in and have their characters doing/saying things.<br/><br/>Honestly was one of the better sessions i've had... and especially after the earlier horror of a session this was most welcome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>To everyone who gave advice, pointed me in new directions, and pointed out potential flaws in how I was GM'ing - THANK YOU!!!<br/><br/>Dionysus aka KJ.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364676/#Comment_364676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T13:44:07+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  1:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great!

The One Ring feels very 'low fantasy, low magic' setting. The setting we are using is pretty similar, but a little higher on the fantasy side (goblins/fae and strange things) <br/><br/>The only thing we are really changing is the "colour" of the descriptions, but the mechanics are unchanged.<br/><br/>We really loved the ability to "spend hope" after rolling to push those rolls that just didn't make it...  It made everyone feel a little more "heroic" than in WoD. But still know that they would be paying for it later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
