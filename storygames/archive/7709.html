Some system-based interlocking of traits is not gonna cut it.\n<blockquote>It's certainly not more effective at creating a "team of remarkable individuals" setup, which is one of the goals of SOTC...</blockquote>\nThat is, by itself, an expectation. If PTA is not letting you do it without a similar interest from others, it's doing well its work.  The equivalent in SotC is NOT the choosing of traits, it's "let's play SotC", an agreement to play a game with these fixed expectations.<br/><br/>Anyway: seeing that it's really difficult to beat the PTA method as a way to start a campaign, I think it's more fruitful to look at the method used to communicate the CHANGING of expectations during the campaign. PTA is not build for this, and it's understandable, with its short story arcs.

You can't skip series creation, but you can eaily fail to create a good series by ignoring a bunch of the advice.  You can create inert characters with Issues that keep them from actually doing anything, or you can create characters who have nothing to say to each other.  I think if some of that other advice had mechanical wrapper, it couldn't be skipped in the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171253/#Comment_171253" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T11:35:44+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 11:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, even better.

Say the setup phase allows you to choose which relationships are most important to you, or to create pre-existing relationships to use in play.  That's cool, but it carries the assumption that relationships are an important part of play for all players.<br/><br/>In tightly focused games, that's not a problem.  If you don't want to play a game that's about relationships, you don't play that game.  With a toolbox game though, this is important, because the game is intended to be drifted.  It might or might not be about relationships, depending on the group and their tastes.  If you have relationship flags, it becomes harder to drift away from relationship based play, especially if those flags are tied into the mechanics of play.<br/><br/>The same could be said for thematic flags, setting flags, situation flags, and really any other kind of flag you invent.  As an example of the way that having different goals impacts how flags might be used:  Consider a group that exhibits both D&amp;D-style Strategist tendencies and story game Radical tendencies (to pick a particular flavor of each.)  The first might be much more interested in which parts of the world they get to see, and thus want to have ways to flag bits of the setting.  The second might be much more interested in who they get to interact with, and therefore want to be able to flag either other characters or relationships with those characters.  It's the difference between "I want to explore some dwarven ruins!" and "I want to figure out what makes the royal cartographer tick, so that I can convince him to divulge the location of the ruins!"  For a toolbox style game, you'd ideally want whatever sort of flagging mechanism you come up to be able to handle both of those and a number of other cases as well.<br/><br/>The trade-off though is that, with any sort of flag, the boundaries or constraints created by connecting them to "during play" mechanics will necessarily limit the amount you can drift them.  Or, to put it another way, the more general you make the flags the harder it becomes to tie them into the procedures of play.  Yet tying pre-game flags into play-time mechanics is one way, maybe the best way, to keep them relevant.<br/><br/>It's complicated, and I'm still thinking about it pretty hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171264/#Comment_171264" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T12:21:58+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 12:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max: uh, okay but it's that all the point of flags?

On the general forge forums the limit is "you can reply to threads on the first page of a forum" (apart from high-traffic "first thoughts" where it's 3 pages) and that thread it's still on the first page of Ralph's forum.

I have a bunch of questions in the Coolmap Brainstorm section of that PDF (some of which resemble Luke's BW ones, I think more through parallel evolution than anything). I'd love to have input from anyone else on better questions to ask.<br/><br/>I left out the "mechanical impact on character creation and then play" part because it quickly gets specific to the game I'm designing, but in brief: you create supporting characters (NPCs, basically, but there's no GM in the Pentasystem) as "faces" on the main entities that people think are cool. The Temple gets a priest, the Government gets a bureaucrat or whatever. You then create links from the main characters (PCs) to those supporting characters in an R-map. In my game, these links are "motivating attributes" which refresh pools when present in a scene and also act to draw characters into conflict.<br/><br/>So when you have an NPC who's important to the PC in a scene, and they're representing an entity which was predefined as being interesting to the players, you have immediate potential conflict plus resources. When you introduce a theme off the Coolmap into the scene, you also have resources (to be used in conflict). You've flagged upfront, not just on your character but overall, what you want the game to be about, and when the game is about that, you get bigger explosions and sparklier sparkly bits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171345/#Comment_171345" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T16:50:37+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  4:50PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>Although none of the games Ryan mentioned are like that (no-GM and/or zero-prep).

The sorts of mechanics that work well for flagging setting elements are different than the sorts of mechanics that work for flagging themes.  Sure, you can write either of them on a pre-game planning sheet just the same, but when the rubber hits the road during game time, the way you handle a setting flag and the way you handle a thematic flag is going to be different.

On top of all THAT, you can have Up Cost limits for Abilities (or even per-Ability) and that will impact, generally, the "power level" of characters.<br/><br/>Thus, I think it can be enough to have modules that have a clear impact on play style or "feel," with advice on how they interrelate, if used in a mix-and-match fashion.

So they don't have a direct mechanical effect but they provide the most important lineup for mechanical effects later in the game.  <br/><br/>2)  Best interests are something you'll drift off of in the later weeks of the game.<br/>Each new session has new best interests set up - you don't have to carry best interests from one game to the next.  Your play proceeds to the next stage, with new best interests.  But the important distinction here is that best interests are NOT done at the end of the session to set up the next chapter; they're done at the beginning.  That makes them salient for this session and not prone to drifting.  Any drifting that's happening in between sessions is then either nipped, made explicit, or is irrelevant because there's a new setup phase each session. <br/><br/>Other stuff:<br/><br/>3)  The Trash example sounds like it's making my point; Shock is supporting the game featuring asked-for content and it's being taken somewhere cool by the players, but those asked-for and agreed-on elements aren't being lost in the "somewhere cool" because Shock is helping them stay in.  But if you actually wanted to flag "relationships on the internet vs. real life" would you know to choose Drug Addiction and Swappable bodies as what you're flagging?  <br/><br/>4)  If you want to support the players in flagging a theme or style you need to have something that's going to recur in play.  But I think what Joshua's getting at is that flagging this stuff can't just be a one-time thing, and I'm on board with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171464/#Comment_171464" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T09:35:50+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  9:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On rereading, this really stands out to me:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Getting games to get groups to communicate about tone and style, and stick with it, is the holy grail.</blockquote>\nIt has long been my contention that there are four important aspects (or quadrants) to think about when you analyze a topic.  Those four are behaviors, experiences, cultures, and systems.  There's a cycle, since individual's experiences shape their values, which shape the shared cultural values, which shape the systems in place, which shape the behaviors people engage in, which complete the loop by shaping what sort of experience one has.  (It runs the other direction too, but that's less relevant here.)  For roleplaying, you can roughly equate culture= shared preferences/interests, systems=design, and behaviors=play.<br/><br/>To situate what you're saying in this thread within that context, flags are a way to feed preferences/interests (culture) into game designs in such a way that the rules and structures of the games (systems) promote certain kinds of play (behaviors) that maintain interest, engagement, and investment (experiences.)  Because there is a feedback loop, the way that play evolves (like Joshua was talking about) can shift what people are most interested in right now.  What just happened affects what you want to happen next.  This sort of feedback process is present whether or not it's acknowledged by the participants, or the game they're playing.<br/><br/>IAWA handles the feedback cycle in a pretty genius way, by iterating the setup phase, yet carrying over elements from one session to the next.  And it boosts the cycle every time around by offering up some random pieces to build on, yet it lets you choose which ones you want to invest the most energy in -- an implicit flag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171470/#Comment_171470" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T09:49:38+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  9:49AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember that those random pieces you're building on are actually thematically rich, so that reinforces what you're saying about handling the feedback cycle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171474/#Comment_171474" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T10:01:21+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 10:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 10:02AM by Ry.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>This sort of feedback process is present whether or not it's acknowledged by the participants, or the game they're playing.</blockquote>At least the game should be cognizant of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171476/#Comment_171476" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T10:17:27+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 10:17AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 10:19AM by Max Higley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed on both counts.  I don't think it will too controversial, though, to say that some games fit themselves into that feedback cycle better than others -- some are more cognizant of what's happening than others, in a way.  This ties in to the ongoing discussion about how much of the load has to be carried by social agreements outside of the stated procedures of a game, and inversely, how well the game creates the certain sorts of social agreements that it needs to function properly.<br/><br/>Connecting that more explicitly to this thread, you can play, say, L5R, which has no explicit flagging, and pick up that slack by agreeing what your game is going to be about.  You're basically supplementing the effects that the game has on the feedback cycle with additional support structures, in order to create the sort of game experience you want.  (To coin an unfortunate term, you're filling the Un-Fruitful Void.)  With other games, you don't need those extra agreements about what the game is about, because the structure of the game itself provokes you to make agreements using flags, and then ties those into the ongoing process of play by making them mechanically relevant.  And some games do that better than others, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
