This would be a paying gig. Is anyone here up for it, or able to recommend someone else who is? <br/><br/>For those that don't know, Other Worlds is a trait-based game with a focus on group worldbuilding, character issues, and genre archetype stuff. It's what became of the old Questworlds project I was working on with Mike Holmes and others. <br/><br/>I want a clean, elegant layout. I am not afraid of white space. I already have all my artwork in, courtesy of Storn Cook - we've gone for loads of pencil sketches along a general theme of 'concept sketches for an imaginary film/campaign'. Some of the pieces also have handwritten text integrated in them, to create the impression that they have been torn out of some imaginary GM's campaign notebook. With the right layout this could be one sharp-looking game. <br/><br/>So... any takers?<br/><br/>Thanks for the help,<br/><br/>Mark                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336832/#Comment_336832" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T12:25:29+00:00" title="August  2, 2011 12:25PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2011 12:25PM by soviet.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, any takers on this?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336851/#Comment_336851" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T13:07:29+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  1:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would normally be interested, but I'm currently buried in several other book-length projects, as are most of the indie games layout people I know.

But fuck passable. I don't want passable, I want amazing. I've put my heart and soul into writing and (endlessly) rewriting this game, and I've got 30 pieces of fantastic artwork courtesy of Storn Cook. I need a layout that matches those standards, even if I have to wait to get it. If this game turns out to be a turd, at least no-one will be able to say it's not an extremely well polished one. <br/><br/>I stumbled across this email earlier, which is part of the original art brief discussions I had with Storn Cook. I think it's a good summary of what I'm aiming for. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By:soviet</cite><br/>What I want to do first is try and establish a general 'look' for the game. Something distinctive. Something that represents the truth of how the game actually plays. The concepts I want to really try and capture are:<br/><br/>1) The game is very much concerned with genre emulation - setting the right tone in terms of atmosphere and making good use of genre archetypes and other iconic images.<br/><br/>2) The world is created by the whole group and not just the GM. They own it, and they will continue to expand on it during play by using their narrative authority. It may not be perfect but it's all the more powerful because it's 'theirs'.<br/><br/>3) Characters are heavily tied into the setting. All of their abilities are defined in terms of either fitting in with their society (culture, profession, relationships) or standing out from it (individuality, trademarks).<br/><br/>4) Play is all about using these details to tell a story rather than simulating a world for its own sake.<br/><br/>I don't really think of Other Worlds as a generic game. I think of it as a game with a setting every bit as detailed and evocative as something like Middle earth or Glorantha. The difference is simply that the group will create this world for themselves, rather than borrowing it from someone else. My game is intended to be a toolkit for this purpose.<br/><br/>I'm open to any ideas you have about how to represent this stuff visually! The more off the wall, the better. The less like other games, the better. Personally I've been thinking of something along the lines of the following:<br/><br/>The game is all about creating detailed and evocative worlds. So those worlds should be at the forefront of the book's visual identity. We could therefore follow a handful of different campaign settings throughout the book.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alyyc85" title="Alyyc85"><img alt="Alyyc85" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alyyc85">Alyyc85</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338306/#Comment_338306" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T15:30:56+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  3:30PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i'm interested in too...<br/>\nim an italian owner of fantasy-website (www.dragonisland.it) which is specialized in pbf, indipendent games, narrative games.<br/>\nIm the designer of the website, of his e-zine and ive 2 sketches manual layouts made in amatorial way.<br/>\nIf you want to see or ask something mail me at: alyaly85 (at) gmail (dot) com                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341261/#Comment_341261" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T13:50:44+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  1:50PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, it's the first of September... any takers yet? <br/><br/>I should add here that I am looking for someone really good, ideally with a decent amount of experience.
