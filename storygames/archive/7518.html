(That's the problem I want to solve, not a refusal of the question.)<br/></blockquote>\nSo. Helensville is a town, a real New Zealand town, where my father's ancestors on his mother's side settled in (if I remember correctly) the 1860s. The ancestors themselves were an interesting lot. One of them ran away to sea at the age of 9 and changed his name. We're still not certain what his real name was, because as he lay dying he reportedly said to his children, "You think my name's Channon, don't you? That's all you know."<br/><br/>My mother now lives near Helensville and is volunteering in the town archives (yes, this is also partly inspired by the "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7434" rel="nofollow">If your mom made a game</a>" thread, thank you, Matthijs). She was telling me the other day about some of the old diaries they have there - she's cataloging their collection. She also found a hilarious book of guidance for being the "Perfect Woman" which I've offered to scan because it sounds like it deserves to be on the Net somewhere. <br/><br/>So in the game Helensville, you play a colonist who has settled in New Zealand, the back end of nowhere, in the middle of the 19th century. You keep a diary. In play, this takes the form of a blog, and you blogroll the "diaries" of the other people who are playing in the same game. (Possibly everyone who ever plays the game, since I don't see it becoming anything more than niche.) Anything those other people establish in their diaries as having happened has happened, and you can comment on it or not as you please; you may have a different perspective on it, including that they lied about it in their diaries, but it did happen in some way. As players you know what is in the other players' diaries, but as characters you generally don't  unless someone says something like, "I showed Lettie my diary today, and she was most shocked at my description of Mr Bennett". Then whoever's playing Lettie knows, in character, what was in at least that entry.<br/><br/>You have a game book with samples of real 19th-century diary entries, some guidance on being the Perfect Woman (or the Ideal Man if we can find such a volume), the names of some actual families who lived in the town, and other such background material. You have, probably, an event table which gives you things like crop failures or bumper crops, animals giving birth, the river flooding and the like, for which you roll dice when you want to. Or maybe you just pick one. <br/><br/>Remember, if someone says in their diary that the river flooded, the river flooded.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to play off each other's diary entries and achieve certain goals which you probably declare in your diary using some formula. "I am determined that I shall marry Archie by the end of the Spring", that kind of thing. All of the blog entries are in character at all times; I suppose you might communicate among yourselves by email OOC, but the game shouldn't require it.<br/><br/>You can help or feud with your neighbors, or both. You are strangers in a strange land, thrown together by circumstance. The light is different, the trees are different, the birds are different. You're trying to live as much as possible as if you were in England, but you aren't.<br/><br/>Indirectness, even coyness, is encouraged in the diary entries.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166916/#Comment_166916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T04:35:30+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  4:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds seriously great.

He also mentioned the fact that the Maoris had been systematically defeated in battle prior to the arrival of the settlers which made their settlement viable. However, the presence of Maoris within the district would still provide an interesting cultural dichotomy for the incoming settlers and a potential source of conflict (more cultural and societal than outright military). <br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168523/#Comment_168523" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T13:34:43+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  1:34PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's amazing, John.

The difficulties they had to overcome while retaining their English identity and civilisation  has impressed me for a very long time. The fact that the environment was <i>so</i> hostile and alien to them (volcanoes, disease, earthquakes...) as well as the need to both distance themselves from their maori neighbours and utilise the knowledge they held provided a very traumatic 'new' world for the new colonists.<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168995/#Comment_168995" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T13:45:25+00:00" title="September 14, 2008  1:45PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have huge admiration for my intrepid ancestors.

I have several responses, the first of which is that I'm not sure that's necessarily a problem. After all, people are people in all times and places. <br/><br/>The second would be that providing seed events and issues that are typical of the time and place would deal with that to a degree. <br/><br/>It's also possible that an outline of key events, local and world, might be of benefit, though I'm not sure how important they would be to people living in a small town. I mean, if it was round the period of World War I, obviously, it would be important, but I don't know that there was a lot happening in the 1860s that would have been that important to a relatively isolated farm community. The Waikato wars would need a mention, though.<br/><br/>If I ever do this project I'll probably discover a completely different answer to your question again in the course of doing the research.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169675/#Comment_169675" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T12:08:21+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 12:08PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/>It sounds like it could be a very interesting and enjoyable experience, even if just looking at it in terms of the historical research you'd be doing.
