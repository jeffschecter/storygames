The other is the widespread use of the proficiency bonus. <br/><br/>D&amp;D 5e Basic wouldn't be unusual if was an OSR ruleset. Character classes are vaguely like the ones in Blood &amp; Treasure, the pervasive use of the prof bonus is similar in many ways to Castles &amp; Crusades siege engine.

While the center on the playing, promoting or publishing of classic editions of D&amp;D. It has a very diffuse edge that includes fantasy games that use classic D&amp;D mechanics in different ways, non-fantasy games that use classic D&amp;D mechanics, and other older editions of RPGs. What the OSR is depends what slice the individuals. It has grown beyond anybody's ability to keep track of.<br/><br/>The reason for this is due to the side effect of the widespread use of the Open Gaming License.

We have seen all the permutations yet but it looking like roughly +12 to hit and 20 to 22 AC is about the max you see in 20 levels of play. <br/><br/>In contrast damages, ways of adding damage, and hit points increase dramatically. A powerful monster can do more damage and has a lot more hit points but is not much harder to hit. <br/><br/><br/>The implication is that a horde of orcs remains a serious threat to high level characters as they retain more than a 5% change of hitting their opponents.

It's also for "completing plot points," which could include things like somewhat open-ended moral dilemmas rather than pre-plotted railroady nonsense. Again, it's all going to come down to the GM advice chapter.<br/><br/>2) The Flaw alone, which Alcoholism is probably an example of, is probably not great fodder for adventures. But Traits and especially Bonds and Ideals really are. So it's kind of like, Flaws and Traits are used to generate Inspiration, Bonds and Ideals are used to generate plot. Potentially, at any rate.<br/><br/>3) Don't underestimate the simple power of, "I told the GM I was interested in this thing. The GM put this thing in the game. Hooray!" I think that's pretty important, even if the reward cycle could be tightened up. Remember, most trad games give at best some lip service to this stuff about character motivation, and nothing concrete. So this is a huge step in the right direction.<br/><br/>4) I'm not worried about oWoD style incoherence. The problems there were manifold, but basically boil down to the game not even being the type of game it said it was. There's no question this is a game about engaging with the standard D&amp;D fantasy tropes with mostly-standard D&amp;D type characters. The issue is simply whether our characters will be interesting or boring, and whether the adventures they go on will be entirely predictable or not. And I'm liking what I'm seeing, but maybe I'm just wearing rose-colored glasses.

In fact, many have considered it central to the game since white box, even without contrivance to propel it. There's just no system surrounding it.<br/><br/>While it's not the same as making the process mechanically intrinsic that's never been the niche for D&amp;D which is more focused on simulation/gamist ends of the spectrum, so neither is it surprising. It's also not unusual. If you think about flaws in many other games for instance you find that taking them tends to award mechanical bonuses...attribute points or advantages granting combat bonuses. In essence these 'roleplaying and story seeds' are bribes to increase odds during gamist resolutions in other areas. So it's not just a D&amp;D thing. It comes down to a difference of focus and playstyle.<br/><br/>We also have to acknowledge that this is the basic rules. The stripped down bare minimum mechanics for play. It's entirely possible we'll see more advanced rules, with a possibility (slim though it may be) for some mechanical attachments to story.

They feared 'builditis', or had other issues. Partially to allay their fears they came up with the 'choose an attribute boost instead' rule. <br/><br/>This is a significant issue for me because it maintains the power boost which was part of my initial issue with feats. 4d6 already creates fairly powerful characters. Encouraging several more attribute boosts is going to make some EXTREMELY powerful characters, which throws off our preferred playstyle (low power, common man campaigns). <br/><br/>I can see where it would be a benefit overall, since so many in 3rd and 4th preferred the higher power feel of characters. It just isn't the panacea they claimed.<br/><br/>Now, there are some easy workarounds. Use 3d6 or other lower attribute methods. Forgo the feat/attribute rule altogether.

Each increase is 2 points (1 in each of two or 2 in one). Classes gain 5-7 sets of increases, meaning 10-14 points of attribute increases. On top of 4d6. To us, 4d6 alone makes some pretty phenomenal stats, adding 14 points makes demi-gods.<br/><br/>The 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 standard array (which is a considerably lower than 4d6 generates usually) becomes say 20, 20, 16, 12, 10, 8, or 18, 18, 18, 14, 10, 8, or the more balanced (but still silly) 16, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12. Those aren't counting magical increases or racial modifiers. I don't know about you, but I consider 3 attributes at human max more than a bit OP.<br/><br/>Or look at it another way: Let's say you create a character with standard array and put the 8 into strength. Then you put bonuses in it so that you end up with a 18 Strength (again, not counting magic, race, etc). What does that really mean? Using the predominately accepted bell curve of stats with 18 being human natural maximum (supported by specific breakdowns in earlier editions) it means you went from being someone who standing military pressed a max of 90lbs (not a lot, but not a weakling) to pressing 480lbs (very close to the world record). Another way to see it is raising your IQ from 80 to 180. Even if we broaden the curve to put 20 as the human max, it's still reachable (with 2 points to spare). There's fantasy, and then there's immersion breaking lunacy.<br/><br/>Again, there are easy workarounds, but the point is that hacking/modding the defaults is necessary to serve (what is in my experience) a fairly broad demographic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435484/#Comment_435484" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-19T12:47:28+00:00" title="July 19, 2014 12:47PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Phoenix I don't think I buy into your criticism at all; you're referencing ideas from past editions that the ability scores were meant to correspond 1-to-1 with reality.

I also didn't like that when you were forced to choose between two options in your class, you couldn't go back later and take the other option you missed.

The game pulls back from minis and battlemats, yes, but \u201ctheatre of the mind\u201d is not an adequate description of where the game happens:\n<blockquote><br/>Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions.

Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurerers' actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is one of the features that make this game D&amp;D and not some other thing.

As a successor to previous editions it is expected (by many at least, and most I've ever met) to carry on the ideas already established. Editions aren't entirely new games (or rather, they're not SUPPOSED to be). They're supposed to be mere revisions/evolutions. I don't buy D&amp;D to get rolemaster, or mouse guard...I buy it to get D&amp;D; i.e. fundamentally the same game that it was was previously, but expanded and with fixes.<br/><br/>Now, I realize that 3rd and 4th broke with that tradition somewhat, and 5th is still questionable. However, when they make a game with the purpose of 'going back to the beginning' I expect them to follow through. Anything else is a failure against intended purpose. <br/><br/>The entire use of 3d6 to generate ability scores hinges on normal distribution across the population. The basis of D&amp;D attributes is 3-18, with 10.5 the apex and 18 being normal human maximum (albeit, with a departure in 2nd for % exceptional strength). There is an enormous body of work from basic/1st/2nd which discusses this, and gives specific relative metrics.

Many of them have been little more than map-and-key products. And these rules explicitly say that you will use them.<br/><br/>Here, in this specific text, we are not talking about a random set of numbers that stick out as implied from the rest of the rules. We are talking about the majority of chapter 8. The entirety of pp 63\u201368, and large parts of what follows (Food and Water &amp; Resting) are movement rules or rules that follow from movement. And pp 70\u201371 in chapter 9.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435532/#Comment_435532" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-20T22:04:48+00:00" title="July 20, 2014 10:04PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2014 10:06PM by phoenix182.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>for a huge swath of the community D&amp;D (and in fact most roleplaying) has always been 'theater of the mind'. Maps can have value, but aren't intrinsically necessary to the game. That was a big upset over 3rd, and especially 4th. Large segments of the community who had never bothered with such things suddenly feeling like it was almost a necessity (and really, it was pretty close). </blockquote>\nI think you're conflating "grid combat" with "maps" here.
