Personally, I'm not convinced.</blockquote>\nI wanted to discuss this article and talk about the pros and cons of various death systems here.<br/><br/>I think 4e's death system is rather inelegant. There are two ways you can die: reaching a negative hit point number equal to your bloodied condition, or failing three death saves once you are in the negatives. I think negative hit points are, in general, inelegant, too.<br/><br/>I think that 4e's goal of making death exciting and tense is only partly realized. I wish they had allowed characters to take fatal wounds that do not stop you from playing. Waiting for your initiative to come around so you can make your death save isn't that exciting. <br/><br/>Is death even an important part of the game? On the one hand, you need a strong feedback mechanism to reinforce good play. It's a strong Gamist design and it needs positive and negative reinforcement for certain behaviors. Is death the right "punishment" for poor play, especially when there's so much luck (many d20 rolls) involved? When a character dies, doesn't the player just make another? If you make up a very similar character as a replacement, does the loss of continuity of the character in the fiction provide a strong enough punishment?<br/><br/>Obviously, the 4e design makes it harder and harder to die as you level up your character. This is because you've invested more in that character and it's a greater loss. <br/><br/>If the design is doing everything it can to make death a "speed bump" for characters but still provide tension in play, maybe death isn't the answer after all. I'd rather see a system of penalties that provide color and quest opportunities.<br/><br/>Here's an example implementation of what I mean. A character "passes out" when she reaches 0 hit points or below. Enemies can perform "coup de grace" attacks and <i>think</i> they're killing the character, but inevitably the character wakes up after an extended rest. Any character who dies gains a limitation like the following:<br/><br/>Painful Limp<br/>Effect: Your speed is reduced by 1 square.<br/><br/>Foggy Vision<br/>Effect: All ranged attacks suffer a -1 attack penalty.<br/><br/>Scar Tissue<br/>Effect: If you roll a 5 or below (before modifiers) on a melee attack, you drop your weapon.<br/><br/>The player gets to choose the limitation from a big 'ol list. A character can remove any limitation with a quest. The player and DM should agree on the quest at the time the player chooses the limitation. If the player doesn't like the quest, he can choose a different limitation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174755/#Comment_174755" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T10:54:15+00:00" title="October 13, 2008 10:54AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like the old Necromunda serious injuries chart.

I do like the "left for dead" thing where monsters stop attacking you when you go down, but otherwise they're pretty vanilla old-school. I'm pretty surprised to hear Rob say they were considered a big overhaul internally. And making a 1-in-20 roll to see if you get back up on your own is just silly.<br/><br/><i>Poison'd</i> has one of my favorite death rules. When you take a deadly wound, you make a bargain or die. You can bargain with a surgeon, with God, or with the Devil -- and bargains carry mechanical weight in the game. Or you can choose die, to try to become a ghost or move on to final judgment and the afterlife. All of those present interesting outcomes and story material for the character, without simply returning to the status quo of "you recover."<br/><br/>I think collecting limitations can be a real issue for a game where you're going to fight and "die" as much as a D&amp;D hero does from level 1 to level 30. By level 15, you'll be keeping track of so many little penalties it'll get pretty cumbersome, I think. Still, a collection of battle scars of some kind would be pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174761/#Comment_174761" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T11:16:48+00:00" title="October 13, 2008 11:16AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2008 11:17AM by Adam_Dray.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you hold onto your limitations until you satisfy the quest OR level up.

This included some in PHB and many from splat books.  Some that were about being tougher (feeling less pain), interacting with the undead etc.  I then ruled that if you died, your next feat had to be a "Returned Feat".  The idea was that instead of forcing "hindrances", death simply "shaped what sort of advantages" you could have.<br/><br/>We also all agreed that continually raising from dead was boring story.  We agreed that usually "death" was really "near death".  You suffered the same mechanical effects (essentially lost XP) from "near death" but narratively you had never died.<br/><br/>I see the 4e death rule as trying to (a) posit some simulationist validity [well of course if you take 50% again of your hit points you're a smear on the ground] and (b) some traditional, random but not completely arbitrary "suspense of the die roll" from the 3 fails rule.  An aside on that, it's sometimes overlooked it's not "three failures while down" it's "three failures between rests", go down, fail a save, then make it and get brought up by healing, you're down to 2 failures left this round.  So it adds some tension on the die roll.<br/><br/>To be simpler (in spirit of not adding on too many different bells and whistles, working within existing mechanics), you could have a "near death" experience inflict a mini version of the universal penalty dying inflicts for about half the time.  You can require people to "colour that" with whatever it amounts to - be it limp, ringing in ears, psych. issues.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174774/#Comment_174774" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T12:10:27+00:00" title="October 13, 2008 12:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would just use the condition chart and maybe add one or two injury oriented conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174778/#Comment_174778" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T12:26:39+00:00" title="October 13, 2008 12:26PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2008 8:35PM by Logos7.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ***=Quoted Material<br/><br/>***I think that 4e's goal of making death exciting and tense is only partly realized.

Let the dying character (or for that matter the dead one), continue to have an effect each encounter as their memory, spirit, etc. influences their friends and allies.  Let them transfer action points and healing surges to other players - as long as the other player accepts the narrated reasoning.  With some thought, work out how their at-wills, dailies, encounters can even be used or some similar power effect done.<br/><br/>As Redgar lies dying, Mialee's player is offered a healing surge based on "Recalling that though their romantic lives parted ways since for that brief time when they were lovers how he made her feel so alive".  Tordek does not have that Brute Strike martial power but gets to use it this once  "Remembering how Redgar pulled out all the stops in the fight [never done onscreen] where he saved Tordek's life from those bugbears with his mighty blow."<br/><br/>Indirectly, you bump the now 4 instead of 5 (or whatever/whatever) group back up a bit towards what was expected in terms of facing encounters.  The "inactive player" gains a more GM-like content authority subject to veto if no one wants to accept it.<br/><br/>Narratively, you produce an effect more like fiction/movies - when someone goes down, that's when the rest then shine and win through (rather than a death spiral for whole group start).<br/><br/>Now, if there's 3 dead PC's doing this at once, it gets a bit over the top of course.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174801/#Comment_174801" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T14:35:01+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  2:35PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2008 2:35PM by Esarel.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4E has three different phases, and I think the game suffers badly from trying to map the same death mechanics to all three tiers.  I think it would be very helpful to allow the rules to differ by tier, so that you don't get one size fits all death for plane-traveling hell storming heroes, and the band of kids trying to drive the rat-king out of their town.  For example you could say:  At heroic level the characters take a limitation as Adam suggested.  When you get to Paragon you have to make a bargain with a god for your life.  When you get to Epic you get your three saves and nothing can bring you back.<br/><br/>Those three are not necessarily the best options, but I think a big part of the problem is that different death mechanics are needed at the different tiers.  This is largely due to the attempt by 4E to be three games at once.<br/><br/>Another different idea is that a different character could suffer the penalty for saving you (one of your companions deflected the killing blow).  This could at least help to ward off the death spiral from limitations or bargains.  Thematically it is a bit harder to work and I doubt many of the hardcore 4Eers would like it, but it would drastically change the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174805/#Comment_174805" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T14:46:51+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  2:46PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I think that 4e's goal of making death exciting and tense is only partly realized.</blockquote>\nNo one has mentioned the fun (to me, anyway) in-game crisis that death saves provoke.  We've had characters make exciting all-out dashes across the map, madly dodging opportunity attacks, to get in position to use their crappy Heal skill to stabilize another character.  It really jazzes up the encounter, especially if there are other priorities and choices have to be made.<br/><br/>( At least, at first level, it jazzes up the encounter; I don't know how it goes for the godlings who can sneeze out Raise Deads. )<br/><br/>Death rescues really feel like the ultimate expression of teamwork, especially on the player level.  It's like when I crap out in Rock Band and someone rocks out and gets me back into the game so I can play again.  They've rescued my fun!  Yay!  <br/><br/>The negative hit point autodeath rule I could do away with, though.  I don't see the need or the benefit, and I don't think the death from that rule in our campaign was real fun for anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174808/#Comment_174808" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T14:58:13+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  2:58PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>If the design is doing everything it can to make death a "speed bump" for characters but still provide tension in play, maybe death isn't the answer after all. I'd rather see a system of penalties that provide color and quest opportunities.</blockquote>\nI don't think the game is trying to do that.<br/><br/><br/>Please expand. Saying "I don't think so" doesn't really advance the conversation.<br/><br/>I think the designers have built 4e such that, at high levels, character death is not something to be taken seriously. James Wyatt <i>says</i> in his article:\n<blockquote><cite>James Wyatt</cite>Early on, Rob, Andy, and I sketched out some ideas about how death's impact on the game might vary over the course of the three tiers of play. At the lowest levels of the game, we figured, death could very well mean making a new character. When you've only played a character for a couple of levels, you're not that attached to it yet. Making a new one isn't that terrible a price to pay for an encounter gone terribly wrong. By the high heroic levels, and certainly the paragon tier, death comes with a more significant cost. It means stopping your adventure for the day, paying the price, and possibly story-based implications, up to and including failing a mission. At epic levels, though, death might become a speed bump. The consequences of failure in an encounter or an adventure might be much more significant than the life or death of a single character. When the fate of the world or even multiple planes hangs in the balance, fates far worse than death can await characters who fail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Logos7:</cite>To loosely quote lumpley, mechanical grief to some extent is boring. No one is jowling arround the the table about -1 to speed modifier, send gilbert back in a women's body etc, and it becomes more interesting.<br/><br/>Then the question is does that cleave to the genre closely enough?</blockquote>\nMechanical grief is not that boring in a Gamist design like 4e. Besides, there's color there, too, in my examples. A painful limp is more than mechanics; there's characterization and something to role-play. Also, there's a <i>quest</i> tacked on, so that opens up new possibilities. It turns a boring death save into an exciting adventure.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that by "cleave to the genre closely enough," you're suggesting a test for my rules hack: does it fit the fantasy genre well? Why wouldn't it? You just write limitations that fit the genre and you make them feel like nasty-evil-negative-world versions of powers.\n<blockquote>From KPFS - what you need to do is to get the player to make their own grief, and in order to avoid the lame mechanical (and almost exactly the trivial speedbump that you are compleigning about) you need to hold the big banhammer of greif over their heads.</blockquote>\nUh, why the banhammer of grief? I don't get that.<br/><br/>And if you let the players choose their own limitations from a list, they <i>do</i> choose their own grief. Maybe I am missing your point. Clarify?\n<blockquote>Personally, I'm not sure this kind of story approach really does a standard fantasy that well, sure its okay if once in a while redgar the fighter gets hit on the head and has a vision quest and has to go on a epic journey to discover the mystic elixer of vitality so that he stops bleeding out of his ears when you turn him upside down, but if something like that happened everytime, it would get kind of wierd for me. And your injury bits are just extra inconsequential fiddly bit speed bumps with a nod toward somekind of realism. (if real people got knocked down like adventure's do, they'd all be mohammed ali's in just a few short years not counting those that just die from head trauma, shock, big gapping holes in the head, etc.</blockquote>\nI would argue that D&amp;D 4e isn't at all "standard fantasy," if I was even sure what "standard fantasy" is these days. D&amp;D has, over time, become its own genre, and 4e is even more its own thing. I mean, clerics can hit monsters so hard that their friends heal damage. What's so genre-busting about taking a wound that is so bad that you limp around and move more slowly?  What's so genre-busting about having to level up or find a special plant that cured whatever kind of damage caused the limp?<br/><br/>And what's this "every time" stuff? How often are characters dying?<br/><br/>I don't understand where you get the idea that this is a nod towards realism. If I wanted "realism" (wtf is that in a 4e game anyway?), people would just die. I want getting reduced to 0 hit points to be mechanically interesting. Right now, it's not and the 4e designers have all but eliminated permanent death anyway. Why not just do away with it and replace it with something that furthers play with quests and adds a tactical twist to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174814/#Comment_174814" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T15:42:08+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  3:42PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Mechanical grief is not that boring in a Gamist design like 4e.

It's also worth noting that a -1 in 4E is next to nothing, compared to the number and size of bonuses. It's not going to make you Shooty McMissalot, you'll still be able to get through most encounters, but when it comes to the BBEG you need every bonus you can get.<br/><br/>If I'm playing Bob and I'm given the options of 'make a new character' or 'have an interesting adventure that makes you at least as strong as before' I'll take the latter. From a purely mechanical standpoint, there's not much of a difference, but as a player hopefully the 'interesting adventure' part makes me happy with it. And if the player has no investment in the character at all, then they'll just kill him off as soon as they feel like they need different mechanics anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174826/#Comment_174826" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T16:57:30+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  4:57PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2008 4:59PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Yes, but does it make removing that penalty an exciting prospect?</blockquote>\nNot really. It makes it a<i> necessary </i>prospect so I'm not penalized. But I would hope that whatever quest or story I was pursuing before being killed was already exciting. And its not like a group is going to run out of quests where a death results in finally something cool to do.<br/><br/>It's not as bad as the existing death penalties (-1 to almost everything) but it lasts longer (goes away after three milestones) so I'd call it a wash as far as how bad things are. 5% is 5% (although the speed limit is more severe, and other penalties could be depending).  It's not really going to counter bonuses I get because those bonuses are factored into game balance.<br/><br/>The quest also risks throwing off the story momentum. We interrupt this quest for an important adventure. A good GM could certainly incorporate it into the ongoing story, but I'm not a fan of systems that require a good GM for effective implementation.  I suppose it could be a minor quest, tacked onto the major one, or in between two major quests, but its the fact that I have a penalty at all that's the sticking point more than the method to remove it. <br/><br/>Instead, perhaps something that made you more interesting without turning it into a bonus. Perhaps instead of penalties to injuries, action point expenditure becomes limited in some way (like, you have to detail how your limp gets in the way or made the most recent action go awry) almost like Aspects, except that you aren't getting a bonus.  Another possibility is that it adds Complications, some resource for the DM to send trouble your way (or the party's way).  This can allow things like in Epic campaigns were death isn't a problem for PCs but results in some catastrophe or death that they were hoping to prevent.<br/><br/>It could even be a minor quest that the player decides how it resolves - they decide how this injury changes their life in some way. They could do it immediately if something comes to mind. A bit like the Complication, except the player gets to propose something.  So maybe the penalty lasts for a very short time, or until I think of something. That's cool because the duration is largely up to me and if I'm in the mood for a lasting penalty because it fits with what's going on, I can do that. If I really want the penalty gone because there's a big fight we're building towards, then I better think of something quick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174847/#Comment_174847" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T20:57:49+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  8:57PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            just to answer the questions asked, <br/><br/>mostly im agreeing with alvin<br/><br/>As for why death in dnd isn't a speedbump? because people die, even with epic once a day negative to full hp powers death is something that must be overcome. Speedbumps don't get extra rule space they get ignored. Epic, Paragon, and Heroic characters will all die, and won't alway be able to be brought back. I don't know what else to say. <br/><br/>I would argue that D&amp;D 4e isn't at all "standard fantasy," if I was even sure what "standard fantasy" is these days. D&amp;D has, over time, become its own genre, and 4e is even more its own thing. I mean, clerics can hit monsters so hard that their friends heal damage. What's so genre-busting about taking a wound that is so bad that you limp around and move more slowly? What's so genre-busting about having to level up or find a special plant that cured whatever kind of damage caused the limp?<br/><br/>I always rather thought Dnd was a pretty staid kitsch genre taken in large parts from tolkien and vance. While it certainly has some mishmashed appeal of its own, I wouldn't call it its own genre by any stretch of the imagination. The genre busting part is your bit, so my dude is so awesome he can't even die but I get lame for a while? Apparently not that awesome, it seems like your trying to chase two horses. <br/><br/>And what's this "every time" stuff? How often are characters dying?<br/><br/>If its a dnd game otherwise by the book this can vary, sometimes not very often and sometimes weekly. Are you prepared for your party to get on a tpk and give them a bunch of lameness and quests, what if someone dies in the middle of their very important quest to prevent death, do they get 2 quests or do they just have to continue this quest, it seems like your mechanic would drag the story kicking  and screaming into this area because if you play dnd anything like i do theirs gonna be a lot of lame/blind/questing pc's regardless of what the players or you originally wanted.<br/><br/>I don't understand where you get the idea that this is a nod towards realism.<br/><br/>All those negative ones and lame legs, them are realism<br/><br/> If I wanted "realism" ..., people would just die.<br/><br/>Exactly, you don't want realism so why are you handing out a bunch of 'realistic' injuries such as foggy vision and scar tissue<br/><br/>(wtf is that in a 4e game anyway?)<br/><br/>realism is the application of real world knowledge or expectations to the game, I mean its not like the manual tells you stuff falls down and because it doesn't say it it doesn't happen. All kinds of realism and versimlitude happen in game regardless if this is a simmy or gammy or whatever you want to call it game (Logos's rule of realism, check how many of those damn manuals have rules for gravity and just think of the possibilities)<br/><br/> I want getting reduced to 0 hit points to be mechanically interesting. Right now, it's not and the 4e designers have all but eliminated permanent death anyway. Why not just do away with it and replace it with something that furthers play with quests and adds a tactical twist to play.<br/><br/>Hey your show, you can do whatever you want, althought i would advise settling for death being interesting first of all. Lots and lots of dnd games have death as a more or less one way trip , and were doing just fine with it. I've listed reasons you may not want to do away with the death as is above (summary, genre expectations, realism, and versimlitude). If your looking for a mechanic to give quests you already have one, if your looking for a mechanic to make players have some power, there are better ones out there. If you want tactical twist pay attention to the context, not -1's  (If you want to indepth critique of the problem with negative one's I just thought of it, the tactical dicision is not in play, its out of it. When the dude is choosing what penalty to take that's tactics and its a completely meta dicession, ) <br/><br/>As for the banhammer of grief, well if you cannot comprehend such a majestic instrument, I suggest you play some kills puppies and focus on giving grief. <br/><br/>(haha, I have references obscure text now I can rest)<br/><br/>Logos<br/><br/>ps. Dude I'm not trying to harsh your mellow here, I just think you want A and are firmly down the path of B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174891/#Comment_174891" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T07:37:15+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  7:37AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're mistaking color for realism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174907/#Comment_174907" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T10:06:25+00:00" title="October 14, 2008 10:06AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2008 10:06AM by Brendan.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><blockquote>No one has mentioned the fun (to me, anyway) in-game crisis that death saves provoke.

It really jazzes up the encounter, especially if there are other priorities and choices have to be made.</blockquote>\nTotally seconded.  Twice in our low-level game, my wheezing, clanging, 5-speed warforged paladin has had to do triple runs (double move + action point) to pick up the downed warlock and carry her to safety (once out of a burning building, once away from a zombie horde and <i>into</i> a burning building).  When I used Lay on Hands after that it was like slapping down the paddles and shouting "clear!"<br/><br/>On my turns in the GM rotation since then, I've been deliberately trying to use dynamic and hazardous terrain to separate the players, just to see if it provokes the same kind of derring-do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174951/#Comment_174951" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T13:27:10+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  1:27PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as a quest to remove an injury being a sidetrack, I'd like to think of it more as a second story thread. I recently talked to some friends about this type of gaming, how a really good game means that there's more then one thread of the story to resolve. Mount Interestingadventure may be close to somewhere they need to go anyway, but it's not too good of an example. A better one might be the bitter old healer Plotpoint who can restore vision, but only if the character can prove he deserves it. Or the drug dealer who can fix your vision, but at the cost of a favor to be named later. Or the herb that will remove the blurry vision if taken regularly, but is also illegal within the empire. Now you've got an interesting plot that takes place in the midst of everything else.<br/><br/>You could also structure it kind of like Achievements in Xbox games: they make you play a little differently. So blurry vision is a problem until you learn to deal with it, which is represented in game as making x successful Perception checks, or hitting a target at least y range, or whatever. Now the player is going out of their way to do something that still fits within the adventure. The adventure continues, but now the player is trying to use their vision more, or attack targets at the edge of their range, to remove the penalty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174987/#Comment_174987" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T16:58:24+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  4:58PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>You could also structure it kind of like Achievements in Xbox games: they make you play a little differently.</blockquote>\nWow.
