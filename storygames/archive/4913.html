I always bought it without questioning. Shame on me, I should know better than that by now\u2026<br/><br/>In a forum thread about the question of valuing game experiences that aren\u2019t fun, I finally realized that the question originated in the opposition between \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cpainful.\u201d As long as fun is my goal, I can\u2019t find value in games that are painful, because these things are opposites. Fun is not pain, and vice versa. But I found myself conflicted, because I think there is value in those sorts of experiences. There is simply no other way to explore that ground without screwing up my real life badly. So\u2026fun can\u2019t be where the value comes from. And if that\u2019s the case, then fun isn\u2019t really my goal, despite what others may tell me. So what is it, at the deepest level, that unites experiences with personal, subjective value?<br/><br/>Answering that question led directly to my new philosophy of roleplaying:<br/><br/>\u201cRoleplaying should be fulfilling.\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nThat is, of course, it's own sacred cow, created to kill the old one.

There's a possibly anti-intellectual assumption in the latter that if we bother to try to understand something that is fun, it will somehow become un-fun.<br/><br/>So regardless of the theoretical issue of whether or not roleplaying should be fun, we have to look at the social context in which such statements are made, because usually there's a deeper implied statement.<br/><br/>I think "fun" is a little too abstract to make useful generalizations about, but it's certainly possible that the implied statement here is a signalling of consent. As in, "You may think such a thing would be rewarding, but I am not interested in participating in any such thing."<br/><br/><br/><br/>You may now accuse me of being No Fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110155/#Comment_110155" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T16:04:32+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  4:04PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take an order of "roleplaying should not be a chore" with a family-sized side dish of "what is 'fun' for me depends on context, so even if I pass on a game about angsty personal psychodrama right now, I might be in the mood to try it some other time."<br/><br/>All my bad, "no fun" gaming experiences were either tedious chores (having to do lots of boring, uninteresting, or laborious tasks with little or no payoff in return) or came from a place that was wildly mismatched to my real-life mood (comedy when I felt like doing tragedy, or vice versa).

I must admit I avoid anything relentlessly depressing as a matter of policy, because they leave <strong>me</strong> depressed.  I know many people find such stories entertaining or even uplifting (like my brother-in-law), but they always seemed like such an alien thing to do with your time.  This does not mean that I avoid all forms of entertainment that contain depressing <em>elements</em>, but rather just those that focus on them to (what seems to me to be) an excessive extent.  I am reminded of novelist Robertson Davies' comment to the effect that many authors confuse solemn with serious.  Real life usually has its ups and downs, its moments of humor to balance its moments of tragedy, and art that focuses on one to the exclusion of the other is equally unbalanced; except of course, focusing on the humor can be enjoyable for me, whereas focusing on the tragedy only leaves me depressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110278/#Comment_110278" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T08:32:43+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  8:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope I'm not soapboxing here, but this is a thought I had about the first post.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be fun, we're not supposed to think too much deeper about the experience than that. Make it fun, play and shut up.<br/><br/>Thing is, Ron E really clarified something for me, when he said "Whatever. The thing is, you can, in fact, find certain techniques, tricks, elements that successfully (maybe not a guarantee, but still) reproduce that fun almost every time they are used."  <br/><br/>I totally agree with that. It's the reason that some GMs are just fucking awesome: They've done things they found were successful, subconsciously put those tools in the mental toolbox to bring out later, and so on.<br/><br/>The ooooooooonnnnly thing that is problematic from there is, "Fun is reproducible". Agree? Agree. Cool. We're all agreed.<br/><br/>..."Fun for <i>whom</i>?"<br/><br/>That's a problem.<br/><br/>Now, there are sorts of universal techniques a GM can use that can pretty much go across almost every game they play. Stuff like:<br/><br/>* Give the players positive feedback ("That was awesome!")<br/>* Only make them roll dice for important things.<br/>* Don't overshadow them with NPCs or GM-NPCs.<br/>etc<br/><br/>But then if you start going deeper, like "Have the players set their own adversity. Have the players define the world in which they play"... that becomes a question of "These are techniques to make fun reproducible... for some people".  Others, like "Always hide your dice behind the screen. Turn up the heat if a player leaves the party or tries to buck the adventure"... those techniques reproduce fun for some people and not others.<br/><br/>It's not so bad that it's worth ditching the idea of "finding and reproducing techniques to 'enhance fun' ", but it's worth being aware that at the ends of the scale, your fun and my fun may be different.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was kind of lateral to the discussion above, but I think sort of meshes with the ideas of the first post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110279/#Comment_110279" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T08:36:59+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  8:36AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I certainly dont think watching Schindlers List or Grave of the Fireflies was fun.

Maybe that's more specific or just a different emphasis, but I think it describes <em>my</em> approach pretty well.  Yours may differ, and that's totally cool!

Do you watch<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>?

I'm not going to sit down to watch Schindler's List; I'm familiar with the subject matter, I've heard it's well done, but that's not where I want to spend my free time.  When I was younger I saw some gory stuff like Se7en and while I was into it at the time now it just makes me sick.  That said, it's not the end-all be-all of my criteria.  I enjoy some episodes of Deadwood, I just wish I could watch them, go back in time, fill myself in on a few episodes, and then skip those.<br/><br/>Roleplaying amps up the emotional stakes - this is one of the reasons I enjoy them so much.  I could probably play in a game based on Deadwood, but it'd be more like the Good the Bad and the Ugly.  I'm not going to play a game about being a sexually abused prostitute, or where the sexual abuse of a prostitute was the main subject matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110410/#Comment_110410" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:50:20+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:50PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to agree with Ryan on this. I play to create fun stories, to escape and to have a good time. I have used emotional and moral themes in games, but they were always part of the story, not THE story. While I can appreciate games that are all about pushing players and dealing with rough emotional issues, I don't really want to play them. If my best scenario with a game is feeling bad, then I'm not going to do that game. I have two little boys, and I can tell you right now if a game has children in danger or being abused, I am gone. That's probably why I will never play a game like LIttle Fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this sacred cow of feeling RPGs have to be fun is countered by another sacred cow I've seen: If you aren't dealing with serious, gut-wrenching issues, then you really aren't a roleplayer.

Right?<br/><br/>If so, then I can see how this particular thread is getting derailed.  I said "Hey, I don't like this thing, but I do like this other thing."  Others have sided with both of those views.  Then I said "Hey, there's this game (Carry), and maybe a whole class of games, that deal with some pretty hardcore stuff that really doesn't sound fun to me, but that I would play anyway, because I find value in experiences other than fun."  And since the example came way later, maybe that's where we got off track.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, there are games out there which are very serious, which some people enjoy.  I would go so far as to say that there are games that prioritize serious issues above pure fun -- and the posts in this thread bear out that theory, insofar as people feel compelled to defend one or the other.  So long as we can point to a game that works for some group that does not hold the assumption that roleplaying must be fun above all else, I think we can say we've killed that cow.  Whether you personally would find that game enjoyable or not, it is a counter-example.  <br/><br/>And it's OK to not want to play games without certain assumptions in place - you can hold whichever ones you want, and I won't call them badwrongfun.  But the point of these threads isn't to say (despite my pronouncement above) how roleplaying ought to be, but how it <em>can</em> be.  If the way I've made the point has conflated those two issues, that's my bad.  Bottom line: roleplaying doesn't have to be fun.  It doesn't have to be fulfilling either.  Your pick, between those and any other kinds of value you find in roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110496/#Comment_110496" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T19:17:01+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  7:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2007 5:27AM by merb101.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I think this sacred cow of feeling RPGs have to be fun is countered by another sacred cow I've seen: If you aren't dealing with serious, gut-wrenching issues, then you really aren't a roleplayer.</blockquote>\nI think the word "sacred cow" is starting to be abused here.

I was reading the term "sacred cow" as meaning a belief that is difficult, if not impossible, to convince someone to abandon. I wasn't intending it as an insult, simply I have met people who strongly believe that all roleplaying should be killing things and taking their stuff, and others who completely feel you should be using RPing as a form of social commentary or therapy. Wasn't trying to slam either group, just saying I have a more middle of the road view.<br/><br/>I've noticed a lot of discussions here come down to the meaning of a word or two, and sometimes it is difficult to agree on a common meaning.<br/><br/>And my term "counter culture" was probably poorly worded and carried a context that wasn't intended.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110546/#Comment_110546" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T02:46:09+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  2:46AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I've noticed a lot of discussions here come down to the meaning of a word or two, and sometimes it is difficult to agree on a common meaning.</blockquote>\nAgreed.

If I just approach it as a game, with the right people, I think it'll be fun. Our game-cum-therapy group is taking december off, and playing some 3.5 D&amp;D just for fun. We're still being big story goons, but now it's about dungeon crawls and telling the story of gallant adventures, ale and whores, etc. So there's definitely middle ground to be had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110665/#Comment_110665" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T10:09:31+00:00" title="November 30, 2007 10:09AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>Assumption:  All people value fun over all else in roleplaying.<br/><br/>Counter-example:  Me.</blockquote>\nThis is where my beef comes from about all these opinions being stated as "sacred cows": what you just said won't slaughter anything for me.
