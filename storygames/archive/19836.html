That's okay if you don't, or if you did happen to think it was pretty bad.<br/><br/>Well now we're a year on and I wanted to present something new and slightly shiny for my blog and so I made Version 2 of the game! It's a much better representation of what I wanted to do with the original; specifically, it fits on the front of a single page. It was inspired by Lasers &amp; Feelings' style, though not mechanics. So this version looks significantly better than the original - I've learned at least a little about graphic design since then, though I'm no pro. And it's still a little cramped I guess.<br/>I also upgraded the mechanics, based on a combination of some suggestions from last year, some need to condense large rule sections, and just getting better at game design.<br/>Lastly, I greatly improved the GM section. It should be much easier to understand how to play, and how to run the game. Not perfect, but alright for a one-pager.<br/><br/>So what do you think?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.logbook-project.com/2014/10/superlite-heroes-version-2.html" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE FOR A LINK TO MY BLOG POST RELEASING THE GAME AND DESCRIBING IT BETTER</a><br/><br/><a href="http://bit.ly/SuperliteV2" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME DIRECTLY</a><br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/439793/#Comment_439793" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE TO READ AN ONLINE TRANSCRIPT OF THE GAME</a><br/><br/>- Max "Ego" Hervieux                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439792/#Comment_439792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-29T22:02:20+00:00" title="October 29, 2014 10:02PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2014 10:06PM by Nathan_H.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will check this out.

It loses out on the formatting stuff, but all the rules stay intact.<br/><br/><b>SUPERLITE HEROES! Transcript</b><br/>ite Heroes! is a game of heroes and villains, crime and justice, adventure and disaster.<br/>A group of 3-4 players take on the role of a handful of heroes while a single Game Master (the GM) provides opposition in the form of villains, henchmen, hazards, and schemes.<br/>A single session of Superlite Heroes! should take about 2-3 hours. To play, you will need a handful of index cards, some pencils, and a six-sided die.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/>Playing the game is simple, a conversation between players and the GM. The players say what they do, and the GM responds. Sometimes the GM will intrude with opposition and villainy, but for the most part the players are in control. That is, until the triggers for the mechanics occur, at which point the rules take over. Players narrate successes, while the GM narrates failures, then the conversation is resumed.<br/><br/>THE MECHANICS<br/>Every character has three stats, each valued from 0 to 3.<br/>   ~ Code, your commitment to your beliefs.<br/>   ~ Image, your ability to influence the public.<br/>   ~ Power, a descriptor of your capabilities.<br/><br/>Actions are taken when you do something where the outcome is uncertain. Specifically, roll a six-sided die when any of these occur:<br/>   ~ When you espouse your beliefs, roll against Code.<br/>   ~ When you manipulate public perception, roll against Image.<br/>   ~ When you use your powers, roll against Power.<br/>If the number you rolled is less than or equal to the stat you rolled against plus two, you succeed at what you were trying to do. If the number is more than the stat plus two, you fail at the action.<br/><br/>Each stat also has a number of \u201chealth\u201d associated it; moral (Code), social (Image), and physical (Power). When one of those suffers, roll a six-sided die. If it is less than that health\u2019s current value, reduce the value by one. If a villain is the reason you suffer, subtract one from your roll.<br/><br/>When any of your healths are reduced to zero, choose: abandon your code, fade into obscurity, or retire. If this is your second time at zero health, become a villain or die (not necessarily in that scene, but soon).<br/><br/>CREATING HEROES<br/>If you are a player, you must create your hero!<br/>First you must divide your stats. Divide 4 points between your 3 stats, with a maximum of 3 in any single stat.<br/>For each point in a stat, you get a Strength in that stat.<br/>Code Strengths:<br/>   ~ Admirable: Others support your code, and are willing to help you uphold it.<br/>   ~ Disciplined: You never flinch or hesitate under stress.<br/>   ~ Driven: When a stat drops to 0, you do not have to choose your fate until the end of the scene.<br/>Image Strengths:<br/>   ~ Allies: You\u2019ve always got friends you can call on.<br/>   ~ Beloved: The public loves you, and you can rely on their support.<br/>   ~ Resources: Money and stuff is at your fingertips.<br/>Power Strengths:<br/>   ~ Kick-Ass: Subtract 1 from Power rolls against mooks.<br/>   ~ Unkillable: Mooks cannot hurt you.<br/>   ~ Versatile: Your power is usable in many situations.<br/><br/>You also get a Drawback in either your highest or lowest stat, your choice.<br/>Code Drawbacks:<br/>   ~ Restrictive: Your code is limiting, and uncompromising.<br/>   ~ Unconventional: Your code is unappealing to the public.<br/>Image Drawbacks:<br/>   ~ Paparazzi: The media is always after you, either angry or simply annoying.<br/>   ~ Part of a Whole: You don\u2019t perform well when alone.<br/>Power Drawbacks:<br/>   ~ Berserker: You lose control as you suffer.<br/>   ~ Unreliable: Sometimes your power cuts out on you.<br/><br/>Your healths start at the value of the associated stat plus one, for a total of seven health.<br/>Other than your stats and health, you should decide on a name for your hero, whether your identity is public, what your costume is like, what your code entails, and, of course, what your powers are.<br/><br/>GAME MASTERING<br/>If you are the Game Master, follow these simple rules:<br/>   ~ Good villains are for making great heroes. Obstruct the characters to highlight and feature them, not to defeat or limit them.<br/>   ~ The spotlight belongs to you. Choose who gets to be in-panel at the moment to give everyone time to shine.<br/>   ~ Ask provocative questions and incorporate the answers. Help flesh out their heroes, and use it to make the story personal.<br/>   ~ Do not pre-play or write plots. Play to find out what happens. Let the players drive their own actions.<br/><br/>Before starting, create a Villain for the game. Roll a six-sided die on each table, choose options, or write your own for each of the following categories.<br/>[Result]\t  [Name]\t\t[Power]\t        \t[Desire]<br/>1\t          Angel\t\tAnimal Abilities\tDestruction<br/>2\t          Dr. Chaos\tElement Control\tInfluence<br/>3\t          Mogul\t\tPowerless\t                Justice<br/>4\t          Red Night\tPsychic\t\t        Recognition<br/>5\t          The Colonel\tSuper Strength\t        Revenge<br/>6\t          The End\t\tTransformation  \tWealth<br/><br/>Here are a few pacing tricks.<br/>   ~ Do time skips to give a grander feel. Ask what characters have been doing in the interim.<br/>   ~ Expose the Villain early, but make them unattainable. Secret weaknesses, waves of mooks, physical isolation, and public consequences to their defeat are all good for keeping a game from reaching an immediate climax.<br/>   ~ Use supporting characters to put barriers between heroes cooperating; no heroic team is drama-free.<br/><br/>And then the legal blurb about fonts and copyright and how to send me feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
