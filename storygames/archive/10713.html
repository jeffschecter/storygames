Then two more players showed up, and so we split into two groups of four, which was much more manageable.  There were three characters, all women - a nurse, a housewife, and a lonely spinster with a graduate degree.  3x4 = 12 scenes, perfect for an evening. <br/><br/>This game has obviously had the hell playtested out of it.  The mechanics felt balanced on a knife's edge the whole time.  Moreover, everything just *felt* right - e.g. the Director and the players are almost symmetrical in their abilities, except the Director wins on ties.  So evil.  The mechanics do a great job of tying into the fiction and giving strong incentives draw scenes out a bit rather than rush headlong into conflict, while the hard limits on the dice you can add to your pool prevent players from reaching too much and trying to activate every one of their abilities every turn. <br/><br/>Each character has a "ticker" - someone close to them was replaced by the conspiracy, becoming one of the Director's agents.  The first scene we played, involving a housewife whose children had been replaced, consisted of her confronting the principal of their school about the mysterious medical procedure they had been subjected to.  This scene was pretty lame, and bad for me as the director mechanically.  Lesson learned: Love the ticker, don't fight it.  For the first scene, at least, insist on having the Replaced loved ones in it!  That made the rest of the first round much more exciting.   The mechanics create a  bizarre but entertaining dynamic here.  The first agent a character confronts is almost always going to be the one from her ticker.  But if the character wins the scene's conflict, the stress they cause is almost certainly going to deactivate that agent!  It seemed out-of-genre for the agents to be "returned to normal" so we had a lot of pyrrhic victories.  In one creepy scene, the nurse was searching for her (agent) mother in a hospital at night during brown-outs.  She won, but the stress reduced the mother's rating to zero.  She found her mother in a partially-completed wing of the hospital, waltzing in the dark with an invisible partner to music only she could hear (the music was one of my secrets).  The mother waltzed out the glassless window frame, and fell three stories.<br/><br/>The most successful storyline was the Mildred the spinster's.  Her ticker was that her fiance, who left her at the altar 10 years earlier, had returned (as an agent).  In the first scene, he convinced her to marry him and return with him to the top secret facility where he had been working (this turned out to be a faux suburb built in the Nevada desert... one of the bride's anxieties was agoraphobia).  It turned out that the fiance was the original test subject for Section 44, and retained some human emotions, like his love for Mildred.  In the second scene, she broke into the forbidden Building 44, and learned some of the Conspiracy's secrets, but the scientists began to suspect her and planned her replacement.  In the third scene, she decided to confront the Section 44 scientists and offer to join them.  She won the conflict, and became part of the conspiracy, but the stress to the director dropped her fiance's rating to zero.  Her first assignment was to assist in opening him up to see what made him different, and turning him into just another drone.  The final scene was a dispute between the scientists over whether or not they were morally obligated to become replacements themselves.  Mildred let the other scientists turn her aunt into a replacement to forestall the decision, but in the end they all agreed to be bound by majority vote and chose to convert themselves.  The epilogue showed the Mildred and her fiance (now husband) dancing together mechanically to the replacements' waltz. <br/><br/>44 is a great game that does a lot of things I really like: it plays in an evening, has a strong structure, and tells a particular kind of story really well.  Like the Mountain Witch or My Life With Master, it's not a game that I would play every week for six months, but it's definitely one that I'm happy to have on hand for when the mood strikes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238036/#Comment_238036" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T03:25:11+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  3:25AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            creeeeeepy.<br/><br/>Thanks for that report!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
