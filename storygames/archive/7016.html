I've cleaned it up a bit, tweaked a few of the rules, and gave it an artistic layout. Now, it's available to the world, for free!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be greatly interested in what you guys think about the game. If anyone wants to playtest it, please post that, too! It's certainly a work in progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the blurb and the link:<br/>\n<br/>\nGET OUT OF INFERNOPOLIS: A Storytelling Game of Improv &amp; Absurdity<br/>\n<br/>\nINFERNOPOLIS is a pretty hellish place, but the stories that go on down there are pretty hilarious!<br/>\n<br/>\none player tells the stories of a poor soul who\u2019s trying to find his way out! The other players are the petty demons who complicate his stories with interruptions and embellishments!<br/>\n<br/>\nsurreal, often random, and invariably absurd, GET OUT OF INFERNOPOLIS uses the UNO\xae card game to help prompt you. You\u2019ll be creating unique, hysterical improv stories every time!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ozbot.typepad.com/Get_Out_of_Infernopolis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ozbot.typepad.com/Get_Out_of_Infernopolis.pdf</a>24 pages, file size: 1.7 MB                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
