For example, take nationalism. Both "ethnic pride" nationalism and "nation-state" nationalism are very much tied up in everyday activities. For example, watching the news in America and watching the news in China are both important social rituals, but they have differences and connotations that are important, which ultimately express something about philosophical differences (whether between cultures or between styles of governance or between different ideas about what the media should do). Watching the news in America, you expect a fair bit of yellow journalism, some local horror stories of crime and injury, the corny feel-good stuff about schools or families or local do-gooders.  Watching the news in China, you expect that the first two stories are about what Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao did today, even if they conducted completely banal negotiations with the President of Nauru. You also expect very few stories (often none at all) about anything bad happening to anyone, unless corrupt local officials are being punished (in which case it shows that the state is doing its job).<br/><br/>So I guess, if how people watch the news can demonstrate philosophical differences... then I'm not sure what else you need besides some solid cultural stuff like what Simon C suggested. Cultures will exhibit philosophical differences without you having to prime the pump at all, I suspect.  Also, I worry that if you try to force "philosophy" to be really important, you're going to get a superficial stereotype of cultural interaction, instead of something deeper or more realistic.<br/><br/>Also, yeah, like Joshua says, there's that historical fiction game about social change called <i>Shock:</i> (which everyone wrongly believes is a science fiction game, which probably helps it sell more copies or something).

Some are voluntary explorers/adventurers, some are looking to settle, some are undesirables being shipped out.  In the Wild Plane, the human govt there is split between loyalists to the Home Plane govt and separatists who think the old govt is corrupt and evil, and want to break with it and establish a Wild Plane govt as something new.  This basic setup supports all sorts of familiar dynamics from world history regarding colonization, exploitation, loyalism, rebellion, etc.  <br/><br/>For every adventure that further develops the Wild Plane (which is still being explored, beaten into submission, etc.), it's rather easy to see how the new material (mostly resources, but some threats too) might play into the arguments, and how each side might try to use any new find to justify their own positions.<br/><br/>So, with that framework, Al assigns politics to his NPCs.  I don't have his list in front of me, but it includes stuff like:<br/>natural-rights-based<br/>libertarian<br/>authoritarian<br/>anarchist<br/>socialist<br/>These aren't groups or clans or anything.  These are perspectives to be applied to the ongoing conflict as played out and developed in the adventures of play.<br/><br/>So, I've completely ignored Part 1 of your question, but if you can cover that, I think this kind of dynamic would do a nice job of Part 2 and Part 3.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198826/#Comment_198826" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T23:32:29+00:00" title="March 25, 2009 11:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of games treat philosophy as a bare adjunct grafted onto setting in a way that's very static and boring. For example, "the people of this race or anarchistic" or "this religion is altruistic." This gets pretty boring and is a source of frustration to me personally (it's why I wrote Principia).<br/><br/>Instead, try working from philosophical statements. These are sentences that you can easily brainstorm at the table and pick out the good ones. For example, in practically any setting there are rich and poor people. You might brainstorm a statement like 'to each according to their need'.  Belief in the statement should have consequences in your world, one way or the other.<br/><br/>Then look for ways to actively engage setting and situation using that statement. For example, in SotC, that might make a good aspect for someone. It could be a Dogs trait, or tied into a TSOY key. I can look at it and use it to generate ideas about how a character might act in a given situation. It can be a source of conflict. You can also do the same for institutions. What does a kingdom look like when it embodies the statement "honor above all" as opposed to "victory at any cost?"<br/><br/>One technique is to give an institution a philosophical basis in the form of a belief or mission. Then give people associated with that institution their own goals and beliefs that are sometimes in conflict and sometimes not. The mission of the Church might be to serve the downtrodden, but the mission of the Bishop might be entirely different.<br/><br/>Use philosophical statements in such a way that the choice to act in accord with it or not is an interesting and dynamic choice. Sometimes I see philosophy used as an excuse for a player or the GM to renege on their responsibility to play characters as dynamic interesting entities. If being a lawful good paladin in my world means I have a nebulous allegiance to "goodness", and never make an interesting choice, then being a paladin isn't philosophically interesting. If it means being forced to choose between two values (e.g. "protect the innocent" and "serve the King"), suddenly it's interesting choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198849/#Comment_198849" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T06:37:03+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  6:37AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I'm talking about question 3, I'm not really talking about ideological conflicts between cultures or between people within a culture.  For those you can just make characters with variations on those leanings and stick a sword in their hands (or point best interests at each other).  <br/><br/>That lets you make conflict over ideologies without really making the examination of those philosophical central to play.  Saying there's overarching ideological warfare, for example, is ham-handed and smacks of the Crusades.  To Tony and Jonathan's points, ideological conflict divorced from material conflict doesn't hold water interpersonally - greed, envy, and so on have to drive conflict, not ideological concerns divorced from everything else.<br/><br/>What I'm talking about is, <i>in addition</i> to making philosophically rich factions / cultures, transforming their central tenets ideas into the <b>means by which conflict occurs</b>.<br/><br/>Now, yeah, I don't have Shock yet, and I know I really, really should, but I can't afford an IPR order (I get gouged on shipping to Canada) for the next couple of months.

They see human experience being caught between two concepts: The Darkness that Comes Before (all the emotional, material, and passionate things that drive us to action) and the Logos (our ability to understand ourselves and thereby transcend the animal-like drives of our material, meat bodies).  <br/><br/>But these guys don't just beat a drum and yell at the other guys who have a different ideology.  That would be the real-world way of doing it.  The Dunyain understand facial musculature, deeply examine their own metabolism, and eliminate their emotions (but take them on when it's instructive).  This lets them perceive and push other people, seeing what the religous characters call the "movement of their souls", and take prophet-like roles among the people around them.  <br/><br/>One of the characters that emerges from this takes deliberately insane actions, and behaves intensely erratically - this madness gives him the ability to stay out from under the sway of the Dunyain. <br/><br/>That's just one example, but you can see that it's like those characters are playing a different game.  So what I'm getting at is every time we come up with one of these, it's like we have to design a whole Dogs in the Vineyard again.  I'm wondering if there's a machine we could make that would pump out mechanics for other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198867/#Comment_198867" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T08:13:24+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  8:13AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I think I understand what you're after here. You want mechanics that take what a character believes and turn it into what the character does (and maybe, by extension what the player does?) And this is different from just giving characters beliefs and pointing them at each other, because in that case, even though the characters have different beliefs, their mode of conflict doesn't reflect their beliefs. They're having a swordfight over Aristotle, but it's still just a sword fight. Am I getting your question right?<br/><br/>So if we load two characters up with contrary philosophical beliefs, then point them at each other, sometimes they swordfight, and sometimes we get them trying to act out their philosophies. For example, sometimes the anarchist throws bombs, and the socialist tries to organize the oppressed Lizardman workers or something. Sometimes they just fight or have an argument. In your example, the Dunyain try to get some guy to follow his "inner Logos", and the guy acts insane to escape their grip. We want to encourage this and give it teeth.<br/><br/>So you might give characters mechanical specialty bits tied to their philosophies, something like TSOY Secrets maybe. Simple secrets that affect the dice can be generated pretty quickly, or more intricate secrets tailored to a particular philosophy could be made ahead of time. The goal is to have characters who have a philosophical belief and a way to act on it that actualizes it in the game world.<br/><br/>Finally, you might try to have a way for characters to fight *over* a philosophical belief. Any mechanic that gives players control over campaign outcomes can be adapted for this: Say yes or face the dungeon (say yes or face the Logos), or something like the Burning Empires infection mechanic. Maybe you can give a philosophical belief a harm track and let characters try to bring it down through play!<br/><br/>These are some specific ingredients for philosophical drama. I use them all in Principia, but there are a million ways to combine them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198878/#Comment_198878" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T09:17:43+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  9:17AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>They're having a swordfight over Aristotle, but it's still just a sword fight.

That's my point exactly, as is this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>The goal is to have characters who have a philosophical belief and a way to act on it that actualizes it in the game world.</blockquote>Exactly.  That's why I've been grappling with it rather than just sitting down with my group, making Simoncian cultures, and playing In A Wicked Age - because in that case the philosophies would all affect the world in the same way (as particular strengths do, through conflict, or as nonconflict stuff does, through talking).  <br/><br/>So I think what I'm looking for is a baseline game, with clear guidelines for how to add to it.

I'll look at Principia around when I grab Shock (and HtHaD).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198881/#Comment_198881" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T09:21:35+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  9:21AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also you may be doing a discredit to good old fashion anthropology and sociology here. <br/><br/>Take your crusades example, was it ever really about conflicting ideologies or that the catholic church needed mad money and wanted to take out a competitor at the same time.

What the fuck is up with this place? - This is the Base Question of philosophy. It's the starting point for any system. (It can be the end point; see II.)<br/><br/>I.A. What do I know about it? - This is the Ontology Question. It provides the foundation for what data will be permitted and what won't (or will be suspect).<br/>I.A.i. How do I gauge what I know? - This is where current technology comes in--a philosophy is going to change based on the level of detail its technology can observe or measure. Here's you one main cultural hook.<br/>I.A.ii. What is the relevance of that which I perceive? - This is where suspicion of validity (from I.A.) comes into play. it is also where things like the movement of an ant colony is dismissed, but comets are made into omens. Or vice versa.<br/><br/>I.B. What does it matter that I know that? - This is the Metaethical Question. It provides the foundations or premises for all normative ethical behaviors, mores, and values. Here's the other main cultural hook.<br/>I.B.i. Should I try to "be good?" - This is the Ethical Question. If one does not have to serve the metaethical construct from II.B, then one needn't proceed further with inquiry.<br/>I.B.ii. How do I do that (or not)? - This is practical ethics, the place where laws and traditions take root.<br/><br/>II. Unask the question. - Nihilists and mystics and some existentialists favor this approach to the Base Question. Nothing matters; or if it does matter, it's unknowable OR you're a gnat's fart in the hurricane, so quite your whining and get back to work (or navel gazing or servicing your every appetite).<br/><br/>I think that pretty much gives you the questionnaire to build any sort of practical (and practicable) philosophy. A culture based on a philosophy is merely the way in which the collective enforces (or disregards) the conclusions to the questions. A character in a culture is basically what Simon's Thing generates: go with the flow or not; to what extent; how overtly or covertly; and what will make the character change its tune?<br/><br/>As for mechanics for such stuff? Meh... System Doesn't Matter. Use Hero or Universalis and get on with the story making. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198910/#Comment_198910" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T10:31:13+00:00" title="March 26, 2009 10:31AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Take your crusades example, was it ever really about conflicting ideologies or that the catholic church needed mad money and wanted to take out a competitor at the same time.
