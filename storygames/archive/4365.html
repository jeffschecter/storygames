In such a game, the closest thing to action would be remembrance of action, shown through summary, discussion, or brief flashback. All else would be inaction.<br/><br/>Or if there is already a good game along those lines, I imagine it would be a good source for mining inaction mechanics.</blockquote>\nThis came out of the discussion on Inaction.  For certain genres, I find this powerfully appealling.  For sometime, I've toyed conceptually with just this model for a comic book/supers game.  You know the heroes are going to win in the end.  What's interesting is the life that goes on between the fights.  <br/><br/>Maybe some sort of mod of PTA (Prime Time Adventures).  For the action scenes, you just describe the action and the results, perhaps spending resources earned in the inaction scenes.  Perhaps describing failure to set up more angstful inaction scenes.<br/><br/>It's during the inaction scenes where mechanics kick in.  Dice rolls determine what resources you gather, probably augmented with 'fan mail' from your fellow players who feel your 'inaction' is particularly cool, poignant, whatever.<br/><br/>I almost feel a bit of DRYH (Don't Rest Your Head) in there too:  "That scene description describing your angst over the danger you have put your aunt in by revealing your secret identity was particularly moving.  Here's 4 Angst dice.  But the bit where you considered asking the rich guy who put you in this position to begin with through his political maneuvering didn't fly with me, so here's 1 Silly die.  And don't forget your base 2 dice of Responsibility from your character sheet.  Roll and lets see what pool dominates!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98552/#Comment_98552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T06:59:19+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  6:59AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what would the players be trying to do?<br/><br/>Is their goal to retroactively put the most plausible/entertaining/whatever interpretation possible on the events?

In part, another part is managing your personal relationship map.  Is Superman lessened when he lets his ties to Jimmy Olsen die?  What about Lois Lane?  Is Spiderman less of a hero with out Aunt May or Mary Jane?  I think so.  They may not be any less powerful, but they are certainly less interesting.<br/><br/>In a previous life, I described comic books to my significant other at the time as "my soap opera".  The person in question was hooked on some soap opera or another (the fact that I can't tell you which tells you much about the relationship), but could not understand why I "wasted money" on comics.  And to a certain extent the comparison was valid.  I always figured the good guys would win - it was the character stuff that intrigued me.<br/><br/>To put it another way, people complain that it is tough to write challenges for Superman - he can do anything.  So the challenges become about the rest of his life.  How does he manage his relationships?  In my opinion, you actually provide a great way to do this with Capes, Tony.  "With Great Power" also does a fine job.<br/><br/>To put it all in a little more context, I've had the basic idea for nearly 10 years, since I saw Rent on stage in Pittsburgh (with my current significant other).  It started as a musical about superheroes.  In my mind, the "action scenes" would take place in panels projected on big screens at the back of the stage, while the musical, the personal interactions, etc., took place on stage and were the focus of the show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
