So the Story-Game Ico would have mechanics for the relationship between the Magical Girl character and the Kid With Horns character, but gloss over the platforming.  Making it complementary to the video game, rather than recreating or emulating it.<br/><br/>Or not.  I don't know.

This is kinda like what I was trying to model in <i>Waiting for the Queen / Tea at Midnight</i> or <i>Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</i>.  Perhaps something similar could work here.  Especially if the "puzzles" were abstracted to be mental puzzles instead of mechanical puzzles.<br><br>For example, perhaps the girl's player describes the environment.  Like: "We're standing on a lone tower.  Ahead, a rope bridge leads to the next parapet, but there are several planks missing in the middle and the drop is lethal.  Nearby there is a burning lamp on a stone stand, a stick, and an inscription."<br><br>And then the horned boy's player has different descriptive powers for interacting with the environment.  "I pick up the stick and light one end of it on the lamp."<br><br>And once the boy begins describing things, the girl can describe other kinds of things.  "I move slowly to the edge of the bridge and drop to my knees, gazing down into the chasm below.  There are shadowy things with wings that are approaching from the lower reaches of the fortress."<br><br>And then there are some descriptive powers that can only be triggered by the interaction of the two characters, like making it across boundaries.  "I run onto the rope bridge and call to you."  Girl: "I come forward and reach out my hand."  Boy: "I grab your hand and set fire to the ropes on our side of the bridge, before kneeling and grabbing tight onto one of the planks."  Girl: "The ropes stap and we swing towards the side of the next parapet, with the shadow beings flapping after us..."<br><br>With some more explicit mechanics and descriptive guidelines, I think something like that could work.<br><br>P.S. I think we should be very careful about assuming that certain things can't be modeled as roleplaying games.  It usually just requires approaching roleplaying from a different perspective, which is often a terrific learning opportunity.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112764/#Comment_112764" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T10:46:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 10:46AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2007 10:47AM by Southpaw.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Thing is, ICO is like 98% visual puzzles.

It's all mood and atmosphere and artistry. You run up this huge tower to get to the pale girl, and it's kind of prolonged--in a game focused all on puzzles and keeping the player engaged with them, you'd not include long stretches of running around. That would be boring and offputting. But here, it impacts the mood. You get a sense of the enormity of the place that the boy is in. There's a feeling of loneliness that directly precedes finding someone to drag along with you.<br/><br/>Does that seem right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112984/#Comment_112984" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T11:11:27+00:00" title="December  8, 2007 11:11AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian, I'm more inclined to see the mood and atmosphere as the "Fruitful Void" that makes everything else meaningful, the same as the relationship between the characters.  Gameplay consists entirely of puzzle after puzzle in this moody but basically empty, featureless castle.  And the feelings that are evoked through play have to do with isolation and loneliness, particularly because the game play is so simplistic and there are no characters that you can communicate with.  And, though play, players invent a kind of fictive relationship between the boy and the girl, not so much based on actual interactions between them during the game, but by inventing subtext and emotional desires in their minds / hearts, yeah?  You imagine them is this cute, kinda romantic, but tragic struggle to escape this prison together, despite the fact that they can't really communicate.  I suspect making mechanics about relationships or mood or atmosphere would kill this aspect dead, where in the Fruitful Void it's free to emerge and dominate the experience of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113011/#Comment_113011" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T13:00:12+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  1:00PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really good analysis.

However, these are not real puzzles but just puzzle-like scenes that the players are supposed to work with however they see fit. Then, you have the girl's player and the boy's player and each has different means of communication available. These are set before the game, possibly - both could have a list of things to do listed, each with a different code narration/behaviour/gesture/whatever attached. And the players need to use these codes to come to an agreement on how to interact with the puzzle. The narrator would probably know the codes, and he or she would tie everything together, deciding on the effects of this interaction somehow. Then, things would get worse, or things would get better, depending on the achieved understanding and coordination.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the list of actions and codes could grow during the course of play, just for the sake of keeping things interesting. So you might have codes like "Such and such wave of hand means I'm opening a magic door.", "When I stare into the ceiling and go 'la-la-la' it means I'm following the boy." and so on, but after a couple of puzzles you could add, say, "When I yawn, I'm keeping the shadow things away from the boy." or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there's some economy that affects the number of moves per scene, or a number of possible attempts to communicate and coordinate actions. Maybe there's some scripting involved, and the narrator executes the scripts step by step, and there are some communication attempts allowed before and during the execution, making it possible to coordinate actions and modify the plans. Or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, you move on to another abstract puzzle-situation and repeat the process. The game would probably end once the players get into perfect synch (e.g. the overall situation turns better and better for a number of consecutive puzzles) or break their relationship completely (e.g. the overall situation turns worse and worse for a number of scenes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113046/#Comment_113046" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T16:38:18+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  4:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been seduced into <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2007/12/08/the-snow-queen-or-ico-the-rpg/" rel="nofollow">yet another design project</a>, thanks to this thread: writing an <i>Ico</i> game based on Hans Christian Anderson's "The Snow Queen."<br><br>Sorry, Marcus, if we haven't been much help at helping you pick an existing system to run <i>Ico</i> with.

Its a rather long read, but I think it brings up some important points that shows Ico to be more than a puzzle game. In fact from my own observations of playing the game, the puzzles are not so much about something you have to overcome for yourself, but something that you have to overcome for your companion. The puzzles are much easier to solve when you stop asking "how do I get there" and start asking "how do I help her get there".<br/>\n<br/>\nBringing the puzzles back to Peter Eliots essay and story gaming, I think that the castle needs to be treated as an adversary and the puzzles need to be viewed as conflicts/attacks made by the castle against Ico, but rather than damage him they impede the only person who can help him escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf particular interest to me in the essay is this:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The real enjoyment of the game lies in accompanying the children on their journey and watching them forge a bond which I will not try to describe. And we need not take apart any mystery to find it. We have dug through an awful heap of information, true, but none of this was strictly necessary for us to see what the story is about. In fact I cannot grasp the two heroes through reasoning. I know too little about them. I do not know their histories, their habits and inclinations, their thoughts and reasons. But here is a strange thought: I know practically nothing about these two, yet I feel that at some level I "know" them far more intimately than characters from any other games. And some of those characters have their biographical data contrived down to birth date and favorite food. I wonder why this is?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe apparent contradiction is resolved once we realize that we are talking about two different modes of knowing. Ico and Yorda become known to us not by exposition but by impression. When you learn a thing by impression, the foremost part of your attention is not on factual details--what counts is how vividly the thing becomes engraved in your thoughts and fancies. It is a very simple matter. You see a man dive in front of an oncoming truck to save a child, and you receive an impression that he is brave and selfless. You watch a couple seated on a bench holding hands, and you receive an impression that they are fond of each other. You may not hear a word of their conversation, but your impression leads you to conclude the talk must be genial. In the same manner, you watch two children fight the rest of the world to escape a fate they have not deserved, struggling together to make the next hundred steps on their thorny path, and you receive an impression that--well, you fill in the blank. But that is how these characters, though largely strangers to us, become alive in our minds and we grow attached to them. And we need no analysis for that.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113067/#Comment_113067" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T19:40:53+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  7:40PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the link, Marcus, that's a fantastic essay.
