<p>Joshua BishopRoby asked me in another thread to explain why Blue Rose is great, so I'll give my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with this game is organization. The really good reward system is hidden in the page before the skill lists. This is just plain dumb. Here's how it goes:</p>
<p>When you make a character, you choose a destiny and a "light nature" and "twilight nature", which are really "how does my character act as his or her best?" and "how does my character act at his or her worst?" When you use either nature to pursue your destiny, you get "Conviction." Conviction is like d20 PCP - for a moment, you can lift cars. You get use any feat for one round, or not die when you should, or bring down righteous skill rolls when you need to. It's good stuff.</p>
<p>This is not complex, but it's the core of narrativist roleplaying reward systems: tempt and reward. The GM's job with this system is to present two options whenever possible: (1) the really hard path to go forth morally on and be good and achieve your destiny, the path that will break you, probably and (2) the pretty easy path to go forth on, do some questionable stuff, and achieve your destiny. The question is "do the means justify the ends?"</p>
<p>This is, seriously, the core of almost every narrativist role-playing game. Sorcerer: "what will you do for power?" That's a specific application. The Riddle of Steel: "What is worth fighting and dying for?" Also a specific application.</p>
<p>So that's why Blue Rose is awesome to me. It's really easy-to-use narrativist role-playing.</p>
<p>Why is it not awesome? The setting is nerfed. There literally can be no internal conflict to fight hard to upload the ideals of Aldea against those who would change it, or make sacrifices to preserve other liberties or whatever. All the threats are external, really, and that's boring as heck to me. It is, however, easily fixed.</p>

<p>Mike,</p>
<p>It is, in fact. There are no experience points, and no real treasure, except that which suits the story. The reward system is very much not like D&amp;D in any way. There are levels, which you get when the GM says, "Ok, everyone level up." It's more of a measurement of the height of an adventure than a reward.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>So how would you denerf the setting?</blockquote>
My question exactly.<br/><br/>A few things I thought of: The protagonist country seems to be this place of beauty and perfect righteousness. That's boring. It would be more interesting to see it with a dash of fantasy "Dogs in the Vineyard": Everyone thinks they know what's Best and True, but everyone's agenda is sliiiightly different. And also put in more politics: There are politically powerful positions to be held, and you can take them the long (moral/good) way or the easy (ambition/"shadow") way, etc.                        </div>

                            I'm a big fan of Blue Rose for this as well as other reasons.  The Light/Twilight Nature and Conviction systems, in my opinion, simultaneously model the genre conventions of romantic fantasy in presenting both selfless and selfish impulses for characters and by stating, through Conviction, that characters can achieve most anything if they dedicate themselves, displaying a capacity for Simulationist genre emulation as well.   <br/>
<br/>
The Conviction mechanic is one that I place in the realm of 'dramatic currency' systems, such as Stunting in Exalted, Dramatic Editing in Adventure!, Mutants and Masterminds, Drama Dice in 7th Sea, and others.<br/>
<br/>
I say this because I presented a paper on this topic last year at the American Folklore Society, titled "Can I Get Change For That Plot Twist?:  Dramatic Currency for Communal Narrative Shaping in Role-Playing Games" and dramatic currency systems are some of my favorite bits in many recent RPGs, as they allow for a change in the balance of narrative control/agency within a role-playing game, exploring the territory between a Iron-Clad Ruling GM and a GM-less game like Universalis, Capes, or Polaris.<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to Blue Rose, I'd agree mostly on the setting.  It's built very shiny, with the Unenlightened Fundamentalists on one side and the Unmistakably Evil on another.  I think Aldea needs to be in more desperate straits from an internal standpoint with petty infighting ala Exalted's Scarlet Dynasty, that or the antagonists need to be less unmistakably *wrong* from the perspective of the written material.  (Though to be honest, I only read the Blue Rose main book and haven't more than skimmed the World of Aldea or Blue Rose Companion).                        </div>

<p>Michael,</p>
<p>We haven't met before, I think, but you are now on my radar. You are very correct, and also are presenting interesting papers.</p>
<p>Andy and others,</p>
<p>To denerf the setting: drop that deus ex machina, the magic deer. Now, I love the idea of it. But it is totally what messes up the game: the leader of the country is guaranteed, stamped by the gods, good. The nobles are pretty much that way, too.</p>
<p>To denerf with breaking canon: take that out. Make Aldea the place it is now, but with lots of internal strife about this. Up the immigrant angle - that one works. Keep the immigrants not liking the Aldean ideals, as you have to decide how to assimilate outsiders that don't like your way of life. Make opposition!</p>
<p>To denerf without breaking much canon: kill the deer as the situation. It's a giant group kicker. The deer is dead; someone did it and no one knows who; go!</p>

                            Wow, Clinton, I must have totally missed that reinforcement cycle.  As I remember it (books not at hand) you only got Conviction for pursuing your Light Nature, and pursuing your Dark Nature got you Corruption, which was a pretty gnarly death-spiral with few redeeming qualities.  I'll have to read up on it again.  That said, that cycle would go from neat to fucking awesome if there was some situation creation mechanics that set up the stuff you advise GMs to prepare.  I don't remember seeing anything like that in the book.  Still, that's lots closer to an interesting game than my prior understanding.<br/><br/>On the other hand, though, I have to completely disagree with you on the setting, which I find to be <em>fantastic</em>.  There's a lot of internal-to-Aldea conflict (I think that's what you were saying was lacking) -- the former King's son is angry and connected, there's "the Silence" organized crime organization, immigrants from many different backgrounds including the Evil Empires, and you have Darkfriends running amok wherever there's no a large concentration of Knights of the Rose.  Andy and Underwood, I think you're oversimplifying the utopian nature of Aldea; it's a utopia, sure, but it's beset from all sides and struggles against corruption from within.  It's the Federation; it's the Old Republic; it's Camelot; it's the good ol' U.S. of A. in pulp novels.  And the only people making sure that it stays a utopia are the Knights of the Rose AKA the PCs.  (In fact that's my largest annoyance with the game: it should have made Knights of the Rose the default character concept and just run with it, rather than set up this big elaborate setting with one giant and obvious PC slot and let you "choose.")                        </div>

Good at the time of coronation, it should be pointed out.  At least two chosen sovereigns went south after being coronated, if I recall correctly.  One got corrupted by sorcery/darkfiends, and one "went mad" which pretty much means whatever you need it to mean in your campaign.<br><br>Me, I just wonder at the Stag's motivations.

<p>Corruption can be a nasty death-cycle, or you can embrace it and go nuts and get bigger bonuses than you've ever seen. It's harder to get than you'd think, too. You can follow your Twilight nature and not get corrupted.</p>
<p>As for the setting: don't you literally get kicked in the head if you're the ruler and then you go south? That's where my patience wore thin: I kept thinking, "ok, it'll start good and then..." and BAM! kick in the head. I want people to have to make hard choices to keep up the enlightenment.</p>

                            The speed of response for the Stag and what actions are necessary for the Boot to the Head is something which wasn't clear to me from the book, and therefore leaves a great deal of room open for interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
If the Stag only does Boot to the Head if the sovereign is doing/has done something that will destroy the nation, it could be too litte, too late.  And as Joshua asked, what's up with the Stag?  The system in place basically puts the Stag's morality forward as the baseline/'normal,' but what if the Stag is dependant on the will of the people, and when Aldea is split on an issue, the Stag will wait, all the while allowing the sovereign to continue to slip up and let the nation fall apart?<br/>
<br/>
And more direclty in reponding to Joshua,<br/>
While I agree that the setting has the potential for all of these conflicts, the book didn't seem to me like it was pointing me towards those conflicts and possibilities, instead preparing me for a big game of monster fighting and Holy Roller correcting.  I think the setting of Blue Rose is constructed more homogenously than I would like to allow the Light/Shadow nature system with conviction to pay off as much as it could.  A world where several Aldea-like nations all thought they were the models of enligthenment while chastising one another or fighting over petty differences, Rezea one of them, while their conflict fuels the monsters on the edges, that I'd get more excited.<br/>
<br/>
Though truth be told, that's starting to sound like a mix of Dogs in the Vineyard and Legend of the Five Rings.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I'd totaly play a DitV hack "Samurai in the Clan War"                        </div>

This was exactly my impression, as well, which is why I discounted the game.  However, I may be so indie-indoctrinated these days that whenever I see a stat block for a monster I run fleeing in terror.  I pretty much concluded that if I was to run the game, I'd need to drift it away from the monster-bashing, but then it would be awesome.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MRUnderwood</cite>A world where several Aldea-like nations all thought they were the models of enligthenment while chastising one another or fighting over petty differences</blockquote>
There's room for that, though: Aldea is a confederation of many different subcultures.  The Islanders who practice plural marriages might have dust-ups with, say, the near-barbarians of the Weald.  Which is, again, a little bit of drift that would go a long way.                        </div>

I read some Actual Play from someone who played the Dogs in the Vineyard rules in the Blue Rose setting. As you pointed out, it sounds like a very good fit.                        </div>

                            For an interesting way to get good situation without removing Magic Deer, you needn't look any further than the Old Testament. The Magic Deer works in mysterious ways. Perhaps it would anoint a "bad king" as a chastisement to a fallen nation... The PCs as Jeremiahs in a decadent and corrupted Aldea strikes me as rockin' good fantasy melodrama.                        </div>

<p>JB,</p>
<p>I've read some True20, and I think Conviction's implementation is weakened by the genericization of the system, but you could bring it back.</p>
<p>(Note for all: the section we're talking about is actually p71-74.)</p>
<p>Joshua, I'll respectfully disagree with you, but minimally. I don't think it'd have to be interpreted: it's fairly clear what the system does and how to work it. No, I don't think they emphasize it. My understanding is that the book went through several authors and that some of the organizational problems stem from that.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>To denerf the setting: drop that deus ex machina, the magic deer. Now, I love the idea of it.

Dude, I completely disagree.  And really, I am sick of the complaining put up by people about this.  Yes, Blue Rose's Aldea is all girly and "nice".  This is a fundamental part of the genre.  If you don't like the fundamentals of Romantic Fantasy, then pick up the True20 rulebook and use the system with another setting.  It's not like the world of Aldea is a shining star otherwise.  There's plenty of dark fantasy game-worlds out there with as much angst as you could possibly want.  <br/><br/>What amazes me is why the Golden Hart should matter at all.  Does the succession of kingship within Aldis really matter so much to adventures in the setting?  How many adventures really are going to hinge on it?  A brief reading of the genre will generate tons of possible adventures in the setting all without involving the Golden Hart.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I am disappointed by the system in reflecting the genre -- moreso after a bit of play than in my first review of it.  I could go on a bit about the system, but that's probably best split off into another post.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I'm not sure that "girly and nice" is necessarily a fundamental part of the genre, if, as I've heard, it's based on such authors as Mercedes Lackey (who I stopped reading because her books were too angsty and dark for me) and Tamora Pierce (who's not at all girly; her strong female characters kick plenty butt and have to deal with all kinds of internal and external nastiness).<br/><br/>Anyway, back to your regularly scheduled thread.

                            Hm.  Sorry if I didn't make my point clear.  Aldea is a very close parallel to Lackey's Valdemar, which has telepathic Companions who ensure the essential goodness of the Heralds.  This doesn't prevent darkness in the stories or prevent the possibility of adventure.  Aldea's Golden Hart is actually far less intrusive than Valdemar's Companions, who are extremely numerous and constantly active throughout the kingdom.  <br/><br/>What bugs me is how insist upon mocking the Golden Hart and insisting that it is a fundamental problem for adventure.  <br/><br/>Tamora Pierce certainly has characters who kick butt (I'm thinking of Kel in particular -- a favorite of mine).  However, the adventures are not predicated on angst over the goodness of Tortall.  Kel had to deal with a lot of jerks along the way, but she still upheld the cause of the kingdom.  There's nothing in them I've read which would be hampered by the presence of the Golden Hart.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>JB,I've read some True20, and I think Conviction's implementation is weakened by the genericization of the system, but you could bring it back.</blockquote>
Green Ronin didn't include Corruption rules in True 20 because they felt it was too tied with Blue Rose. I think they could have included a modified, more generic mechanic as an option, but oh well... <br/><br/>In any case, there's no lack of madness/corruption mechanics for d20 in the market. ;-)<br/><br/>The best part about Conviction is that it can be endlessly tinkered with. For the Immortal Rome campaign I'm playing, we dropped the entire Virtue &amp; Vice rules. Instead, you get one at the end of each session, another one if the group thinks you were the best role-player, and a variable number of points when you take another immortal's Quickening (depending on who is higher level, you can go up a level or get Conviction points equal to your opponent's level).                        </div>
