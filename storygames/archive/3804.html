The first one took a while because I had to work the kinks out of the layout, but from that point on I'm just reusing an old one saved under a new file name.<br/><br/>It takes about two hours to write the stuff out. They've taken longer recently because the scenes without fights take longer to explain than the ones with lots o' butt kicking. I could definitely write less and still cover the info, but at least one of the players, and some folks on the net, have complimented me on them so I put in the work for my ego's sake. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Also, I have a really bad memory sometimes, but things I take the time to write up stick around better. So everything I add to the update increases the amount of little stuff I remember (and can look up if needed), thus helping out with campaign continuity and my ability to pull something out of their past to surprise them with.<br/><br/>Finding pictures takes a while too, depending on what they've done. For instance, the judge's photo was very easy (it's Clarence Thomas). the automaton in the most recent update is straight out of an Exalted book, so it was easy too. But finding a picture of someone strapped to a chair by barbed wire turned out to be impossible to I had to grab the next best thing: an emotive picture of a young girl staring out through a barbed wire fence, cropped enough to make the fact that it's a fence not immediately apparent. <br/><br/>But I've struck on an idea I want to try out: find the picture in advance. My wife digs around a lot for images on the net for some websites she frequents, and I've seen a bunch of cool ones over the ages too. So I figure I'll try to slip in details that use those photos. For instance, in the next few sessions they'll have a chance to step into a mirror world and visit a twisted version of the mansion they've been exploring. The path up to it has a garden, and it reminded me of <a href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Exalted/Images/pic.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>. So I added the hand to the description as being buried until fresh topsoil. If they dig the body up they'll find a corpse that looks just like their friend that died in the real world's version of this mansion.<br/><br/>I think they're worth it. I know my players read it most weeks, and at least two read it every week. The campaign tidbits for what's around them and what's out in the world have been helpful for showing them some of the setting without them having to travel there, and tell them about people they know without having to add long conversations between PCs and NPCs whose sole purpose is to say "this is who I am."<br/><br/>I knew it was completely worth it when a couple players were arguing about how something had gone down, and one of them quoted the update word-for-word to make his point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86732/#Comment_86732" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T16:05:09+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  4:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 4:05PM by James McMurray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some more, including last week's session.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Exalted/08-03-07.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF Version</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Exalted/08-03-07.doc" rel="nofollow">Word document</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Exalted/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Index of all past updates and links</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88202/#Comment_88202" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T13:10:55+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  1:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2007 1:11PM by James McMurray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And some more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Exalted/08-10-07.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF Version</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Exalted/08-10-07.doc" rel="nofollow">Word document</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Exalted/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Index of all past updates and links</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if anyone reads this, let me know.
