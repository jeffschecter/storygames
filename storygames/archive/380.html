                    I'm playtesting a game (<a href="http://www.primevalpress.com/games/utopia" rel="nofollow">Utopia</a>) that has an interesting resolution scheme. It may be a form of conflict resolution, but maybe it's different enough to gets its own label.<br/><br/>It goes like this. 
<ul>
<li>A conflict is initiated by a PC making a decision or taking an action that might have major repurcussions.</li>
<li>That action/decision is not in question. In either case, a long-term hope is also named, such that the decision or action is hoped to advance that cause in some way.</li>
<li>The resolution mechanics are invoked. They answer the question, "What are the consequences of your action?" If you roll low, then your action will backfire and actually harm you, mostly in terms of the long-term hope. If you roll well, you'll take a big step towards it.</li>
<li>Knowing the roll result, the context of the roll, and the named hope, a narrator describes something which makes the roll result come true. The exact form of good or bad consequences is up to him, however.</li>
</ul>
Here's an example.<br/><br/>My character has an audience with a foreign king. I say that he greets the king and makes a fine speech, praising his domain. Everyone acknowledges that this occurs (there is a way to challenge it). Someone says that this should be a conflict, and I agree. I say that my goal is to get the king's help in a war. Here's what someone might narrate, based on different roll results.<br/><br/>Kinda good roll: The king is impressed, and gives you some gifts. He also promises to send a retinue to escort you through the rest of his domain.<br/><br/>Bad roll: The king gives gifts to you and makes promises, but actually orders his leiutenant to murder you in your beds.<br/><br/>Really good roll: The king pledges to support your war effort, and immediately musters 200 of his best men.<br/><br/><br/>Is this conflit resolution? We're naming a kind of stakes up front, but only in vague terms. What we fill in, with narration, are the actual consequences, as well as how we get them (unlike a lot of Conflict Res). My character's actions are already fixed before resolution is invoked, unlike Conflict or Task resolution (at least as I know them).<br/><br/>Obviously, classifying the scheme won't change it, but I'm curious what people think. And I want to know if it seems cool or problematic too, of course.                </div>

<p>Sounds like Conflict Resolution to me, but with one cycle of resolution lasting a <strong>long</strong> time.  Like maybe longer than the game.</p>
<p>The stakes are "Do I get the kings help in the war?" or possibly even "Do we win the war?"  The audience with the king is only one step in resolving those stakes (unless you roll so well that the stakes are resolved in an instant).</p>
<p>It's a little fuzzy, though.  It'd be a lot clearer if the rolls actually added up so that you <em>knew</em> for certain when either the goal had been achieved or when it never could be.</p>

                            The interesting thing is that you could put normal conflict resolution, or those non-conflict Targets, inside of this. <br/>
Though you would almost certainly want to define what it takes to add up to resolve the goal, yes,  maybe in terms of real play units - scenes, sessions, or etc.<br/>
<br/>
You could use it to do something like, say, outline the goal of a whole play session, so that you have this idea of what you are working for.<br/>
<br/>
You know, like "Judge this Town, Dog" - which is already there, in that game, of course!  ;)                        </div>

                            Yeah, I can definitely see it as a very extended conflict resolution. There's one thing that bugs me about that though: it seems strange to put other happenings chronologically between the conflict's outset and resolution, even though they have nothing to do with it. Because we might have multiple long-term goals going at once. <br/><br/>Doesn't Vincent say the resolution in Dogs is really multiple resolutions which then get combined? I guess that's about the same thing, in different words.<br/><br/>I was actually thinking of keeping track of goal progress somehow. The thing is, these goals/hopes aren't really formal, and might change slightly from conflict roll to conflict roll. But what <em>is</em> stable are sessions-long "Threats" that the GM poses and which, uh, threaten the PCs' society. Keeping track of how close the threat is to being difused could certainly work...I think some subjective judgment is going to have to enter though, because not all conflicts will really directly impact a single threat. I'm also cautious now about reducing everything to numbers: there needs to be a two-way interface with the fiction.                        </div>

<p>Capes does fine with multiple goals running at once (and against each other).  Personally, I think it's a strength:  so much so that my next game, Misery Bubblegum, will have concurrent goals that run so long that you may well <em>not be able to finish them</em> in a session.  Stuff like "Dave and Maddie hook up" from Moonlighting ... a goal characterized by the fact that, week after week, they fail to resolve it.</p>
<p>I don't quite get why you think that attaching numbers to something means "reducing it to numbers."  Could you elaborate?</p>

                            Sure, I can try.<br/><br/>I mean that I don't want an involved numerical game which fiction is hung loosely over...where players could conceivably ignore fiction and just play with number--not that anyone would do that, but the possibility is indicative. Instead, the fiction has be fed by, and also feed, the pure numerical aspects of the game.<br/><br/>It's like Vincent's diagrams, with arrows going into and out of the poofy clouds, interfacing with dice. There has to be a two-way interaction, so that as a player I'm not merely <em>interpreting</em> numbers in terms of fiction, but am using them to alter the fiction which then (separately) re-engages the numbers.<br/><br/>Does that make any more sense?                        </div>

                            I just had a flash in my mind for a website:<br/><br/>"www.amiconflictresolutionornot.com", like the old "Am I Hot or Not" website<br/><br/>In it, you see pictures of roleplaying games, and underneath each is a target number from 1 to 10, 1 being Conflict Resolution, and 10 being Something Else, and you rate each game. That would make it decisive.                        </div>
