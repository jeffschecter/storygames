Time to throw a question out into the aether and see what stirs...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a member of a weekly RPG club which predominantly plays D20, D6 and the like...large established mainstream games basically. Now, I have absolutely no problems with what RPG I play, as long as we're all having a good time. Saying that, my gaming interests definately err on the side of indie games and I have found that my enjoyment of such traditional gaming is definately on the wane.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I have attempted to (softly, softly) introduce a more eclectic mix of games into the weekly sessions, on the whole the responses to Burning Wheel and Inspectres (I know, from one extreme to the other) has been definately muted and very varied amongst the group. From five players the responses ranged from "so...when do we kill something?" to "it's ok as  a one-off, but I couldn't see us playing it every week..." Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, I have mooted the idea of a monthly "Indie expo" whereby all who are interested choose, via discussion and vote, a story game which I own for me to run (as a one-shot). I have pitched this as a relaxed, turn-up-and-roleplay session for them to try a variety of games and to see if they like the game and try something different. It also serves to seperate those players who game weekly and have no interest in such indie/story games...which I have no problem with, and those open to something different from the weekly norm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have put together a post for the clubs forum describing the twenty-odd games I own in order to start generating interest and discussion and then the phrase 'story game' came up. This is where I actually get to the point of the post (still with my rambling?) I have read the "What is story games" post, but felt that with the wide range of games which I own I would like to expand the definition for my group (who look blankly when I mention story games). Therefore I'd like to post my definition that I've put on my post and get your reaction and input.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want story gaming to come across as either pretentious or elitist, rather that it is merely a different approach to gaming...<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><i>A story game can be differentiated from other roleplaying games in that individual character development is secondary to the story created by the players and GM as a group. While this can occur within any roleplaying game, in the games above it is, to a varying degree, hardwired into the games systems themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven where the games have high levels of intra-party competitiveness built in, such as Agon, Cold City, Elfs or Shab-al-Hiri Roach, it is not the act of one individual winning which is important, rather it is the collaborative story which emerges which takes centre stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the games here would be seen as story games, and as such provide the player with far greater narrative control than more traditional roleplaying games. The players can find themselves on an increasingly equal narrative footing with the GM, with varying levels dependent on the individual game in question. For example I would imagine that Burning Wheel has low levels of shared narrative, while Universalis is a totally shared narrative. </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAny comments, critiques or suggestions you could provide so as to make this clearer (or even necessary) would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63180/#Comment_63180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-07T03:40:25+00:00" title="April  7, 2007  3:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi John,<br><br>I think your idea of a monthly 'turn up and play if you like' style of thing is a good one and lets people sample games that they might not otherwise try, if they are interested. It's a low key, non-intrusive way of doing things. Those who prefer to stick to familiar territory can do so with ease, those who might wnat to sample something for a single session can also drop in and drop out easily.<br><br>As for your 'pitch', the only thing I might take out is over-use of the word 'narrative'. I know it's a term that's used easily and freely around here, but for some it might be confusing (simply because it is not a term they have encountered in gaming) or spark off the (unwarranted) 'uh oh, this sounds like elitist indie gaming wankery!' radar! Don't get me wrong, I like the term narrative and find it useful. But others might not. Why not just use the term 'story'? Or 'fiction'? Everyone is familiar with fiction. I think.<br><br>Overall though, I think it's a great idea and kudos to you for doing it. By the way, if there's anything I can do to help, do let me know.<br><br>Cheers<br>Malcolm                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63182/#Comment_63182" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-07T04:50:16+00:00" title="April  7, 2007  4:50AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2007 4:53AM by John Anderson.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Malcolm,<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, I'm sorry to hear about your job.

In an ideal world I would see where people's interested lay (I have put up a list with links to the game's website and a short blurb about the games) and go from there...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I think (in the real world) that if everyone wanted a one-off of Burning Empires I'd be certainly starting off in the deep end. Realistically, I'd would prefer to start at the 'lighter' end of the complexity scale. Thinking in terms of the games which would allow for a rapid and interactive character generation, are tightly focused and can be easily explained, and yet also allow a quick take-off into the game, I'd start with...(in no particular order)<br/>\nAgon, SoTC, Cold City, Donjon, Elfs, InSpectres...etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially, I'd prefer to try and encourage this end of the scale. Lighter in rules and tone while still introducing the story-games elements. Hopefully it would be an organic process with naturally increasing narrative involvement which wasn't immediately obvious. More of a "Oh, that was cool" rather than a "What? You want me to do what?"<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63202/#Comment_63202" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-07T11:22:52+00:00" title="April  7, 2007 11:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I try to keep things really super simple, but that's not necessarily good for advertising.<br><br>"Story games are games in which the first priority of play is creating a fun story together."<br><br>That includes a lot of D&amp;D and d6 and GURPS and Storyteller games, though, so not everyone here buys into that definition.<br><br>i can't control what they do, this is the burden of always being right about everything.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63214/#Comment_63214" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-07T17:40:07+00:00" title="April  7, 2007  5:40PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really uncomfortable with compartmentalization myself.

Actual play is the best evangelism tool, if you are trying to turn people on to something new.  Anybody who takes a risk on a weirdo game and has a good time will return with a friend.  Trying to explain why it is special outside the context of actual play seems like a fool's errand to me.

The full forum advert features (primarily) descriptions of the kick-ass settings of the games rather that any in depth analysis of the structural niceties of game A vs game B. It is a conscious effort to sell setting over structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince being with the current group, they have played in pre-established, pre-constructed settings playing "traditional" adventures which have been laid out for the characters to navagate. The games I have participated in have been either published adventures or GM written and so linear that deviation from the 'script' is heavily frowned upon and causes all sorts of chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I've said, my advert doesn't mention system at all but the phrase 'story game' kept cropping up and I wanted to include a brief  intro as to the sort of game the sessions were aimed at. I will definately be doing as Andy suggested but without systemic information. Yes, system matters, but I think the strong and highly focused settings and situations will be more of a draw.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
