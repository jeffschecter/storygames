                    I'm starting a Mu campaign this coming Tuesday, so this isn't so much an Actual Play step as a "here I am, leading up to this game" thing, for the moment.  I'll post more to this as the play experience unfolds, but for now, here are the things I've sent to my players.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><i>Hail!<br/><br/>  The Dictionary of Mu may be my favorite game (supplement)  in recent memory. I intend to run a game of it.<br/><br/>  For this game, I need people who are willing to commit some dark deeds, either in the name of saving or dooming a dying planet.<br/><br/>  I need people who are willing to take some time between games to write new entries in the Dictionary of Mu; in this game, it's the only way you get advancement.<br/><br/>  I need people who are willing to rise as heroes against all dark adversity, or commit to unending villainy for all the good-intentioned right reasons in the world.<br/><br/>  I need people who are willing to invest in a story without reservation, who know that it's not a question of pain tolerance, it's a question of painlessness intolerance.<br/><br/>  I need people who are willing to dive into the abyss as their final defiant hope-clinging act, cackling all the way to the bottom.<br/><br/>  I need you.<br/><br/>  Character creation starts Tuesday.<br/><br/>  We run for as many Tuesdays as we can stand, until the Devilexicon opens and its bane spreads across the land, until the skies open up, the stars fall, and a new aeon is ushered in on the bloodied remains of your conquests -- or yourselves.<br/><br/>  Join me.<br/><br/>Fred</i><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>I'm probably going to be doing a *mild* rules-hack, in that I've gone and created a map of of Marr'd, based partly on actual Martian geography, some artistic license, and a close reading of the geographic cues that *are* provided in the Mu text.  I've discussed this with Judd; while he's generally against the idea of putting a map of Marr'd out there in the world, I think I'm addressing the concerns in my specific case.  The players I'm playing with have actively contributed to building the map of the world before, in a previous Amber campaign I ran, to very good effect, so I'm looking for the map to be just as vital of a document as the Dictionary itself, with the players able to contribute to the geography of the world.<br/><br/>I've chosen 'Baltar's Dream', the second track off of the Battlestar Galactica second season soundtrack, because, Oh My God, That's Marr'd<br/><br/>I mailed out the descriptors to the players today, so they can get their brains percolating on what ones strike their fancy.<br/><br/>More, after Tuesday.                </div>

                            No worries, man.<br/><br/>Right now one of my guys has come back with these as his descriptors of interest:<br/><br/>Stamina: Atlantean-Bred.  Will: Spoiled Atlantean.  Lore: Solar Schooled.  Past: Solar Slayer.<br/><br/>The Past thing is of his own invention and I'm challenging him to tell me what he thinks it means.  I may encourage him to think about making his kicker a crash-landing, and then throwing the map at him and saying "Show me where."<br/><br/>Another player is eyeing Arcadia.  At seeing the line about why they don't want to leave "this red rock", her immediate thought was "Because there's something UNDER this Red Rock".<br/><br/>Fantastic.                        </div>

                            Well, since Judd's okay with the map being more generally "out there"...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.iago.net/mu/marrd-partial-map.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.iago.net/mu/marrd-partial-map.jpg</a><br/><br/>I'm also working on creating a very pretty character sheet for the game, but we'll have to see how that goes -- I'll probably want to run it by Judd before I put it out there.                        </div>

I'm doing my job right, then.<br/><br/>These are just the pre-selections of descriptors.  Three of the four players will be sitting down with me tomorrow to stat their characters up proper and maybe run a few scenes in order to build rules-fu.                        </div>

Hee-yow<br/><br/>[15:07] Rob: But man, what a magnificent Demon it would be<br/><br/>[15:07] Fred: Oh, fuck yeah. No question.<br/><br/>[15:08] Fred: Just... um. Ouch.<br/><br/>[15:09] Rob: Oh, sure. But it's not the power that's the interesting part.  The relationship _should_ suck.<br/><br/>[15:10] Fred: Heh. Demon'll get a huge die advantage almost certainly (unless there's a fluke roll -- which is possible)<br/><br/>[15:11] Fred: I'm almost tempted to suggest that you make finding out the truth about the Ocean a kicker rather than a starting demon, but we could go however you want<br/><br/>[15:11] Fred: I'd be sad about losing your story of the invisible city tho<br/><br/>[15:11] Rob: Sure, but the Ocean's story is absolutely intriguging as a motivation of play<br/><br/>[15:12] Rob: I'm sticking with the invisible city for now, but Ocean's definately a strong second runner<br/><br/>[15:14] Fred: I can guarantee you I'll make the Ocean matter in the story if it's grabbing you like that<br/><br/>[15:14] Rob: Yeah<br/><br/>[15:15] Rob: Oh, I have no lack of confidence that the Ocean thing could work.  I'm just _also_ quite taken by the invisible city<br/><br/>[15:16] Rob: Especially because the more I think about NOT KNOWING if the people I end there are really going to the happy place i remember seems delicious.<br/><br/>[15:18] Fred: Yeah<br/><br/>[15:18] Fred: And your demon doesn't want you going back there<br/><br/>[15:18] Fred: You're supposed to be its herald<br/><br/>[15:18] Fred: That means going out in the world<br/><br/>[15:18] Rob: Precisely<br/><br/>[15:19] Rob: WHich is even more wonderfully double edged because it really is _all_ about faith.<br/><br/>[15:19] Rob: And the very nature of the unprovable<br/><br/>[15:20] Rob: Thus, Delicious.                        </div>

                            Revealing that my typing is even _worse_ in IM. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Worth noting that my sorcerer has the ever-empty purse, full of brilliant multicolored coins of some translucent material  which can only be seen or really interacted with if you _believe_ the story of Kitezh, the invisible city.  He is the herald of Kitezh and his demon is its story, which wants to be told so that those who hear will dream of Kitezh and seek it out.  To those who can see the coins, he makes gifts of them to help lead them to the city that he, as the Herald, may never return to.<br/><br/>In the story, Kitezh is a beautiful, safe place, and he really believes he's sending them to a better place than Marr'd, but the only thing he can truly know is that they go, and they do not return, and all else must be taken on faith.<br/><br/>Very much looking forward to actually doing chargen and crafting a kicker tonight.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Okay, I'm goin' in.  I'm expecting tonight to focus mainly on character creation, though we might get some play in if we're lucky.  3 of 4 players will be in attendance.  Right now we're looking at a potential space-pilot-god-slayer, a herald of an invisible city that he can never return to, and a sometime ally of the witch-king schooled in the towers of stygia.  Maybe.  We'll see where all that goes.                        </div>

                            Added note: Kai learned his sorcery by wandering through the Red Wastes.  He grew more insane and hopeless as time went on and, eventually, collapsed.  He woke to find himself in Kitezh, the invisible city, found on an island in the midst of a glittering ocean.  It was a place of beauty, but incredible loneliness, for Kai had left his lady-love (not the Damsel) behind when he entered the wastes.<br/><br/>The Tale of Kitezh came and found him, then, and offered him safe passage back out of the city and the Wastes, in exchange for being told and retold, to get other believers to come to Kitezh.  Their bargain was made (binding strength -2, favoring the demon), and the Tale brought Kai back out of the Wastes -- but when he emerged, he discovered 100 years had passed since he entered, and his love was long since dead.                        </div>

                            Lydia's character (she is easily the darkest player I have; I've nearly never been able to turn the dial dark enough to put her off; she eats it up).<br/><br/>KOR-ELUD<br/><br/>Appearance: Taul, gaunt, and dark.  A young man full of hauteur.<br/><br/>Telltale: Wears a belt of varied skulls.<br/><br/>Will - 3 (Born to Rule)<br/>Stamina - 2 (Black-Rock Born)<br/>Lore - 5 (Stygian Schooled, Blood of the Old Ones)<br/>Past - 3 (Stygian Witch-Lord)<br/>Humanity - 2 -- Failed his humanity test after binding his first demon<br/><br/>Price: Prideful (-1 to all interactions when dealing with people who are <i>not</i> of at least equal or greater standing)<br/><br/>Kicker: The ritual with your sister was simply a test of your powers.  You are ready to strike him down, to beat his flesh until it flows like metal, to forge him into a weapon of your own.  Today is the day you kill your master and take his seat as the new Witch Lord of this province.<br/><br/>Background: Kor-Elud's first demon is his younger sister, Lyra.  He bedded her, murdered her at the culmination of the act, called her back from beyond the grave, and bound her to his service as a seductress-assassin.<br/><br/>LYRA (Binding Strength -1, favoring the demon)<br/><br/>Type - Passer<br/>Appearance - She has Kor-Elud's lithe form, but the similarities end there.  Her body is prematurely lush and irresistable, calling to mind both innocence, and the enthusiastic, passionate discarding of it.<br/>Telltale - Slightly pointed teeth<br/><br/>Stamina - 4<br/>Lore - 5<br/>Will - 6<br/>Power - 6<br/><br/>Desire - Corruption<br/>Need - She misses her innocence from before her brother's touch terribly, and must be allowed to partake in acts that "regain" her lost childhood through play and other childish things.  (Sadly, her Desire often causes such things to end badly, but what can you do?)<br/><br/>Abilities: Cover, Hold, Confuse, Daze, Psychic Force                        </div>

                            THROSH (currently acting with the name MERKURE)<br/><br/>Appearance - Perfect in face and form, a true-bred Atlantean, exquisitely muscled, flawless of skin, bred for combat.<br/>Telltale - Suffused with silver (see his demon)<br/><br/>Stamina - 5 (Atlantean-Trained, Olymon-Born)<br/>Will - 3 (Spoiled Atlantean)<br/>Lore - 2 (Solar Schooled)<br/>Past - 5 (Solar Slayer)<br/>Humanity - 5<br/><br/>Price: Glory Whore (-1 when fighting without an audience)<br/><br/>Kicker: A dead god churns angrily in your veins.  You realize too late that even a god is not a Farrow, and your return to Marr'd will be in a firey, broken ship streaking out of the heavens.  Red sands race beneath you; it is mere seconds before impact, and without Merkure's aid, you will not survive.<br/><br/>Background: Brought forth from an Atlantean birthing vat at the peak of Olymon, the son to Atlantean slavers, Throsh was raised to be one worthy to master gods.  Seeking the truth of the Riddle of Silver, he claimed a small voidship and its Farrow and travelled to Merkure, home of the god Merkure.  There he learned the ways of Sorcery from the god and, when he was ready, the god revealed the Riddle of Silver to him.  Throsh was displeased -- so thoroughly that he drew his crystal sword on the god and fought him immediately (to this day, he will not speak of the Riddle the god spoke).  Merkure fell before his fury and Atlantean weaponry, but killed Throsh's Farrow in the process.  Throsh pried open Merkure's chest and drank his silver blood, even as Merkure's blood, not entirely dead, tried to drown him.  But Throsh was the better one, forcing his own blood out and replacing it with Merkure's own.  (Throsh now plans to claim the name Merkure as his own and demand tribute and worship from Merkure's small but fantastically wealthy flock.)<br/><br/>MERKURE (Binding Strength -1, favoring the demon -- it could have been worse, but the player rolled quite well)<br/><br/>Merkure is the silvery blood of a dead god.  The infected is at times transformed into the giant aspect of the god himself, wreathed in flame, fast as thought.<br/><br/>Type - Parasite<br/>Appearance - Silvery liquid blood<br/>Telltale - Infected person bleeds silver<br/><br/>Stamina - 9<br/>Lore - 8<br/>Will - 10<br/>Power - 10<br/><br/>Abilities: Armor (Sorcerer), Big (Sorcerer), Fast (Sorcerer), Shapeshift (Sorcerer), Vitality (Sorcerer), Protection (vs Energy), Special Damage (Fire), Warp                        </div>

                            I realized as I was driving home that our PCs are effectively Thoth-Amon, Cugel the Clever and for all intents and purposes a Solar Exalt.  Craziness.  I can't wait for our fourth.<br/><br/>I was also thinking this morning that I think the dictionary format has, in addition to being awesome to read, made it much easier to seize ownership of elements of the setting because the dependancies are more immediately obvious.  Clearly, the fact that there is only a finite amount of material and there is no concern that breaking things will cause problems when "Return to Dictionary of Mu" comes out both play into this as well.  However, I really think the dictionary format goes a long way towards enabling players to reach into the bag, grab something, and put their mark on it.  It's the discrete elements that really do it, I think.<br/><br/>And that is, of course, awesome.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I manually drew the arrows, which may disappoint you.<br/><br/>But I did it up in InDesign.  Each character is a text frame containing a table superimposed on a glyph (using the Dingura font, which is in use throughout the character sheets I did and in the game itself), and drop shadows added to both.  Drew the arrows as lines using the pen tool, and added an arrowhead to the end of the line.  Added another text frame on top of the lines (tried putting type directly on the path, but that didn't produce an end result I liked) to state the nature of the relationship.<br/><br/>Not much to it besides that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            We finished our first session of Dictionary of Mu tonight.<br/><br/>Here's the story of the fourth character, including tonight's play:<br/><br/><b>The Story of Fayze, the Heretic Thief of Arcadia</b><br/><br/>Fayze has broken the Thirteenth Seal, one of the 13 seals that is holding the angry spirit of Marr'd prisoner underneath Arcadia.  From its broken remains she has summoned and bound The Seal by sewing it into her skin where it now sends its runes out through her ritual tattoos.  Once a faithful Seal Guardian of Arcadia, she has decided that the new Aeon must be ushered in by freeing Marr'd to scour the face of the world; only by ending the current Age of Despair can she see that a new Golden Age is ushered in.<br/><br/>The problem is that her seal-mates don't see it that way.  Her story opens with the Priest Mother and Priest Father and the six most loyal Seal-Guards coming upon her as she tries to put a forgery of the Thirteenth back in place.  They demand she stand down.  She tries to reason with them.  It does not work.  She is beaten senseless and dragged off to a cell.  Since the Seal heals all her wounds easily, they lock her up with the intent to starve her to death while they try to undo what she's done.<br/><br/>The Seal, a demon whose Need is to break the faith of others, and which can see into the past of things, shows her how one of the ancient architects of her cell was afraid he'd be locked up in it some day, and buried a key in a secret place so he might escape easily.  So she escapes, and makes it to Brazael's quarters, one of her sealmates who did not stand against her earlier.  Brazael's resentment of the Priest Mother and Father is strong, and thus, her faith is weak.  Fayze convinces Brazael that the teachings of Arcadia are a lie, that Fayze indeed knows the true way, and in so breaking Brazael's earlier faith, feeds her demon.<br/><br/>Brazael then works to help Fayze escape, getting her a disguise and getting the both of them to the gate.  But tragedy strikes -- Brazael is shot through the heart with an arrow.  Brazael falls, begging Fayze not to leave her.  In a rage, Fayze pulls the outer wall of Arcadia down behind them, blocking the pursuers, and carries Brazael off into the northern twilight desert.<br/><br/>There, in a cave, she tries to give Brazael medical attention.  Fayze says to her, "If your new faith is strong, it will sustain you. Believe." Brazael's eyes find Fayze's face, and as the color drains out of her, she reaches a weak hand to touch Fayze's cheek, and says, "I believe in you." And she slips away... <br/><br/>... and only Fayze's summoning of a demon can save her. It's that, or let her friend die.<br/><br/>Fayze calls upon her memories of past lives and digs in the dry dead soil outside until she finds her prize: an acorn, withered.  She contacts the spirit of the life it once contained.  <br/><br/>"What place will you make fertile in payment for my service?" asks the spirit. Fayze takes but a moment to respond: "My friend."<br/><br/>She sumons the spirit to her, and the acorn doubles in size, alive and vital with a faint heartbeat.  She binds it to her will.  The spirit says to her, "Place me within her and she will be healed." Fayze considers a moment, and then puts it in Brazael's mouth.<br/><br/>Brazael's eyes fly open; her wounds heal; she sits upright. "I believe!"<br/><br/>Cut to black.<br/><br/>[More to come]                        </div>

Kor-Elud decides that merely taking everyone out of the picture, at least temporarily, is the way to go if he's to achieve his aims.  The party tonight offers an excellent opportunity to circulate some mildly-drugged wine to get everyone happy and forgetful.  Naturally Kor has made certain to develop an immunity to this drug months in advance.<br/><br/>Kor sends his demon -- his oversexed young sister, murdered and then bound by his hand -- to the master's chambers to seduce him.  It works, for the master's appetites are many.  In the height of passion, Kor reveals himself, dagger in hand, and goes to put it through the master's heart.  His master's demon alerts him, and Kor's sister is unable to use her powers to hold him fast; she's flung aside like a wet rag.  The master lashes out with his demon's power as lightning, and Kor plunges the dagger home.  Both take terrible damage -- the master, fatally.  He knows he's going to die as soon as the demon's power drops from him, and a somewhat charred Kor lies helpless on the floor as his master looms over him, raising his hand in crackling fury.  "At least it will be the both of us, Kor-Elud", he says.<br/><br/>But then the master's thunder-demon Thundrazor speaks: "Bind me to you, here and now, and his blow will not land." Kor says, simply, "Agreed." and all of the vitality that Thundrazor lent the master leaves him, and shortly, so does the entirety of his blood.  <br/><br/>But the binding Kor has made in desperation is a terribly strong one (binding strength EIGHT due to a total victory on the demon's part), and the demon is in no mood to let Kor have his easy way of things.    "Feed me both of your fellow students, now," demands the demon.  Kor begs for a brief respite, and gets it, so he might recover from his injuries.  In the binding, Thundrazor has been placed into a dagger; Kor places the dagger upon the mantle. "Wait here.  I will bring them to you."<br/><br/>Kor then desperately brokers a deal with the apprentices.  They will help him banish this demon -- by force instead of ritual if necessary -- in exchange for certain favors of his as he takes his post as the new Witch Lord.  Xar-Xaal, the elder apprentice, has been caught in an affair with Amaela, one of the Witch King's brides.  In exchange for secrecy, security, and shelter, he will help.  Vash-Trun, the eager, youngest apprentice obsessed with board games, will help for the learning experience.  They venture forth to confront Thundrazor.<br/><br/>Their rituals of containment are no good, and the demon comes for them, blowing the door of the master's chamber off its hinges.  They unleash everything at them -- Vash-Trun tries to trap the demon's mind within his Games, Xar-Xaal calls upon his demon Drizzle to suck the moisture out of Thundrazor's clouds, and Kor's sister Lyra does her best to rip Thundrazor's mind apart.<br/><br/>They all fail, and Thundrazor says, "Now, my turn."<br/><br/>Thundrazor attacks Kor viciously with another bolt of lightning -- despite attempting to ground the bolt out in a metal sword driven to the ground, Kor still takes the brunt of it, and lies insensate in the corridor.  This, however, creates an opening: Vash-Trun's Game traps part of Thundrazor within it, and Drizzle rips all the clouds-breath from the demon, rendering it into nothing.  The demon evaporates in a wail of rage, and is no more.<br/><br/>Vash-Trun, no longer looking so young nor naive, turns to look at Kor as he lies upon the ground. "Well," he observes. "That turned out better than we'd planned."<br/><br/>Xar-Xaal says, quietly, "Mm. Yes."<br/><br/>Cut to black.<br/><br/>[more to come]                        </div>

<b>The Entwined Stories of Kai, Herald of Invisible Kitezh, and Throsh, the Solar Slayer Reborn as the Dead God Merkure</b><br/><br/>In Battlehymn, Kai wakes in the Damsel Messiah's bed, with her serpent coiled at its foot.  Both are sleeping.  Kai grabs his bundle of clothes and quietly makes it to the balcony, intending to scale down to the street below.  But beneath the balcony are hundreds of worshippers.  He ducks out of sight (and pulls on his pants) while he works on a plan B.<br/><br/>Calling upon The Story of Invisible Kitezh, he finds a secret way behind one of the tapestries, and opens it, quietly.  As he makes his way through the passage in darkness, he hears through the walls two others conspiring.<br/><br/>"Do you think they are done yet?  He seemed quite eager."<br/>"Well, the ritual does take some time."<br/>"She does not have much life left, here with us.  If this does not produce an heir..."<br/>"If this does not produce an heir, she will do as a martyr."<br/>"Don't speak such things!"<br/>"We have our ways.  Worry not."<br/><br/>Kai struggles for a moment, but knows the Damsel Messiah is quite capable of taking care of herself; and in the end, he thinks he would make a poorer father than no father at all.  So he moves on.<br/><br/>High in the skies over the surface of Marr'd, Throsh, the Solar Slayer, and recent murderer of Merkure, God of Wealth, hurtles into the atmosphere, pointed the wrong way entirely.  His craft begins to melt around him, and the silver blood of the dead god churns angrily in his veins.  <br/><br/>"It would be better for the both of us if I lived, you know."<br/>"Bah!  At least my final moments will be to see you burned to carbon ash!"<br/><br/>The craft begins to burn with the light of a new star.<br/><br/>"But I can spread the message of your faith.  It has faded from this world."<br/>"Hnf! Very well, there is a place where the faith is all but lost in the face of a heretic religion.  Go there, and convert them."<br/>"Done!"<br/><br/>In the skies over Battlehymn, the light grows to the fury of an angry sun.  Kai emerges from an unseen opening in the wall of the palace.  He looks to the sky, shielding his eyes.<br/><br/>"Hang on, then, my 'master'," snarls Merkure.  "This will hurt a bit."<br/><br/>And THOOM.  There is a shockwave, knocking everyone to their feet -- Kai included -- as the craft buries itself in the red desert dirt not half a mile outside Battlehymn.  Kai gets to his feet and, naturally, concludes that he should go find out what did that.  Throsh, meanwhile, attempts to gather himself from the monumental amounts of pain he just endured and pry himself out of the wreckage of his craft.<br/><br/>A lone figure (Kai) approaches him from Battlehymn, hailing him.  Throsh hails him back: "I am the god Merkure, come to bring my faith to Battlehymn!"  Kai's not buying it for a moment, but he decides to play along.  Playing in his role as herald, Kai introduces Throsh (as Merkure) to the populace; it is a most effective introduction, and several wealthy, well-appointed types -- usually members of Merkure's flock -- approach, carefully. "Come to our place; we must not be seen here!"<br/><br/>The merchants hail Merkure's return, and unveil all their secret artifacts of worship.  They beg for Merkure's forgiveness and assistance in bringing the faith back to Battlehymn and Hy-Brasil.  Kai, quietly and elsewhere, makes sure a message makes its way to the Messiah's palace.  The merchants meanwhile ask Merkure why he is keeping company with the Messiah's Impregnator.  Kai returns and he and Merkure have an awkward conversation for a few minutes.<br/><br/>And then the knocking comes at the door. It's the Damsel Messiah with the army of the faithful at her back.  Some posturing commences, with both the Damsel and Merkure demanding that each kneel to the other.  It's a brief impasse, and then Throsh summons the full aspect of Merkure into him, growing to a towering height and wreathing himself in flame.  He proclaims himself as the god Merkure here to bring faith back to the masses.  The Damsel in turn quietly, but clearly and confidently, professes her own faith.  And Kai turns to the crowd and speaks of a middle path, where both faiths might live together stronger, in unity.  (As it worked out, each of these folks were targeting the crowd, and none of their goals directly opposed one another, and they all won their rolls against the crowd by a MILE.  So the faith in Merkure gains a great spark, the Faithful see their zealotry well-defended, and Kai's speech on unity gives them the greatest hope of all -- for which he rolls a humanity gain test, and succeeds.) Sotto voce, Kai suggests to the Damsel that Merkure might be the way for her and her 144,000 faithful to find a way off of Marr'd and on to a place of plenty.<br/><br/>A proposal is made: in a few hours' time, Merkure and the Messiah will meet in a theater nearby, each taking one of its grand entrances as his or her own, entering as equals, to discuss how they might join their two faiths towards a common purpose.<br/><br/>Fade there.                        </div>

                            And that's it for the play summary of tonight.  It's very clear I still need to figure out how to run combat in Sorcerer, because, at least as far as the mechanical stuff went, that's the stuff I flubbed the most.  Most of the rest of the speed bumps were merely a lack of familiarity that lead to a lot of page-flipping and index-referencing.<br/><br/>As a setting, Dictionary of Mu is bloody flawless (and flawlessly bloody).  I strongly recommend that you buy this for the setting REGARDLESS of what system you might want to run it with.  It's that pretty, and it's that good.  It's like a pressure cooker for generating madly wonderful sword'n'sorcery chock full of bloody, brutal pulp.                        </div>

Lemme just echo that.  I picked up the Dictionary of Mu the other day at <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com" rel="nofollow">EndGame</a>, and am hugely impressed.  I've long been a fan of Sorcerer and the S&amp;S supplement.  Dictionary of Mu really just kicks it into high gear.  Fantastic stuff, and a great package that challenges the reader a bit (in a positive sense).<br/><br/>Fred - thanks for the actual play examples.  Now, I know you're going to share <b>blanks</b> of those character and demon sheets, right?  Right?                        </div>

This was the bedtime book I read to my wife over the course of a week.  Before sleep she would knit while I serenaded her with tales from Mu.  It was an awesome way to experience the book (I even used my Oghma voice during the commentary ).                        </div>

<b><i>Let it be known that it is on this day that the second utterance of the Words of Destruction shall commence.</i></b><br/><br/>It's been a while, yes, but scheduling problems have made this a tough one to make happen.<br/><br/><b><i>Let it also be known that the GM is going in without a net.</i></b>  I know where we're at, but I've sort of vigorously failed to do any sort of "prep" thinking for where we're going. <br/><br/>That said, I'm not that worried about it.  I think to some great extent I was developing a natural instinct for "bangs" well before bangs entered my lexicon, and it should not be much of an effort to re-immerse myself in the knowledge/head/mood-space I had for the first session.  <br/><br/>One potential "difficulty" I'm seeing in long-term Dictionary play is that part where some of it revolves on the players contributing dictionary entries.  Even with my requirements being openly stated as "they only need to be 1-3 sentences at most", I've gotten no contributions from any of the four players.  This may be a side-effect of the aforementioned scheduling difficulties, but I think every DoMu GM should be ready to consider what demons <i>might be</i> entered into the Dictionary when the needed player contributions are <i>in absentia</i>.<br/><br/>This next session is also a bit of a make or break one as regards my use of the Sorcerer system.  I'm going to dial back on the detail level a bit -- where I'm tripping up isn't the basics, it's the fiddly details that require reference after reference into the book (like different damage types, times to recover from damage, what that there demon ability is supposed to entail, etc).  This may mean that if I stick with Sorcerer past this session, it'll be in a drifted, "lighter" sort of state where I can do more of what I call "heads-up" (non-book-referencing, on-my-feet) GMing.  I'm going to call for roles and rulings based on instinct rather than reference, which means that I'm going to risk some inconsistency in order to, hopefully, gain the benefit of fluidity.  If Sorcerer still bombs for me, there's a decent chance I'll try for something else, ala <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1727" rel="nofollow">Mu Dogs</a> or <b>Spirit of the Epoch</b> (SOTC+Mu).  Regardless, there's no way I'm turning my back on Mu.<br/><br/>More thoughts in a bit as I make my way through my day.                        </div>

                            Hey, good luck with the "without a net" thing.  I tried that a few times the first time I did Sorcerer, and it didn't work well for me.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I've found that when doing complicated stuff in Sorcerer, it usually pays to slow down the pacing, which will give you more time to find things.                        </div>

Tell me more, sir.  For me 'slow down the pacing' always comes with the suffix '... at the expense of entertainment'.                        </div>

                            Slowing down doesn't have to come at the expense of entertainment.  It's a chance to go all "Iron Heroes" and Jackie Chan in your combat descriptions and add up modifiers, and break things down into smaller chunks for rollover bonuses.  (And while the players do this, you can look stuff up.)  It's like Bringing Down the Pain in SOY: the system demands that you zoom in on this stuff, which means that it has to be very important to the story.  If it's not important to the story, then it's like, "Hey why am I wasting my time?"<br/>
<br/>
In some games, you grind through a lot of mechanics to get a story reward.  In Sorcerer, grinding through the mechanics has to become a reward in itself, through colorful play; otherwise it gets to be a drag.  Fighting and sorcery need to be major, fascinating scenes in their own right, regardless of whatever story outcome hangs in the balance.                        </div>

Ah, I see.  You meant something entirely different when you said "slow things down" than I would've using the same phrase (i.e., I would use that to say "do less in the same period of time" -- which is precisely what I don't wanna do).  Okay, fair enough.  That's still something I feel I need to execute on quickly, however, so my "heads up" problem tends to remain.

                            Fred, the one part of Sorcerer that I find a pain in the neck, administratively, is remembering the currency stuff.  Like, this guy has 3 penalties for temporary things, but 2 lasting penalties, but he gets a +2 rollover bonus, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't done it yet, but my plan is to use physical currency for this (okay, poker chips).  Reds for lasting, white for temps, blues for bonuses (or maybe write 'em on index cards/post its).  You cash in your blues (or hand over the index card) when you redeem your bonus.  Whites go away whenever you need to make your next roll: either as penalties to your defense, or as bonus dice to your attacker.<br/>
<br/>
And use a damage tracker, like this: make circles in a line, equal to character's Stamina x 2, plus a few more.  And then, draw a line between clumps of circles for each multiple of Stamina.  Thus, when the first clump fills up, you've taken penalties equal to your Stamina.  When the second clump fills up, that's Stamina x2.  And everything after that line is major damage.  Whenever you get Red chips (lasting damage), place 'em on the left hand side, and shift the whites over.  (To be really sharp, you could write down the consequences of each threshhold, so the players know and save you a step.)                        </div>

Adapting it to not-Sorcerer is not likely to be very hard.  That said, yes, technically it's a Sorcerer -&gt; Sorcerer &amp; Sword -&gt; Dictionary of Mu supplement.                        </div>

Always happy to pimp the Mu.<br/><br/>Tonight's session rocked in sufficient volume that I may hold off writing about it until tomorrow.<br/><br/>Battlehymn lies in ruins, the Damsel Messiah blind and shattered in the care of her love.  The name of the Slouching Beast has been spoken, and the gods are poised to silence the voice that speaks it.  Mu's Bed fares not much better, though the true extent of its fate remains shrouded behind a wall of smoke.  Elsewhere in the Witchlands, a new betrayal is hatched in the heart of Kor-Elud.<br/><br/>If Marr'd is to survive, it will be only by facing its darkest days.                        </div>

                            WORDS OF DESTRUCTION - SESSION TWO<br/><br/>Some of these writeups will be pretty brief; the game is still being run as a scattered round-robin, with each player having free rein to run off in whatever direction he or she wants.  I want to experience Mu as a sprawl, rather than "party style", so while I expect these guys to cross paths now and again, I'm not sure how much of a team-up we'll see as things go on.<br/><br/>Anyway, the upshot is, some of these individual-player writeups may be pretty brief, but I did my best to make sure everyone got some screen time.  We're doing this as an "open audience" gig, so none of this occurred with just the GM and a player behind a closed door.  I'm finding that a broader scope of OOC knowledge is making the experience of the game's story richer for everyone.<br/><br/>Four other posts to follow, as I get 'em written.                        </div>

                            SOUTH OF ARCADIA<br/><br/>Fayze wakes to find that Brazael is missing.  The Seal, her demon, is raging at her for having slept through Brazael's departure.  "I wasn't finished with her yet!" it hisses.<br/><br/>She starts tracking her friend across the lands, but realizes that as the hard-packed earth near the cave gives way to soft rolling red dunes, she'll lose the tracks in short order.<br/><br/>Consulting her memories of geography, she's clear that there are three places Brazael *could* be going: Olymon, Mu's Bed, or the Mariner's Gash.<br/><br/>Fayze consults the Seal, reaching deep, and wrests the right to ask five questions (unfortunately I only remember a subset of these).  The most important of them are:<br/><br/>*Where might she go?* <br/>The Seal's whisper: Somewhere infertile, and long dead.<br/>(Fayze determines that this likely means not Olymon, the richest mine left in all of Marr'd.)<br/><br/>*How might I catch up with her?*<br/>The Seal's whisper: Some twenty leagues south of here was a great battle.  There fell the mightiest steed ever rode upon the field of battle.  Should you need speed, travel there, and call upon it.<br/>(Fayze dithers on whether or not to do this.)<br/><br/>The other questions lead Fayze to slightly prefer Mu's Bed as her destination. Twenty miles later, she pauses on an ancient field of battle, contemplating whether or not to call the steed.  When the Seal refers to it as Lemur's Mount, she thinks better of it, and continues on.<br/><br/>Days later, she approaches Mu's Bed, exhausted.  But there are pillars of smoke in the distance, and as she nears it, she cannot see the crater that the wretches of Mu's Bed call home for the smoke.<br/><br/>She can, however, see the field of broken and torn bodies she must cross to get there.<br/><br/>Fade to black.                        </div>

                            IN THE OUTER WITCHLANDS OF MU<br/><br/>Kor-Elud wakes in a featureless place, a pathway with high smooth sides and two directions to go. A maze, perhaps.  Distantly, a great thundering noise approaches.  Nearer.  Nearer still.  And in the hazy "sky" overhead, something blots out all light: A giant cube, runes carved upon its surface, bounces, and descends.<br/><br/>Kor-Elud runs as the thing comes crashing behind him, and then continues to roll.  He makes it around a corner, and the giant die rolls past.  Exploring the maze further, he eventually finds he can navigate it cognitively, by relying on his innate and strong sorcerer's gut -- but he's no closer to solving it.  He does, however, find his sister (his demon).  She is bound into some awful metal contraption, trapping her inextricably, bleeding her slowly and leaving her insensate with pain.<br/><br/>Seeing no mechanical, physical means for addressing his sister's predicament, Kor-Elud examines his environs and determines that he is inside a demon.  Most probably Vash-Trun's board-game, as he reflects upon it.<br/><br/>With this in mind, he reaches out with his power and makes contact.  <br/><br/>"Ah, you see me, Sorcerer.  That is well. But dare you take the chance to converse?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I dare."<br/><br/>The great thundering die approaches again.  Kor-Elud does not budge.  It descends.  He regards the monstrosity fearlessly.  And it lands, bone-crackingly, three inches from him and his sister.<br/><br/>"Well done, Sorcerer.  We may talk."<br/><br/>"Where am I?"<br/><br/>"You are within me."<br/><br/>"What are you, then?"<br/><br/>"I am the oldest game ever to be played."<br/><br/>"Who has played you?"<br/><br/>"My full history is lost even to me, but I can tell you that Mu and Lemur sat across from one another to play a game, when I was yet old, but still known to the world."<br/><br/>"How do I escape this?"<br/><br/>"By playing the game."<br/><br/>"I see.  Does Vash-Trun play you now?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes.  My master has played longer than most, but I'm afraid he has as yet to bring his play to a victorious result -- but no defeat, either."<br/><br/>"Where is Vash-Trun?"<br/><br/>"Relax your eyes and gaze above, Sorcerer."<br/><br/>Kor-Elud does so, looking above, and realizes that the vague shapes above are a pair of candles, burning bright, in wall-sconces flanking a giant, looming Vash-Trun.  A few moments later, the giant seems to take a flickering notice of Kor-Elud, but then looks away.  Kor-Elud returns to his conversation with the Game.<br/><br/>"How is the game played?"<br/><br/>"As solitaire, or heads-up."<br/><br/>"What is the objective?"<br/><br/>"Discovering that answer is, indeed, part of the game itself."<br/><br/>"What are the victory conditions?"<br/><br/>"They change, but there is always blood."<br/><br/>Kor-Elud smiles at this.<br/><br/>"Which mode of play is bloodier?"<br/><br/>"While heads-up play may not spill more blood, the blood that flows burns brighter."<br/><br/>"Then I shall play heads-up, with Vash-Trun."<br/><br/>"Most excellent!"<br/><br/>And so Kor-Elud comes back to himself, lying chained upon a bed in Vash-Trun's chambers.  <br/>They converse.  Vash-Trun, impressed with Kor-Elud's abilities, offers a doublecross: he wishes Kor-Elud to join with him and take down Xar-Xaal.  "Xar-Xaal has used the two weeks since we put you in the game to shore up both the secrecy of his dalliance with the Witchbride and his position politic in this province that was to be yours.  I know that Xar-Xaal would turn on me soon enough, much as he has upon you, Kor-Elud.  I have a greater faith that I might convince *you* of my lasting value."  A small smile then, and "The Witch King's sword hungers for us all, sooner or later.  I prefer Xar-Xaal as my armor against that eventuality."<br/><br/>They continue to converse, and plan, and scheme.  Kor-Elud eventually assents, in return for getting his sister (demon) back.  It is a trivial matter for Vash-Trun, who removes a pawn from his board.  Kor-Elud's sister is at the door soon enough.  She shows hints of vast psychological torment and no small amount of insanity: as she drifts into the room, she says, sighing sweetly, "I remember you murdering me, brother."<br/><br/>Kor-Elud says, "Such things happen."<br/><br/>"That's true.  I shall remember it fondly, for what I just went through was a far worse thing."<br/><br/>With that, she curls up into the corner to sleep, and Vash-Trun and Kor-Elud finish hatching their plan to have her impersonate the Witch-King's bride, beloved of Xar-Xaal, and -- with luck -- the means of his undoing.<br/><br/>Fade to black.                        </div>
