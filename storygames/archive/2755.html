A few years back we released "Streetwise," a comedic tongue-in-cheek LARP of Criminal Economics.  We ran the game at Dragoncon from 2001-2004, and had a blast.  We took a break to deal with life issue, and are planning to bring the gam back this year.<br/><br/>What I'm working on now is a complete redesigning of the core mechanics, and not just for Streetwise, but for a series of LARPs we're planning to run (and publish?) in the next couple of years.  I'm still in prototype stage, so it would help to bounce some ideas around and see how they are received.  My thoughts at the moment are pretty jumbled, due to spending all day in a design frenzy, so if I get all stream-of-consciousness on here, just let me know and I'll break down some more clarifications.<br/><br/>There are a few aspects of the system that I'm striving to keep as central to the design process.  First off, I'm trying to keep the core mechanics as math-free as I can.  No character stats, no attributes, no skills, and so on.  The flow of the game is meant to be as close to natural as I can get, and conflicts are handled by what I'm calling the Bid Battle.  In short, Party A says what they way, Party B says what they want, both sides bid why they should succeed, and then a third party (currently called a Mod) decides which happens.  In a convention setting, players are encouraged to flag down random passers-by to act as temporary Mods.<br/><br/>As part of their Bids, players can choose to beef them up by applying one or more of their character's Merits.  Examples include Awesome, Sexy, Strong, Fast, Intuitive, and so on.  For example, here's a paste from my current working notes:<br/><br/>"Each Merit essentially consists of a bonus to the Bid at hand.  When Bidding, you have a mod compare all the Merits that each side is trying to apply to the conflict, and decide whose merits have more credibility. For example, if two combatants are fighting, and the shooter throws in "Pretty" and "Deadly" versus the defender's "Agile" and "Awesome", there's a good chance the defender would out-Merit the attacker and win the conflict, at least within the eyes of the Mod - and that's who counts at that moment."<br/><br/><br/>Thoughts?  I've got a whole lot of assembled notes for this system, and would love to discuss them.

I can see it applying to a whole mess of situations, from arguements and combat to deal-making and strategizing.  Preferrably, players can resole these disagreements on their own, through negotiation and role-playing.  When that fails, they can agree to resolve it via a bid battle.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Cool. Nice stuff. Here's lots of questions.<br/><br/>I think you need some guidance for the Mod. Do I take the suggestion that's most likely to happen? Or most exciting? Or the one I personally like best? And, if there are Merits involved, how much weight do I give to them? If Player A is using two Merits and Player B is using none, but I prefer Player B's bid, can I go with that?<br/></blockquote>\nI'm working on an idea for a quick "How to Mod" spiel players can tell to passers-by they flag down.  As far as the rules are being written, I'm assuming that the Mods will usually default to personal preference.  How they decide is ultimately up to them, and the players have a lot of freedom to try to convince them.<br/><br/>In the core system, the main focus is on applying your Merits to the Bid, and basically upping your chances of being judged as the winner.  There are limits to the frequency of use of your Merits, and how they can be applied, but in the end, it's all about how you describe why you should win.  In other games, however, it could get more entertaining.  For example, when applying this system to the tongue-in-cheeck Streetwise setting, the bids are not based on the Merits, but instead on what they can offer the Mod.  "I'll give you five bucks" versus "I'll show you my boobs", for example, are perfectly acceptable bids for that rather adult-oriented game.  In this incarnation, Merits would be used to force the other player to re-bid, or some such mechanic.<br/><br/>But in the end, the decision is one of the Mods own personal preference, similar to that used by the card game Apples to Apples.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite><br/>Are there any limits to what can happen? Can I kill another player character?<br/></blockquote>\nYes, depending on the game at hand.  One of the tenets of the original Streetwise LARP system was that you could kill anyone, but they'd be back in 30 minutes or after being revived by the Militant Baptist Church - after all, you cap one punk on the streets, another just takes his place.  We wanted paying players to be able to enjoy the game as long as they liked, and not have their fun ruined because some trigger-happy player killed them off.  It led to a lot of crazy-fun scenes, most definitely.<br/><br/>In this new system, the nature of death and such are ultimately left to the game.  For example, in two of the urban streets-focused LARPs we're planning to run, we plan on combat being a bigger feature of the game, so for those we're using the Combat system extension I'm designing.  This system adds an expendable number of Lives to each character (starts at 9), and a way for weapon to quickly eliminate those lives if used as part of a Bid Battle.  Of course, we've also made it possible for medic-types to restore Lives, and for players to buy more at the main desk.<br/><br/>For other games with less of a focus on players killing each other, I can see the combat extension working okay, but it might be more exciting and dramatic for a death to only happen when dramatically appropriate.  In such cases, I would guess that the Arbiters of the game would make a special call on death being off-limits unless the other player agreed.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite><br/>Can another player be a Mod?<br/></blockquote>\nAbsolutely.  In a small non-convention setting, this would be practically necessary.  Players and Arbiters alike can be mods, and of course fairness is encouraged, but not enforced.  Players should keep in mind that at some point, the players they are "unfairly" ruling against could in turn be in a position to do the same to them.<br/><br/>This is the same for con settings, although we greatly encourage players to flag down random passers-by.  They can make decisions based on ignorance of the system, and it serves as instant free advertising for the group running the game.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Are Merits constant?I think you could do some pretty neat things if you allow them to be variable; then, maybe, it means something different for a character to be pretty or Pretty, and Merit changes can be part of the results of conflicts somehow.</blockquote>\nThis is a really awesome idea.  I have been writing a system extension for how to use it in long-term "campaign" play, with advancement and the like.  I think giving Merits the innate option to change after some conflicts would be really interesting.  Maybe a way to add enhancing adjectives, such as "Really" pretty, or "Irresistably" pretty.<br/><br/>I like!

An "Action Bubble" is established, and then the actions are resolved in sequence.  There isn't any specific "initiative" attribute, so determining the order is mainly a matter of convenience.  If an Arbiter isn't present, then someone involved should take the temporary responsibility of moving things along.  If it's combat, then I've decided to break each "round" into a few phases: non-combat, ranged, melee, and escape.  Each phase, resolve the conflicts of that phase, and then apply the results all at once before moving to the next phase.  People with applicable Merits (such as Quick, Sprig-Heeled, etc) can possibly petition the Arbiter to go first.<br/><br/>I don't see this system working well with a group of individuals, as much as with a collective.  I'm sure folks who are only playing for character glory will easily find ways to break the system.  I'm considering this, and I'm not sure whether I want to put systems in place to help minimize it, or to instead just acknowledge it and move on.<br/><br/>And you're dead on about the passers-by.  I think the choice of who to grab is ultimately up to those involved.  If they feel their conflict is exceptionally complicated, then I'd hope they would find an Arbiter, or even another player.<br/><br/>But then again, explaining that situation you presented to a complete stranger at a con has potential to be a <i>lot</i> of fun, too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
