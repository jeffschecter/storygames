It's my first run as MC.<br/><br/>The session was great, but now it's time to make fronts, and I have an issue. Even though the players didn't hold back on me, and we generated lots of cool locations and NPCs, I don't think I have enough to firm up my fronts without creating new locations / NPCs / fictionally significant stuff on my own.<br/><br/>I'm wondering: how much do you other MCs create on your own between the first session and the second session? My inclination is not to add much new on my own, focusing on what the group creates together. My gut tells me that I should write up what I have, then treat the second session like an extension of the first, asking lots of provocative questions that will fill in some of the gaps so that by the time *that* session is over, I'll be able to finish up the fronts. However, the Front section of the book seems to imply that straight up creating new characters and whole new chunks of the world is allowed or even standard when you make threats for a Front.<br/><br/>So: what I want to know is, what do you do when you create a Front? What's the process look like, especially in regards to using player generated material and inserting your own creations into the fiction?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384637/#Comment_384637" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T18:18:18+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  6:18PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you listed their resources right?

I haven't had a problem getting players to come up with interesting answers about where they get their "meat", who controls the gun trade, etc.<br/><br/>My question was: how do people go about creating their Threats and Fronts. Specifically, when you're figuring out who is bent on taking the above things away from the PCs, do you hold yourself to using just characters/places/aspects of the world your players already generated for you, do you go wild making up new characters/places/aspects of the world, or somewhere in between?<br/><br/>Johnstone and Valamir don't directly address that question, since that's not what the OP asked for, but it seems like what they're describing leans towards the make shit up on your own end of the spectrum, if I'm reading them right.\n<blockquote>Don't be afraid to add new stuff on your own. It's fine that you would like to generate most of the details as a group, but as MC you need to fill in details too. </blockquote>\nCool. That's as direct an answer as I could have asked for. So, is there any particular approach you have to this, when you put together your threats and Fronts? Do you use player generated stuff as a springboard for making threats on your own? Do you use player generated material, making up things just to fill in gaps? I'd love to see someone write out their thought process on a single actual Front they created.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384644/#Comment_384644" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T18:57:34+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  6:57PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so on that side of things. What I do is look at all the stuff that got generated and find places to make problems for the characters. <br/><br/>Like Trevis said, look for resources that other people might want to steal, and make up those other people. Look at stuff that suggests mysteries and work out what's going on there. If anyone has a gang or a crew, work out all the details about those people, and their families, and their friends, and how they fit into the other things that are going on.<br/><br/>Also, I like to draw a map of everything. Then, when all the first session stuff is on the map, fill in all the gaps with other bits and pieces. Mostly I don't do any more than name them at this stage (they provide good fodder for questions in later sessions, e.g. "Okay, so you've scavenging for old time stuff - tell me which of these spots is your best bet.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384647/#Comment_384647" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T19:46:21+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  7:46PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2012 7:51PM by robb.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that you need to feel free to make stuff up - the MC owns the world, the players can only really answer questions based on what their characters already know. (or at least that is my impression of what most people say)<br/><br/>Hence my front creation process is something like: (Edit:OTOH this is _very_ close to the book so maybe its Baker's not mine. Always read the instructions.)<br/>1. find cool location/NPC/condition the players mentioned<br/>2. assign it to some threat type, preferably one that is not already strongly represented in the game-world eg there is less variety of every warlord is a Slaver (although that could be cool too!)<br/>3. assign the cool item to some fundamental scarcity for a thematic link for the front<br/>4. look through the other stuff the players created to see if there is another something/one/place that is related/fits the theme (don't worry if not), if so assign them to threat types + fill in<br/>5. think of related threats - does the warlord need a gang? is the landscape they inhabit a threat too? what delusion or custom is he spreading/causing?<br/>6. think of the dark future created by the PCs not acting on the threat. Write this down.<br/>7. Re-visit 2-6 to see if they still gel together/make sense + change what doesn't<br/>8. Write some stakes questions - easiest is "will NPC X succeed?", "will dark future Y come true for NPC Z?". Edit: more specific questions will come to you now or later as you think about the front<br/>9. Re-visit 2-8 to see if they still gel together/make sense + change what doesn't<br/>10.

It's the same reason why in the First Session you are writing down things you yourself 'wonder' about -- because finding out those answers are part of what is going to make the game rewarding for you.<br/><br/>So while you definitely are going to have some Threats and Fronts that are already jumping out at you as possibilities from that first session, I think it's a good idea to just read through the lists of Threats and figure out which ones sound really cool to you, or spark ideas <i>in the context of what's already in the world</i>. But if you think a Landscape threat sounds totally neat, or a Grotesque, or a Warlord or whatever, this is where you get to put that in the world -- not so it can be your special protected thing, but so you can see how the PCs interact with it, and see what they make of it and what they do about it.<br/><br/>So yeah, just remember that the first session is exceptional, because the players provide so much of the initial content. But once the game gets going, you're not there to just mirror the players' apocalypse back at them -- your job is to bring your own apocalypse to the table, and bring it hard, and smash it into the fragile framework of the PC's lives. And you're only going to be able to do that if you make the Fronts and Threats that make you go 'huh -- I wonder what's going to happen with <i>that?</i>'<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384703/#Comment_384703" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T11:31:12+00:00" title="July 10, 2012 11:31AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading the last few posts makes me want to play AW really bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384709/#Comment_384709" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T11:41:48+00:00" title="July 10, 2012 11:41AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384729/#Comment_384729" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T13:06:02+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  1:06PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two games of AW I have played were both set around real places, one around Hoover Dam and another in the Hudson River Valley.

I wrote about adapting threat countdowns for the Swedish horror rpg Kult. You might find some of that advice useful. Part 1 is <a href="http://www.kult-rpg.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=4906&amp;title=Reading+Kult+11%3A+The+Gamemaster\\%26%23039%3Bs+Function+Part+1" rel="nofollow">here</a> and part 2 is <a href="http://www.kult-rpg.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=4912&amp;title=Reading+Kult+12%3A+The+Gamemaster\\%26%23039%3Bs+Function+Part+2" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You might need to skip my comments about the Kult rulebook, though.<br/><br/>I'm pretty lazy about writing up proper fronts myself. I just pick a problem and write a countdown that will eventually lead to everybody dying or something similar if the PCs don't do anything about it. Sometimes I just think about how a problem should get worse and then decide which NPC or NPCs would best express that in the present moment and frame a scene. If I want to introduce new stuff, I do that whenever it's appropriate.<br/><br/>You should keep doing all the 1st session stuff after the first session, that's what the book tells you. The difference is that you can do your own prep in between sessions, and create fronts full of the stuff you want to introduce.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
