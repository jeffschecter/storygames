                    Many apologies if you've seen this <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21895.0" rel="nofollow">over at the Forge</a>, but I wanted to give this a try over here.<br/><br/>I'm looking, increasingly desperately, for a cartoon of a running rabbit. There's <a href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=4468745&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=running%20rabbit&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=18&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=" rel="nofollow">one I <i>could</i> use</a> at Clipart.com, but it's not quite right. And I'd rather give the money to an artist, if there's one who's willing. I can't pay <i>that</i> much, but I can pay something.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be new: it can be an old cartoon and I'll pay a bit of money for the licensing rights. And it doesn't have to be complex: a quick line drawing would do fine. But the website's just not looking right without this cartoon. <br/><br/>Any help is much appreciated.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>
