I have a playtest during DexCon and I'm getting the text cleaned up.  <br/><br/>SPIRAL is a game designed to tell tales of Lovecraftian Horror, games ABOUT dying and going insane.  It's all about the reveal and about the players controlling the most fun part of the process - how their character die or go insane.  More on the mechanics later.  <br/><br/>You may hear a lot from me in the next month. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So I have two kinds of players, those that control the characters and those that control the antagonists.  The antagonists are called horrors and the players that control the horrors are called cultists.  Initially I had the alternate role being victims and they control the protagonists in the story.  I am VERY happy with cultist and horror.  I am very happy with victim.  I just feel like I should have a set of words to differentiate between player and character.  I don't want to use the words "player," "character," or "protagonist." And the characters certainly are not heroes or any of the like.  Victim works well for both player and character but I'd need a alternate word whichever gets chosen.<br/><br/>Please help with suggestions for evocative names for either player role or character.<br/><br/>Thanks for your input,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
