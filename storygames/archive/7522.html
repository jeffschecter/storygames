That seems a long time ago. I played various things, on and off, for about ten years, then returned to my preferred miniatures games. I think the last time I did a role-playing game  was about ten years ago when I ran a couple of 'Timelord' scenarios for my wife.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago my son, 13, went to stay with my brother, who does far more roleplaying than I. He took my son to his regular Monday night session, and they played 3:16. My son loved it. So I acquired a copy and, last night, had a go at running it. The players were my family: my son (13), my daughter (nearly 12) and my wife (age: classified). My daughter had never role-played before. Needless to say that she ended up as the squad's sergeant. <br/><br/>We did one mission, just so that we could all get used to the game. The squad were sucked into attempts by the planet's dog-man inhabitants to rescue some prisoners before they were interrogated. They fought off an attempt to rescue them from a forward supply base, again when the prisoners were being transferred to a command base but failed to prevent a bold raid on the command base itself and lost them. However tracking them down they found the enemy base and wasted it in a final, climactic fight. For each encounter in which they retained the prisoners they got +1 Dominance for the final encounter, representing the increased intelligence interrogation brought.<br/><br/>Characters were Sergeant Bond (my daughter), who only seemed interested in tracking down her next meal, Corporal Bonzo (my wife), whose main interest was split between killing dogs and undermining Bond, and Trooper O'Toole (my son) who just kept his head down and killed things.<br/><br/>Here's the squad:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/2825372485/" rel="nofollow" title="Soldiers Of The 3:16 by Kaptain Kobold, on Flickr"><img alt="Soldiers Of The 3:16" height="240" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3020/2825372485_c7a6c80cca_m.jpg" width="180"/></a><br/><br/>And here's me, setting the scene for one of the encounters:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/2826152702/" rel="nofollow" title="03/09/2008 (Day 2.247) - 3:16 by Kaptain Kobold, on Flickr"><img alt="03/09/2008 (Day 2.247) - 3:16" height="210" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3211/2826152702_3bf57a2db2_m.jpg" width="240"/></a><br/><br/>O'Toole got the medal for killing the last threat, blowing up an enemy flame-cannon to destroy the dog base. Bonzo got the most kills (E-cannon, of course) and revealed past skills as a sure-footed acrobat, whilst Bond escaped court-martial for running away in the last fight due to insufficient evidence. It turned out that she was afraid of fire.<br/><br/>Conclusion? We all loved it; a fun game indeed. I'm sure a lot of the subtleties passed us by, but we worked out how to play it, and I think the next session will yield more interesting results. My wife has aleady worked out that were my daughter's character to have a little 'accident' on the battlefield, then she would be promoted to Sergeant but would still get to keep her E-Cannon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166943/#Comment_166943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T07:51:33+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  7:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is fantastic!<br/><br/>That you would play an RPG again after all that time and have fun, as a family.

Family favourites are Fluxx, Carcasonne and Before You Die, Mr Bond. I do a lot of miniature wargaming as well - a mixture of fantasy and historical.<br/><br/>3:16 was an unusual game, because the mechanisms are sketchy compared to, say, Champions, which I used to play a lot years ago (when it was first releassed, in fact). A game heavily geared towards storytelling was something new for me to try, and I enjoyed it. My wife is good with stories, which helps; she did a lot to drive the characters along, and keep the children moving, whilst I was able to concentrate on mechanisms.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope to give it another go later this week. And we've got a long holiday coming up in a few weeks which should give some opportunity for play as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
