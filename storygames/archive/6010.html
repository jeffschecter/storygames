It's now close to completion, for the 5th and last time. It's going into alpha or beta playtest, probably next week. <br/>(Which is it? Alpha or beta? I need people to play it when I'm not there.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I need to figure out my elevator pitch. So, let me tell you a bit about it. Perhaps you can help.<br/><br/>It does for film &amp; literature what PTA did for TV sitcoms. <br/>It's GMless, the roll is divided up amongst several players.<br/>Players frame scenes around their own protagonist.<br/>It produces emergent play, in that the protagonists, the setting, and the story are created through play. At the beginning of the game you just have 3 setting details and your protagonists name and role (each player gets a protagonist).<br/>It uses the Hero's Journey and the 5 act Structure/Play as a tool for character and scene development.<br/><br/>Those are the basics. I'm not sure how to bill this thing.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.unWrittenContinuum.com" rel="nofollow">unWritten Continuum, my blog about the game.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134520/#Comment_134520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T01:35:10+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  1:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 1:38AM by Graham.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like all you need to me.

I feel like what your talking about is the emergent quality of the game, that element which reinforces the story that all of the people are striving for within the game.

In particular, as soon as I hear the words 'Hero's Journey' and 'myth' my brain turns off -- it's too late to bring in film &amp; literature, because I already think this is yet another game about mythy mythy myth and tedious Campbellisms. It basically takes the last item on the list (actually only half of it) and blows it up into the entirety of the game.<br/><br/>No amount of saying 'film' and 'literature' after that point will get me back, because those two concepts seem quite overshadowed by the whole myth thing. Whereas the idea that this is a game meant to do 'film' and 'literature' is, by itself, incredibly appealing to me.<br/><br/>Now it may be that your game is actually much closer to what Paul wrote than what I think of when I hear 'film and literature'. But when I hear those words I think about the French New Wave and Modernist novels, and that appeals to me. When I hear 'Hero's Journey' and 'myth' I just imagine yet another fantasy game with vague thematic pretentions. Paul's pitch says to me: "All our stories are basically the same thing underneath, and that's why we like them -- so why not make even more of the same story, using this game!" (Yes, I realize that is a terribly uncharitable reading.) Absolutely not the sort of pitch that makes me think this game will produce the sort of film or literature I'd want to see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134764/#Comment_134764" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T23:28:32+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 11:28PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 11:28PM by AnttiKi.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm not the right person to answer, but as I have the time, here goes)<br/>\n<br/>\nIce Cream Emperor: I don't think that the Hero's Journey or five-act structure can give you New Wave or modernist novels, sorry.

I happen to be one who started in the love it camp, thinking it was this incredible thing, but now I've come to an understanding that it is really this vague interpretation of story in the guise of specific examples and expectations. Thus, from learning it one would think that it can only do Star Wars or similar types of stories. In fact, it allows for so much more because it's a bunch of really basic concepts. For example, you have one or more protagonists, there is conflict, there is something that is not what it seems to be, there is a cause to the conflict, etc. I just described 3 main components to the hero's journey: The Hero, The Refusal, The Shapeshifer, and The Shadow, etc. I wish I could have come up with some better examples, but it's late.<br><br>That said, I think you will find that, despite the hero's journey, you will be able to produce stories that you both (Daniel and Antti) would appreciate.<br><br>I, also, have my doubts about mentioning the hero's journey in the pitch (now more then before). Paul created a great line and I ran with that.<br/><br/>"unWritten is a game that takes traditional story structures and embeds them into the mechanics. Through its play a story emerges for the players as it would for the audience of film and literature. In the end you will have produced a thematically engaging story set in your favorite genre."<br/><br/>So, yes, it uses the hero's journey, but not as a strict framework.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with New Wave or modernist novels. can you please refer some to me.<br/><br/>Thanks Alex                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134775/#Comment_134775" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T02:38:08+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  2:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just looked up Modernist Literature in wikipedia. Most of what I saw listed I recognized as poetry, the rest was some elaboration of poetry. So, no, unWritten does not do poetry. However, I saw Kafka in there. I've read Metamorphosis, but a long time ago. I think you could do something like that with unWritten, but I'll reread it to be sure.<br/><br/>What is it that Modernist Literature does that other "types" does not do? I'll be playtesting it further this weekend, it would be cool to see if I can break my own game. So, please let me know what it is that you don't think it can do because of its connection to the hero's journey...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134777/#Comment_134777" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T02:47:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  2:47AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 2:56AM by alejandro.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Final note on the unWritten, before I stop typing for the night.

It wasn't a heroic journey in the least and we didn't get close to finishing the game. But!

Modernist Novels:<br/><i>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</i> by T.S. Eliot. <br/>T.S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land </i><br/>Virginia Woolf's <i>Kew Gardens</i> and <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>, <br/>James Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> and <i>Ulysses</i>, <br/>Katherine Porter's <i>Flowering Judas</i> <br/>Jean Toomer's <i>Cane</i>, <br/>William Faulkner's <i>The Sound and the Fury</i>.<br/>Ernest Hemingway's <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: alejandro</cite>What is it that Modernist Literature does that other "types" does not do?</blockquote>\nI got this from the wiki: <br/><br/>Modernist literature is defined by its move away from Romanticism, venturing into subject matter that is traditionally mundane. Modernist literature often features a marked pessimism, a clear rejection of the optimism apparent in Victorian literature. In fact, "a common motif in Modernist fiction is that of an alienated individual--a dysfunctional individual trying in vain to make sense of a predominantly urban and fragmented society". <i>However, many Modernist works like T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land are marked by the absence of a central, heroic figure</i>; in rejecting the solipsism of Romantics like Shelley and Byron, these works reject the subject of Cartesian dualism and collapse narrative and narrator into a collection of disjointed fragments and overlapping voices. Modernist literature transcends the limitations of the Realist novel with its concern for larger factors such as social or historical change; Modernism as a literary movement is seen, in large part, as a reaction to the emergence of city life as a central force in society.<br/><br/>The French New Wave is a film thing. Also from wiki:<br/><br/>Although never a formally organized movement, the New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful iconoclasm. Many also engaged in their work with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style, and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm.<br/><br/>The movement has its roots in rebellion against the reliance on past forms (often adapted from traditional novellic structures), criticizing in particular the way these forms could force the audience to submit to a dictatorial plot-line. New Wave critics and directors studied the work of these and other classics. They did not reject them, but rather found a new outlet for the same creative energies. The low-budget approach helped film-makers get at the essential art form and find what, to them, was a much more comfortable and honest form of production. Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Howard Hawks, John Ford, and many other forward-thinking film directors were held up in admiration while standard Hollywood films bound by traditional narrative flow were strongly criticized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135084/#Comment_135084" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T05:00:00+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  5:00AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks James and Carl, I also read that wikipedia entry after I posted my emails. After having considered ML, I feel like unWritten could manage it with little changes to the rules, very little. I can't guarantee that, having not yet playtested it. There are five things I think cover ML: Bizarre, Mundane, Pessimistic, Allegorical and Freeform. The last two aren't necessary of all ML, but they should still be considered... I'll have my new playtests up by the end of next week, I'd ask those of you that have posted to playtest unWritten and tell me how it works for you. Try to create any type of story you want, even non hero's journey stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136083/#Comment_136083" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T01:28:23+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  1:28AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I attempted to explore Modernist Literature in my previous game... but my group nixed it.
