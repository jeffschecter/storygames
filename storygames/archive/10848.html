The idea is that you pick a culture/area being shifted by politics, power, war, magic, whatever and here are these people with the power to change out that comes out.<br/><br/>Heroquest 1 backs out from that a bit.  The advice is kinda there, and mixed with advice on how to run a more traditional "GM creates the story, players 'go through' it" kind of affair.  All of the sample scenarios are designed for the latter style of play.<br/><br/>Heroquest 2 takes a different tack in the latter - the GM may not prepare the whole story in advance, but the rules are designed to try to emulate climax points, around which the GM improvises.  It's also the most complex in terms of intersecting rules interacting- the GM typically has several, several options in terms of how to run a single conflict, and how hard to set consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240604/#Comment_240604" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T10:24:58+00:00" title="November  5, 2009 10:24AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2009 10:25AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/neil">@neil</a>: ok, cool. Edges seemed a bit, I dunno, much. Kind of like "we already have these other things to think about; do we NEED edges?" <br/>*looks up Edges* Yeah, permanent or recurring Edges and Handicaps make sense, but you have to read the basic definition a couple of times lest you think there's some kind of "spontaneous" Edge to worry about too. \n<blockquote><br/>(p.135) "An edge is a number that is added to AP staked when the character's opponent must transfer or forfeit AP."</blockquote>\nMaybe I'm weird, but that initially sounded like edges were "created" by such a loss of AP. But I guess that's just saying how they interact with AP loss. Anyway. Thanks for the tables and the rules summary therein (thereat?) - they'll prove useful ^_^<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/bankuei">@bankuei</a>: it sounds like I got the version that I'd be happiest with, then, thematically. Hero Wars has some very cool (and surprisingly related to stuff I learned at the Forge) story-game advice in the Narrator's Book - it tells players to drop "I try to..." when describing actions in favor of making clear statements, it derides Fortune-at-the-Beginning as causing dull and listless play, and throughout the rules advice, it reminds the Narrator to make choices based on the needs of the story, trumping things like sound tactical responses and logical accuracy. It doesn't advocate fudging dice anywhere either, which is something older games suggested when they claimed to be "about the story". No Rule Zero here! ^_^<br/><br/>It's pretty amazing to think that this came out around the same time as the Pool and the Window and other simple-system, "rules should be seen and not heard" design styles. It's got some crunch, but not a lot, and it's pretty firmly Story Now in what it's encouraging the group to do. You could play a Hero Wars game that centers on just discovering parts of Glorantha and all that, but that would require very careful choice of Occupation and Magic keywords, otherwise the Narrator would still have a bushel full of things he could do to keep the plot more coherent and shapely. "Yeah, the guard at the gate has the rune of Urvairinus tattooed on his neck, and when you hand him your travel papers, he sees your matching rune on the back of your hand. He begs for your help!"<br/>Cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240615/#Comment_240615" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T11:47:07+00:00" title="November  5, 2009 11:47AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2009 8:36PM by Valamir.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hero Wars was a great game...had some mechanical flaws and quirks but its soul was in the right place.<br/>\n<br/>\nHero Quest is what we got when people who didn't understand what made Hero Wars a great game tried to fix its flaws and quirks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240617/#Comment_240617" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T12:52:56+00:00" title="November  5, 2009 12:52PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Zac,<br><br>The only suggestion, I might offer, then, is to think after some play if you want to change how Edges work.

My only quibble is how <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">some</span> a few things are worded, but the basic ideas look solid. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/bankuei">@bankuei</a>: I will definitely consider Edges. It's weird to me that they don't capitalize the word "Edge" in the rulebook, btw.<br/>Anyway, I totally get what you mean about them being a big deal, but I think something I'd like to do is let temporary or one-shot Edges/Handicaps be a big deal. I think I read something in there about those... basically, if an exchange in an Extended Contest lets me push my opponent up against a wall, I think I should get an Edge (or give him a Handicap) because I've cornered him, until that's no longer the case. That adds to the equipment and other things, too, right? I'm pretty sure multiple Edges are allowed, provided they're from different "sources". *consults rulebook* Ok, nothing clearly points out what to do.<br/>One neat thing it does say, though, is that Edges are added to the total wager BEFORE a multiplier is applied, which would really, really make a big difference ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240857/#Comment_240857" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T21:35:16+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  9:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hero Wars is probably a better text for teaching you the game.

They only include the cultures listed in the basic rules, but still ... the Lunars have a LOT of gods and great-god aspects and so on.
