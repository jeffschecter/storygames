Right now, I'm working on a "cost matrix" where traits are costed based on the magnitude of the effect and the frequency it is likely to appear in play. The thing I <i>don't</i> like about the EZ20 system is that it doesn't allow for gradations of, e.g., dexterity. And, yes, I intend to use a lot of examples and more quantitative guidelines for frequency and magnitude. So, for example, something that is likely to appear in play once per encounter costs two steps higher than one that is likely to appear once per campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70291/#Comment_70291" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T13:30:52+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  1:30PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just make it cost more the more you use it.

Can be spent immediately or saved to spend later. Tokens can be spent for cumulative +1s (+1 per token) before a roll.<br/><br/>Levels: No levels, just increases to traits. Broad traits start at +2, narrow at +4. These increase with experience by +2 each time (regardless of broad or narrow).<br/><br/>Experience: Group votes, based on character activity and behavior, on character trait increase/decrease/new trait at end of every session. Additionally, player chooses character trait increase/decrease/new trait at end of every story arc (one or more sessions).<br/><br/>NPCs: No NPC mechanics, just DCs to roll against (15 being default -- see Difficulty Chart below) and a number of health boxes to knock off (1-3). Hitting the DC knocks a box off the NPC; failing the DC knocks a box off the PC.<br/><br/>Rolls: Simple and extended conflict rolls, not task rolls.<br/><br/>Crits: Automatic successes and failures -- natural 20 and natural 1 -- cause double damage (i.e., two knocked-off boxes, to NPC or PC, respectively) on a successful second roll. If the second roll is also a natural 20 or natural 1, reroll a third time to check for triple damage (i.e., all boxes knocked off -- meaning automatic success/failure in the overall conflict or assign a temporary consequence). If the third roll is also a natural 20 or natural 1, reroll a fourth time to check for quadruple damage (i.e., all boxes knocked off and automatic success/failure in the overall conflict or assign a permanent consequence). If, somehow, the fourth roll is also a natural 20 or natural 1, reroll a fifth time to check for quintessential damage (i.e., all boxes knocked off and automatic success/failure in the overall conflict or the end of the NPC/PC).<br/><br/>Health boxes: Only 3, and not of different varieties. (Use tokens.) Once the third is knocked off, the conflict is won or lost -- unless the character, whether NPC or PC, takes a consequence. Can continue doing this -- taking a consequence in place of losing by further hits -- up to a permanent consequence, after which the third and final consequence will be the end of the character, such as "Dead" or "Permanent Vegetable" or "Joins a nunnery" or "Joins the Dark Side" or "Retires to the country" or whatever. However, the player does get that *last* roll to try to win the conflict -- the cost for the attempt will simply be the end of the character, in whatever fashion. The character can, of course, give/yield at any time before this. Health boxes refresh at the end of every conflict.<br/><br/>Consequence: GM adds 2 to a trait or subtracts 2 from a trait, or creates a new trait at +2 or +4 (broad or narrow) or -2 or -4 (broad or narrow). Sometimes, a consequence can even be *useful* to a character! Such as "Stubborn" or "Doesn't give up." The first consequence in a conflict is temporary (between scene and session-length), the second consequence in a conflict is permanent (or until taken away with experience or a later consequence), and the third and final consequence in a conflict removes a character from the game.<br/><br/>Difficulty Chart:<br/>Easy - 5<br/>Average - 10<br/>Challenging - 15<br/>Difficult - 20<br/>Very Difficult - 25<br/>Overwhelming - 30<br/>Impossible - 35+                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70562/#Comment_70562" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T21:14:58+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  9:14PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2007 9:15PM by jdrakeh.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, this thread prompted me to do something that I've been promising to do since 2004. . . . the new site can be accessed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://miscellaneousdebris.sitesled.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></span>.

Here's my little tweak to the traits:<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/><b>Creating Characters</b><br/>Writers often get a little kernel of advice: "Show, don't tell." That is, if a character is happy, don't just say "Bill is happy guy." Yes, it's a pretty clear sentence, but it doesn't give any sense of Bill's character. More importantly, it doesn't provide any useful cues to you or the rest of the group about what Bill can be expected to do in the game. The following revised steps are an attempt to create an action-oriented, "show, don't tell" style of characters in EZ20.<br/><br/><b>1. Visualize Action</b><br/>The first step in creating a character is imagining them. It's easy to think of a character standing calmly, waiting for their portrait to be painted. But, unless your game is focused on portraiture, this visualization isn't very helpful in communicating what your character will actually be doing in the game.<br/><br/>Instead, imagine your character in the thick of their chosen profession, challenging their skills in an epic test. Imagine the climax of the movie where this character is the star. Imagine what <i>you most often want to do in the game.</i><br/><br/>Jot down some notes about what you're imagining as future reference for yourself and for the rest of the group. Adjectives are fine, but try to avoid them. Remember, your character's personality is expressed through his actions.<br/><br/><b>2. Choose Four Traits</b><br/>Traits are descriptive words that are used to define your character concept by determining what your character will be good at doing during actual play. To this end, a given trait grants a die roll bonus to a player whenever their character performs an action feasibly linked to said trait. There are two different types of traits used in EZ20 \xe2\u20ac\u201c <b>verbs</b> and <b>adverbs</b>. In case it's been a while since you've taken an English class, here's a quick refresher:<br/><br/><b>Verbs</b> are things you do. These include words like stealing, fighting, or singing. If your verb requires the presence of a noun, like spell-casting, that's fine. (It can't hurt to pull out the trusty old thesaurus, though.) Verbs are narrow traits with a somewhat tight focus, encompassing only one action. For instance, the verb fishmongering can only feasibly be linked to actions that involve. . . er. . . fishmongering. While narrow traits are not, by nature, as widely applicable as adverbs, they make up for their narrow scope by granting a relatively large die roll bonus when a player calls upon them during actual play. Lastly, if your verb requires the use of a piece of equipment, note it along with that verb.<br/><br/><b>Adverbs</b> describe how you do things. In English, these are often words that end in -ly, such as mercifully, helpfully, drunkenly, honorably, and maliciously. If you can't find quite the adverb you need, you can use a phrase conjoined with the word "with." For example, you can say "with vigor" instead of "vigorously." (I must admit, I'm having trouble thinking of words that couldn't be easily converted to an adverb, but I'm sure they're out there.) Adverbs encompass a wide variety of possible actions by virtue of their scope. For instance, the trait Dextrously can feasibly be linked to all actions that require a degree of agility or hand-to-eye coordination, from slight of hand tricks to sword dueling. Adverbs allow a character to cover a lot of ground but due to the lack of focus associated with such traits, they grant players a relatively small die roll bonus.<br/><br/>At this time, you need to choose four traits that describe what you most want to do in the game (and what the rest of the group can expect you to do.)<br/>It should be made clear that adverbs are NOT tied to any particular verbs you've chosen. Adverbs are simply the ways you best perform <i>any</i> action. By the same token, verbs are NOT the only actions you can take, they're the ones you're best at doing. <br/><br/>Let's say you visualize your character as "an elven huntress slaying foes with a barrage of arrows from her magical bow and communing with spirits of the dead." Let's break this down into the possible verbs and adverbs you can pull from this description.<br/><br/><i>"elven"</i><br/>The fact that your character is an elf is irrelevant unless it is an important part of what she actually <i>does</i>. If you want your character to be an elf, but don't choose any verbs or adverbs linked to that heritage, then it's okay to just play a regular human. If you <i>do</i> want to play up the elven angle, then imagine what elves <i>do</i> that are clearly demonstrative of their nature. Elves are usually described as being aloof adherents to ancient ways, so you could have adverbs like Callously, Stubbornly, or Pedantically. Elves are also often described as being pretty much masters of any skill, but some typical elven verbs include Casting Spells, Public Speaking, Seducing, or Shooting with a Bow and Arrow.<br/><br/><i>"slaying foes with a barrage of arrows from her magical bow"</i><br/>Ah, now this is the real meat of the description. The verbs are right there in black and white: "Slaying" and/or "Shooting with a Magical Bow." There are also a few adverbs here: "Dextrously," "Rapidly," and/or "Magically."<br/><br/><i>"communing with spirits of the dead"</i><br/>Another great example of clearly expressed verbs. It might be tempting to simply encompass this behavior in a profession's name, like Medium or Spiritualist, but people have very different ideas about what a spiritualist <i>does</i>. Anything ranging from a sideshow charlatan to an ancient witch doctor can come to mind. This is why it's we're sticking to the verbs and adverbs rather than relying on the generalities of "Classes." Verbs that can be pulled from this part of the description include "Summoning the Spirits of the Dead," "Hearing/Seeing/Smelling the Spirits of the Dead," "Performing rituals," "Dancing," or "Meditating." Adverbs associated with spiritualists might be "Reverently," "By Candlelight," "Frighteningly," or "Dramatically."<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>Yeah, it's mostly semantics, but it might provide more structure for those of us (myself included) who need some more structure in character creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93964/#Comment_93964" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T04:13:38+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  4:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2007 4:15AM by jdrakeh.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back from the dead! Whee! <br/><br/>I'm going to try to finish up the layout for the printed ashcan edition of EZ20 this weekend. The main change is that I've dropped 'blows' in favor of hit points. I know, I know -- it's a step away from conflict resolution but it's a step toward: <br/><br/>A. A larger degree of compatibility with existing (and possibly <i>future</i>) d20/OGL products. <br/>B. A rule set more accessible to hobby newcomers. <br/><br/>That said, I've retained tracking for physical and psychological damage. Social damage was an unfortunate casualty of tightening up design in regard to the two goals above, though I don't think the system is noticeably weaker for it (a bit less 'social' perhaps, though that's something that I'm not 100% certain one needs mechanics for). Other changes include: \n<ul>\n<li> Support for different 'levels of power' in PC creation (i.e, Ostensibly Normal Folks, Cinematic Action Heroes, and Heroes of Legend)</li>\n<li>A lower default target number for die rolls (13, rather than 15)</li>\n<li>More examples culled from many different genres</li>\n<li>Inline text boxes discussing how rules from standard d20 products (e.g., feats, skills, saving throws, etc) can be easily integrated</li>\n<li>Tons more GM advice, in keeping with the goal of "being accessible"</li>\n<li>Tighter integration with standard d20 in regard to Challenge Ratings and balance</li>\n<li>A smaller footprint and print-worthy font selection</li>\n<li>Artwork! Yay!</li></ul>\nI'm still a bit hung up on the ashcan cover, though I know that it must be something special. I'm considering a hand-painted or foil-stamped cardstock cover with a saddle-stiched or metal coil binding. I would really like to hand-stitch the binding with catgut, though that's a rather time-consuming process that I think would raise the price point too high for my tastes. The goal is for the ashcan to come in at under $20 and the later, unlimited, release to come in at $10 or less (yes, yes, it's all about being accessible).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94055/#Comment_94055" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T12:57:09+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 12:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's nothing wrong with hit points.

The three primary design goals were Accessibility, Compatibility, and Simplicity (all of which overlap to some degree). For me, it's a winner because it lets me use stuff from the myriad d20 products that I own (from D&amp;D 3x to BESM d20) with conversion that can be done on the fly. I think, with the new edition of D&amp;D on the way, there is definitely a market for such a thing (especially given that EZ20 should have a high degree of compatibility with that game, as well). So, I guess, my hope is that it can serve as a kind of 'bridge system' for d20 fans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
