After long months without any news, Caligula comes back without a protection suit and with a heavy canvas bag on his back.

Men, beasts and Gods of the Tundra try to survive, fighting against nature and between each other. They quarrel, hunt, eat, love, fuck and terrorize each other. Below, the Hollow Earth, realm of the spirits, the dead, the futures and the pasts. The Tundra is the realm of the Almighty Frost-Father, a divinity associated with Hunting and Frost. But it's also a moving place, an attractive place for its resources and the traces of the past ice has miraculously preserved. Thus, it's a place of death, of survival hanging by a thread, but also a country of hope and absolutism.<br/></i><br/>We try to show all the respect we have for native people from Finland, Russia and Bering Detroit and for people living with the Down Syndrome but as we are not concerned people and as this is roleplay (fictionial and partly improvisated), we may have made some mistakes and misinterpretations, so please tell us in the comments.<br/><br/>Marc and Selene are born-french speakers but their english is fluently.
