It's a mini game that's part of a larger game thing, but this part is pretty stand-alone.  The idea is a quick little jousting game, where two players use skill and guessing to try to win.  <br/><br/>Here are the rules as they stand at the moment:<br/><br/>First, both players secretly set their die to a number.  THEY DO NOT ROLL THE DIE.  They just choose a number.  They can keep it under a cup, or their hand or something.<br/><br/>Then, they bid any amount of points.  These points come from another part of the wider game, but I can mess around with them a little.  I'm thinking that they're kinda scarce though, so that one or zero will be the most common bid, and it'll only go above that for really powerful knights.  Maybe most folk will start with about 4 or five?  They hold tokens in their hands, or write them down (or theoretically they could use another die but that would be a bit confusing). <br/><br/>Both players reveal their bid and their number.<br/><br/>The highest bidding knight has "dominance".  They claim a little chess piece knight to represent that.  If both knights bid equal points, dominance passes to the knight who didn't have it last round.  Then, the numbers on the dice are added up, and compared to this chart:<br/><br/>12-11: Unhorsed.  The non-dominant knight is unhorsed, and loses.<br/>10-8: Point.  The dominant knight wins a point.<br/>7: Point. The knight with the highest die wins a point.<br/>6-5: Pass. The non-dominant knight takes any advantage points bid by the dominant knight.<br/>4-3: The non-dominant knight wins a point.<br/>2: Unhorsed: The dominant knight is unhorsed, and loses.<br/><br/>First to three points, or to unhorse their opponent, wins.<br/><br/>So, on paper (by which I mean on the screen, since I've never written it on paper) this looks ok.  There's a reason and a counter-reason for choosing each number.  You can go in with a high number and a really high bid, hoping that your opponent will do the same, but not bid quite as high.  If you fuck it up though, by not bidding high enough or because your opponent chooses a low number, you lose big.  You can go in with a lower number, like a four, which is ok.  If you win dominance, you might still score a point, and you're not going to get unhorsed if you lose dominance.  If they picked a three, you're going to win a point.  However, if they throw a two, you're going to lose anything you bid. <br/><br/>The problem is that some of the picks are just not as good as others.  The game's pretty resilient to any one dominant strategy, since picking the same way every time will make you easy to predict.  On the other hand, I think it's not ideal to have any one choice be clearly better, or uniformly bad.  <br/><br/>Problems: <br/><br/>The result for the six is a bit clumsy.  It's not quite right.  It's meant to act as an incentive for showing a three or two, and as a risk for showing a five.  As an incentive for a three it's pretty weak though, since to win anything from it, they'd need to throw a three as well, but also bid for dominance, which is a dumb move.  Why would you show a three?  You'll lose out on a seven, and you're still vulnerable to losing a point if they throw higher than that.  If they're throwing low, expecting you to be dominant, it might be good, but if you are dominant, it's a sucker's move.  Something needs to change.  <br/><br/>Bidding.  Currently, it's too easy to know how many advantage points your opponent has at any time.  There needs to be some random factor or something, but I don't know an elegant way to do it.  This is important for this reason, and also because I want knights to be able to take disadvantages if they want, which should reduce their advantage points.<br/><br/>Too many tokens! There are tokens as part of the wider game, and advantage tokens within this game, and there's a good possibility of other kinds of token before the game's over.  What to do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104531/#Comment_104531" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T06:51:34+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  6:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and the above is largely directly from my notes for the game, so sorry if it's a bit rambly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104571/#Comment_104571" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T08:36:43+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  8:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>Much of the strategy with this will be determined by the spending of Advantage Points.  I'm having some difficulty assessing what would be good strategies without knowing exactly how dearly players will hold them.  However, I see very little reason to throw a 2 or a 3.  Especially a 3.<br/><br/>Do the Advantage points feed back out into the rest of the game?  That might make the middling results more desirable...<br/><br/>But the minigame itself is playtestable.  You should give it a couple runs, and see what comes out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
