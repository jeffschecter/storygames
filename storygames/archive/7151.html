This represents your characters ability to change the game world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoever has the highest total Effect Points is known as the Winner of this Challenge. The other side is the Loser.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winner has one chance to spend points to cancel the Loser's Effect Points on a 1-for-1 basis (e.g., if I roll 160 and you roll 100, I can spend 60 of my 160 pts to lower your total to 40, leaving me with 100 left to spend). The only limit on this is it can only be done once and it cannot lower the Loser's total below zero.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Loser has points left, they have one chance to lower the Winner's total on a 1-for-1 basis following the same rules as the previous step.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Loser has any points left, they can buy whatever effects they like using the table below<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winner can spend the remaining Effect Points any way they choose, with one exception. They cannot remove an effect created by the Loser. They can remove Effects created by any player (including the GM) in a previous Scene though.<br/>\n<br/>\nEffect Costs:<br/>\nEffects<br/>\nAdd Standard Trait: 1<br/>\nAdd Ability: 10<br/>\nAdd Mark: 5<br/>\nAdd Power: 100<br/>\nAdd Weakness: 50<br/>\nAdd Super Power: 200<br/>\nAdd Super Weakness: 100<br/>\nRemove Standard Trait: 2<br/>\nRemove Ability: 5<br/>\nRemove Mark: 10<br/>\nRemove Power: 50<br/>\nRemove Weakness: 100<br/>\nRemove Super Power: 100<br/>\nRemove Super Weakness: 200<br/>\nHospitalize: (100 x Super Power Arena Tags) + (10 x Power Arena Tags) + Abilities - Marks - (10 x Weakness Arena Tags) - (100 x Super Weakness Arena Tags) - Target is wounded and is laid up in the hospital and unable to act Physically for the Duration<br/>\nIncapacitate: (100 x Super Power Arena Tags) + (10 x Power Arena Tags) + Abilities - Target is unable to act physically, mentally and socially for the Duration<br/>\n<br/>\nDuration<br/>\nOne Scene: 0 (This is 3 days or one scene, whichever occurs first)<br/>\nOne Day: 1 (Any number of scenes)<br/>\nOne Week: 10 (Any number of scenes)<br/>\nOne Month: 100 (Any number of scenes)<br/>\nOne Year: 300 (Any number of scenes)<br/>\nPermanent: 200 (Another Effect can still negate this though)<br/>\n<br/>\nTarget<br/>\nOne person: 0 (Besides self)<br/>\nSelf: 5 (Add this to another Target if you are affected along with others)<br/>\n2 to 20: 1 (Group)<br/>\n21 to 1,000: 3 (Village/Town)<br/>\n1,001 to 10,000: 5 (City)<br/>\n10,001 to 1,000,000: 10 (Big city)<br/>\n1,000,001 to 10,000,000: 20 (Region/Small Nation)<br/>\n10,000,001+: 100 (Large Nation/World)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, here is a scenario, that highlights how the mechanics work.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are playing Guillermo Perez, his stats are as follows:<br/>\nSuper Stretching (Super, Power, Physical)<br/>\nSuper Toughness (Super, Power, Physical)<br/>\nMartial Arts Training (Ability)<br/>\nComputer Science Degree (Ability)<br/>\nIntuitive (Ability)<br/>\nSelf-Reliant (Ability)<br/>\nDriven<br/>\nLoyal<br/>\nIdealist<br/>\nMark of Gullibility<br/>\nMark of One-Track Mind<br/>\nRigid Thinker (Weakness, Mental)<br/>\nBrutally Honest (Weakness, Social)<br/>\nGrit: 3<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have been battling against Terminull in a Physical Challenge (he tried to take over the world's economy using the internet and you could not let that stand) and finally won! His stats are:<br/>\nTerminull<br/>\nWired (Super, Power, Mental)<br/>\nHard Body (Power, Social)<br/>\nFighter (Ability)<br/>\nFriendly (Ability)<br/>\nIron Will (Ability)<br/>\nManipulative<br/>\nCurious<br/>\nHyper<br/>\nMark of Agitation<br/>\nNo Tolerance for Pain (Weakness, Physical)<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the battle, you used<br/>\nSuper Stretching<br/>\nGrit - Double Super Stretching<br/>\nSuper Toughness<br/>\nGrit - Double Super Toughness<br/>\nMartial Arts Training<br/>\nIntuitive<br/>\nGrit - cancel play of Rigid Thinker<br/>\n<br/>\nThey played:<br/>\nGrit - To play Wired<br/>\nGrit - To play Hard Body<br/>\nFighter<br/>\nFriendly<br/>\nIron Will<br/>\nGrit - Play Rigid Thinker against Guillermo (You need Grit, because its Mental)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now the World has been saved, the Die can be rolled and the EPs can be totaled up<br/>\nYou got 501 EP<br/>\nThey got 133 EP<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some Effect Costs:<br/>\nEffects<br/>\nTerminull has a Hospitalization cost of 102<br/>\n<br/>\nYou only have to buy Target and Duration once, but can buy multiple Traits<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you can spend EPs to cancel EPs of Terminull on a 1-for-1 bases (but not reduce him below 0)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you spend them?<br/>\nI would like two types of responses please:<br/>\n1) Ideal (in the spirit of the game)<br/>\n2) Broken (Meaning you would like the results as a player, but not as a GM)<br/>\nLet me know what you would do, thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS<br/>\n  Sorry about the long post and thanks for reading this far!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
