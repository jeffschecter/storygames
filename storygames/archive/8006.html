It seems like the Aliens are going to take out a player ot two per planet. Given that, wouldn't there be an incentive to work together rather than backstab each other? Even if you have your tactics down, it seems like upper echelons of the military are a bigger enemy/threat than the other players, no?<br/>\n  Also, the design seems real tight.

But it just works mechanically like any other weakness. The only difference is that it must be the final weakness for someone at the table. And what does that mean for your character? And how will that weakness, if used, affect the story, your character and the game? Do you die when you use it? It's on your terms how you lose, right?<br/><br/>When you reach the highest levels then your story is starting to come to an end, and at that point the rules say: up to now you could pick anything for a weakness (be it Cowardice, Greed, Lack of Moral Fibre, Pride, Optimistic, Fanatical Belief, Blood Lust, whatever), but the next one available has to be about losing because of a Hatred For Home.<br/><br/>It's a spike in the fiction.<br/><br/>I've heard some people say they'll use it to describe something unpleasant on Terra that makes them lose on some planet out there, and as a result they'll never want to go home -- they'll just give up on Terra. Others say they'll lose because of the Hatred For Home that's brewed over the course of the game and then they'll head home to take bloody revenge. I think you'll only know when you're going to use it. And it's a bit presumptious to speculate too much before you're there. After all, it might be a different character that gets that Weakness, and when you're <i>there</i> you might use it in a way you'd never have guessed.<br/><br/>As for why it's there? It's to bring into sharp focus the Trooper's feelings for Terra. But it's a long way off. Don't think too hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176888/#Comment_176888" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T11:25:38+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:25AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't played, this question is no more than theoretical for long, long time, even if you want to play that long.

Read the role-playing advice on p.15. That's really there to help you.<br/><br/>It's perfectly fine for you to say "This is what the Weakness is." It's also perfectly fine to listen to suggestions from the group and pick one of their suggestions, or something sparked by their suggestions. It's a group effort, but it's the player's decision about what their character actually does. It doesn't mean you have to carry all the weight.<br/><br/>When you see your first Strength and Weakness used in play, you'll see what they do and what sort of stuff your group is bringing in.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you're GMing, you need not worry at all. The GM never gets them and just gets to help the players with theirs if they want. The GM instead gets to just blow shit up as a multitude of (soon-to-be-extinct) alien races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176915/#Comment_176915" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T13:02:25+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  1:02PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the game you're a soldier following order defending your home from galactic enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you learn that most of those enemies aren't enemies at all...they just might be one day, mostly they just want to be left alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you learn that "defending your home" means committing mass genocide...for pretty much no reason what-so-ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you learn that the only reason the 3:16 even exists is to get pschopathic trouble makers like you off the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you learn that the folks back home you're out here "defending"...they don't want you back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won't have any trouble at all figuring out what "Hatred for home" means in your fiction once you've played enough for your players to start coming to the above realizations.
