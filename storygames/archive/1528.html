<p>So, today, I asked myself, "To what extent do we need these baroque dice mechanics?"</p>
<p>One of the things that, historically, I thought was cool about the Forge was that everyone had his own cool dice trick. But these days, in the sort of carefully constructed story games people are building, I'm wondering if dice mechanics need to or should be as grabby and attention-getting as they are.</p>
<p>HQ is gonna be my whipping boy here; I feel like a very similar behavior could be generated a lot more cleanly, without the wackiness of augmentation and masteries and bumps and on and on; the choices I make when applying abilities to a contest are enough, without the rather intricate processing and output I get from the mechanic.</p>

                            "Make the mechanics as simple as possible, but no simpler."<br/><br/>Can HQ really be done in a simpler way?  I don't know the game system enough to tell.  I'll take your word for it, though.  And if so then yeah, simplifying it down is a clear win.<br/><br/>But bear in mind that one of the things HQ does <i>may</i> be to focus your attention in certain places by making you spend time going through the mechanics in a particular way.  So just getting the same mechanical <i>outputs</i> doesn't necessarily mean that you're having the same effect on the players.<br/><br/>For instance, I could imagine a game where I required, by the rules, that people roll six d6s one at a time, pausing and making a notation after each one.  That wouldn't be any different (in mechanical outputs) from having them roll the whole pile, but it would get across an entirely different emotional tenor.                        </div>

                            Heroquest's math could be simplified.  They did it when going from DnD's 2e "THACO" to the "D20 + modifiers to beat AC + modifiers" in 3e, just by making armor class a number that increased rather than decreased as it got better.                        </div>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>The professional statistician in me screams that cool/unique/baroque dice/card/whatever mechanics are critical - that to believe anything else is heresy.<br/><br/>Alas, I think the reality is that the axiom of "Keep it Simple" is as true for story-games as it is for anything else.  That said, I have a much longer and baroque reply. <br/><br/>I think, fundamentally, the root question is "What makes a game?".  By creating OGLs, we essentially say, "The game is the mechanics.  And we own them - so you can't use them without our permission."  If this is the case, then game designers must design their own mechanics so as not to put themselves in danger of IP violation.  I think we all 'understand' the danger of creative license violation (ie., don't write a Star Trek game without a license from Paramont) and in this modern age of IP ownership, there is a natural concern as to how far that extends.<br/><br/>Does that mean we should all make games based on the basic mechanics that someone else has done before and released under OGL?  Not at all.  If you can make an improvement on an existing mechanic, you should.  <br/><br/>More importantly, if your mechanic supports the story (for instance, a poker-based mechanic for a story-game related to Vegas or the Old West might be very appropriate) I think using a custom mechanic is as important as setting material.<br/><br/>But in the end, your mechanic is only as good as how people use it.  For instance, growing up, I played "D&amp;D" with a couple different "GMs" who essentially ran everything with a single die - a d10 in at least one case. To me this makes a huge case for my original point, Keep It Simple.  Unless your cool mechanic supports your story, maybe a simple die roll is good enough.....                        </div>

                            One point that you may or may not give a rip about, Shreyas, is not so much what makes a great game as what makes a viable product.  If you simplify the game system far enough that it can be described on, say, one or two pages, then you are going to need a lot of other material to flesh out a complete book that customers might buy.  Combine this with some folks' avowed distaste for a canonized setting, and it's a very good question what goes into the book.  Now, your intentions may not be commercial, sure, in which case you get the Pool.  However, as long as the hobby runs off of books that are sold to players, there will be a significant pressure to include baroque die mechanics to some degree or another.                        </div>

<p>Tony, Er... I'm not sure that you got what I intended out of my post. I said that there are procedures in the game that make the dice complexity of that system <em>redundant</em>; I don't feel like all the math I do after choosing abilities adds any data.</p>
<p>It's just, like...we have <em>way better</em> attention and data tools than dice-linked procedures, eh.</p>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>This is a question with both an answer and no answer---"We need baroque mechanics as much as need baroque mechanics."<br/><br/>In other words, as long as baroque mechanics contribute to the designers intended vision (which could mean alot of things), then we need baroque mechanics. When baroque mechanics cease to contribute to/ support the designer's vision, then they should be simplified or dropped.<br/><br/>In that regard, you can only look at this issue on a case by case example, there is no generalized answer.                        </div>

                            I think the opportunity to tie fictional character decisions to mechanical decisions is being over looked.  I mean sure, in any the game you can ask the question of whether or not what you're trying to accomplish is worth physical violence, but Dogs in the Vineyard's Escalation mechanics embed that decision right into the dice themselves.  Sorcerer raises similar choices to be made by employing an uncertain ordering schema on upfront declared actions.  My Life with Master embeds choices about what makes my character worth loving in its Overture of Affection mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
It's not just "diffferent and fiddly" that make these games work for me.  It's the fact that those different and fiddley bits are tied directly to what matters in the fiction in ways that other games don't do.<br/>

                            I go with preferring simplicity. A good bit of my own fooling around with dice systems was motivated by wanting to get rid of the chart lookups and other goofy math of HQ, as well as having a fetish for the D6--the working-class die, by God! Of course I ended up drifting a good ways afield, but the curve is simple, just small pools of d6, take the highest--there's only a couple curves to know and after that it's all shifting with straight-up sums.<br/><br/>That said, if the dice wonkiness ties right in, I like it. Don't Rest Your Head is an excellent example. There are two readings on a roll necessary: you have to read how many 1-3s (successes, determining who wins) and the highest number picked from up to 4 sets (pain, discipline, exhaustion, and madness). But these do a lot more than determining success; they determine who wins, *and* at what cost, in one roll. That wins for simplicity and coolness.<br/><br/>--JB                        </div>

                            If part of the enjoyment is digging into a rich, chaotic system that can't be easily analyzed as a whole, and finding pockets of tactical benefit, then baroque is the way to go. Magic: The Gathering is my posterchild for this point. Old-school AD&amp;D similarly.                        </div>

<p>I've always thought there's a little too much obsession over having the funkiest dice (or other randomizer) mechanics.

Pick a couple basic mechanics you like, use the one that works best for your game, and add the other rules for special situations to get the results you need.</p>
<p>And I say this even though I've gone through a couple different dice techniques myself. But then, I've seen this more as a search for a mechanic I think fills my needs best. I'm planning on going back and changing the dice mechanics in my old games as I develop them into their final form.</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm with you, Shreyas. (I'd say I'm with Jonathan, too, except I suspect he's leaning towards diceless stuff. Heretic!)</p>

I find that a strange attitude myself.  How can you separate rules from the means by which they effect play?  I mean sure you could choose a single ruleset and then try to bend any concept into fitting that framework (see ubiquitous d20 games) but you end up with a more elegant (and playable) game by building the rules around the mechanics and the mechanics around the rules so that so that they reinforce and emphasise each other.<br/><br/>My personal crusade against the artificial separation of randomizer mechanics from rest of the ruleset aside, I judge the worth of "baroque dice mechanics" on the same criteria as other rules - what does it contribute to guiding the play of the game to matching the vision as closely as possible?  They should serve a specific purpose not just get used because they are funky or 'all the cool games use them'.  The three categories of impact are:<br/>(A) Color:  Contributing to the thematic space.  Generally by the type of randomizer chosen such as using cards (playing or Tarot) or Bacchanalâ€™s colored dice.<br/>(B) Focus and Feel:  What influences success and determines consequences.  Is it luck, training, inborn talent, passion, or thematic features (DitV escalating conflict and DRYH exhaustion and madness).<br/>(C) Pacing:  How quickly can the result be read, understood, and implemented into the game.  Referencing charts, rerolls, calculating modifiers, and choices or further rolls based on first result.<br/><br/>In Shreyas example, if the same result could have been reached through the same interactions while focusing on the same things then I would say the rules are unwieldy and should have been written differently, if it would have played out differently then the rules serve a purpose (However lacking any actual knowledge of the HQ system or your group I won't comment on whether this purpose is a net positive or negative influence).<br/><br/>I think that it comes down to the fact that one of the biggest hurdles for a designer is convincing gamers that they can play the game they want better if they use 'This Game' instead of 'That Game' which they already know and the main way to do that is to do <i>something</i> different.  Baroque dice mechanics get more attention than the corresponding baroque rules systems because they are bite sized examples of how 'This Game' does things differently than 'That Game'.  Ultimately we donâ€™t need these baroque dice mechanics but they do change the experience of play and will continue to exist to the extent that they attract more interest in a new game than they drive away.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I think HQ is designed to fill a couple of needs.<br/>
1) It is a way for players to indicate what they are interested in and where they are at (the freeform skill naming system is a very intuitive way for players and GMs to gauge where everyone is and what they want from the game, e.g, do they call their skill Sense Motive, Savoir Faire or Mother told me not to trust a stranger).<br/>
2) It is designed so that player's effort is rewarded mechanically (If a particular outcome is vital to the player, they can and probably will pile on the augs)<br/>
3) It is designed so that one bad roll, won't spoil the game (Masteries seem to compensate for the flat odds of a d20 pretty well)<br/>
  I don't know if that was the design goals of the writers and I don't know if there is a "better" way to do it. But, I do know that it comes a long with certain artifacts:<br/>
1) Leanring curve (W=Mastery, 20 skil levels=a mastery=W, etc)<br/>
2) Social contract dependance (More so than other systems, this game really relies on social conract. The augs could easily be abused. I haven't realy seen it, but I see that potential)<br/>
3) A moderate handling time (Not the slowest I have seen, but definitely not the fastest)<br/>
  In the end, I don't see how you could mod HQ to achieve the good while discarding the bad without re-writing the system. And I think its a fairly good system in that it uses conflict resolution in a pretty intuitive way and provides lots of useful ways for for the player to provide inputs into the current conflict.<br/>
  But, I will say that some systems drive me mad with the handling and fiddly bits of the rules. and not the ones you would think probably.<br/>
  Like I don't mind that Fudge has names for their level numbers and is written in such a way that the numbers can be completely obscured, but I do mind how fiddly Capes can be.<br/>

                            I was thinking about reward schedules in the psychological (Skinnerian) sense yesterday. You know how constant and predictable awards create a weaker behavioral response than irregular awards? I dawned on me that dice are a means of creating irregular and unpredictable rewards and that in itself creates a stronger reinforcement for the play behavior. <br/><br/>Could it be that games without dice fail to reinforce the fun of playing that game as strongly as games with dice, and thus games without dice evolve out?                        </div>

                            Adam:  One thing to bear in mind is that Skinner was working with critters that really don't have much of a "plan ahead" instinct.<br/><br/>When you scale it up to human beings, genuinely predictable outcomes can create a whole flotilla of behavioral responses because people start planning on the outcome, and hanging secondary behaviors off of those plans.<br/><br/>But yeah, the psychological impact that you get if you give a 2X reward 50% of the time is very different from the one you get when you give a 1X reward 100% of the time.                        </div>

                            Shreyas: you're right. <br/><br/>The functionalist purpose of most dice mechanics is to create a ritualized sequence of actions. For instance, in Dogs the ritual sequence of actions is <br/><br/>1. Player one narrates something, and makes a Raise.<br/>2. Player two pushes forward dice, compares, and based on the comparison either Sees, Takes the Blow or Gives.<br/><br/>The purpose of the ritual is to create a choice point where player two has to explicitly refute what player one says, explicitly affirm it, or to give up on the conflict. This means that when they repeat this ritual, the players repeatedly take each others' narrations into account. This has all sorts of good consequences for the strength and integrity of play, because the basic payoff of roleplaying is having the other players engage with your ideas, and Dogs makes you do it over and over. <br/><br/>But: why not just say "Explicitly affirm, refute, or give" as the basic mechanic? <br/><br/>Now we know that dice mechanics (or resource mechanics like Plot Points) can be helpful relative to pure freeform because they can be parasitic on our <em>moral</em> understanding of games. If breaking the ritual sequence of actions in a raise is cheating like cheating at cards, then the players are less likely to break that because they take it to be immoral. So a positive structure is enforced by our expectations about cheating and fair play.<br/><br/>But relative to more structured freeform? That's a horse of an entirely different color, isn't it?                        </div>
