I've been designing my own games for as long as I can remember, but I've never bothered to attempt to publish anything.  The effort required to push something beyond my own group always seemed to be a bit much.  But, having spent some time with people who were really passionate about their games online and at GenCon I've decided to at least make the effort, and let the results determine what happens next.<br/>\n<br/>\nThan came the issues.  I have this game that I've been working on for a couple years now.  I know it's not going to be the first thing I want to put out there, but it has this mechanic that doesn't really fit with what I was trying to do.  After listening to Master Plan <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2313&amp;Mode=like">#13</a> it occurred to me that what I needed was to divorce that mechanic from the larger system and spin it off into it's own game.  Since the mechanic emphasizes fast, simple, cinematic play I thought it might make a great first offering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem comes now to where I violated my own rules.  Specifically I have a system, but no setting.  This is a real issue for me for two reasons:  First, I don't want it to end up generic, because I feel like generic systems have no soul.  Second, I believe the best games are the ones whose mechanics are built around the game, rather than the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that I put that rule about not working on mechanics until I had a solid game idea in place because somewhere in my mind it really breaks down my creative process.  I have noticed over years of designing that games where I start with the world first become more story driven, games where I start with the game idea first become more player driven, and games where I start with mechanics first become more about what the characters can do.  That's not what I'm aiming for here, but I don't want to just throw out a good idea and start from scratch just because I can't wrap my head around a setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was just to pick out a genre and try running with it from there, but the fist two that popped into my mind were pulp and Hong Kong style action.  Both of which are already covered well by far better games.  Who wants to compete with things like Spirit of the Century or Feng Shui?  I just don't know what I have to add there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho, I'm not sure if this is just venting or something that anyone else can legitimately help with, but I'd appreciate any advice someone has to give.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93438/#Comment_93438" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T08:57:33+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  8:57AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Master of the Game</cite>I believe the best games are the ones whose mechanics are built around the game, rather than the other way around.</blockquote>\nI tend to disagree with this sentiment.  I've designed in both directions before.  From my perspective, the key thing is that whatever comes next builds on whatever came first, rather than the two things getting developed in parallel, disconnected from one another.  Make sure this connection between both halves exists, on the other hand, and do it often enough, and you'll find yourself often with a chicken-and-egg scenario, where some of your designs you simply can't tell which came first.  <br><br>If you have a killer system, you can examine it for the themes it conveys through the behavior of that system, and build a setting that shares those themes.  Much like, if you have a killer setting, you can examine it for the themes it conveys through the stories inherent in that setting, and build a system that encourages those stories to take place, sharing the themes.<br><br>So, that's where we start.  What does your system <i>do</i>?  And what does the system's behavior suggest as themes?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

No disapearing for a week this time.  Sorry again about that.  I'll be back on in the morning.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">It really started as a solution for an issue I'm having with my other game. I wanted a fairly typical roll-under percentile system, but I wasn't content with the degree of randomness that a straight percentile roll allows.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnable to find a good solution I came up with something that I thought offered some predictability and had some potential for an interesting tactical twist. Basically it works like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers have a stat called Centering. It basically represents perfect balance in one's life. The six other stats, which govern the usual things (combat, magic, intelligence, social acumen), all circle around Centering. Raising these things makes you better in the field they represent, but the further any stat is from your Centering, the smaller your die pool is. Hopefully this encourages balanced builds and gives non-magical or unenhanced characters a reason to shine without making focus characters any weaker.<br/>\n<br/>\nDie pools are important because players roll a number of dice equal to their pool at the beginning of an adventure. Then they line the dice up in front of them, and choose the ones they want to use each time they attempt to use a skill. This gets rid of most randomness and adds a tactical element to the game. Players must choose when to use their high rolls, while bleeding off low rolls on easy or unimportant tasks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a die is used, the player rerolls it and adds it back to their pool. The difficulty here is that, should you only use high rolls, eventually you're going to run out and you'll only have low rolls remaining. That's why having balance is important. Large dice pools mean lots of dice to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nDie pools also allow for Chaining, which is a little complicated, so I'll save that for later. Basically it just means creating action chains by sequencing the dice from your pool (and possibly the pools of allies who are assisting you).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that having a lot of dice just sitting there on the table is asking for trouble. While at GenCon I came up with an alternate idea. I would use cards instead of dice. Cards are easy to hold in large numbers, and much less likely to be knocked over. I really liked the idea, but it didn't really fit with what I was trying to do in the other game, so I spun the idea off into a game of its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem now is that I'm left with a conundrum. I have no idea what the new game is to be about, and it frustrates me because I can't just think of something. Every time I think about the game I focus on what the characters can do rather than who they are, and that's not what I want at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's an old problem of mine, and one I don't know how to get past. Whenever I design a game starting with the rules I always focus on powers over story or characters. I don't know what it is about my brain that just shuts down, but I do much better design work when I start with a solid game concept first, and just let the rules grow around it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that's it, that's why I frustrate myself. I know I have this problem, but I have no idea how to get around it.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Master%20of%20the%20Game" title="Master of the Game"><img alt="Master of the Game" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Master%20of%20the%20Game">Master of the Game</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95357/#Comment_95357" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T04:56:39+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  4:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bit more info on how the basic mechanic works, and hen I'm off to take the kids to school:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic mechanic for Chains of Aether is pretty simple.  Basically you just add your attribute plus skill (lower is better) together.  This gives you the target number for a task of average difficulty.  You then play a card.  If the card's value if above the target number, the task is a success.  The higher it is above the target number gives you the degree of success.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor tasks that are more difficult than usual you would increase the target number.  For easier tasks just increase the value of the card.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why the cards and card pools are important:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic idea of card pools is to allow the player to think tactically a bit and hopefully to encourage him to describe his actions with little fear of them failing.  Under most circumstances you will know whether or not you action is successful ahead of time because you get to decide which cards you are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other reason card pools are nice is because they allow for Chaining.  I'll go into that in a bit more depth some other time, but the basic idea is that the number of actions you are capable of in a round is only limited by the size of your card pool (though you can spend &lt;insert un-named action point mechanic here&gt; to add items to a chain).  As you describe your actions, you play a card.<br/>\n<br/>\nI leap up on the table &lt;play a card&gt;, kick the guy's shield out of the way &lt;play a card&gt;, punch him in the face &lt;play a card&gt;, and stab him with my sword &lt;play a card&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gives two benefits.  First, the only action that really matters is the last one, but you increase the degree of success by the amount that each action beat its target number (target numbers are set by your lowest skill used), less one for each action attempted (this number needs to be playtested, but it feels right for now).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, each chain has a pay-off.  The strength of the pay-off is determined by the number of actions successfully chained.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, I'll go into this in more depth later, especially its non-combat applications and how it works with allies, but hopefully this is enough to give you the basic idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95413/#Comment_95413" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T08:38:55+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  8:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            what stories do you like to tell?

At least one combat a session (not a hard and fast rule, but rather an average), longer-term campaigns, cool character interactions, and an engaging story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chains of Aether thing came from a very early incarnation of the setting, an ancient Greek epic about larger than life heroes (in the Greek, children of gods sense).  After Scion came out the idea kinda lost it's luster and seemed a bit derivative.  The idea was that each of the heroes channeled \xc3\xa6ther (the substance of heaven, their divine essence) in different ways.  Some internalized it, making them capable of great physical feats, some channeled it in the form of magical effects, and some could transport themselves whole into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chaining part came from the system's key mechanic, chaining together actions to create extraordinary effects.  If I had to say what I thought was the coolest or most original part of the game, that'd be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just never bothered to change the title, since it's just a work in progress anyways.  I always hoped that something better would hit me along the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Master%20of%20the%20Game" title="Master of the Game"><img alt="Master of the Game" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Master%20of%20the%20Game">Master of the Game</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97169/#Comment_97169" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T10:20:58+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 10:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, it's been a few days, any thoughts at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97175/#Comment_97175" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T10:28:33+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 10:28AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure what answer you're looking for. I think if you want to make a pulp game or a kung fu game, you should do it. If you are looking for different genre suggestions, there are some above. It sounds like a cool mechanic and you should work on it until you find the story you want it to tell. Then tell that story.<br><br>FWIW, I like your mechanic for a shaolin kung-fu epic or for a Knights Templar/Illuminati game. But that's just my thinking.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
