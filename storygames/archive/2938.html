There are two main orientations, <em>task-oriented</em> and <em>relations-oriented</em>. The task-oriented roles focus on getting a particular thing done, and the relations-oriented roles focus on maintaining group cohesiveness. There's a third orientation, <em>self-centered</em>, which hinders group cohesion and task completion rather than helping either.</p>\n<p>My framework is essentially the same thing, although I called "relations-oriented" roles <em>Group-Focused</em>. I also split the task-oriented roles into three broad categories of task that are basic to role-playing: <em>Fiction-Focused</em> roles facilitate creating and maintaining the fictional world, <em>Answer-Focused</em> roles facilitate recalling information outside the fiction, either in the form of rules or expert knowledge outside the game, and <em>Mechanics-Focused</em> roles facilitate the actual mechanical tasks of recording, calculating, randomizing, and distributing game tokens or currency. All the roles can blend with each other.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66773/#Comment_66773" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T13:56:31+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  1:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the other thread, someone mentioned Belbin's team role theory, which reminded me of <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/work.php?work_id=250" rel="nofollow">this article of mine</a> about taking Belbin, mashing it up with adaptive software development and Kabbala, and applying it to creative collaboration.<br/><br/>Seriously.<br/><br/>It's informationally dense and somewhat off topic, but you may get something from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66837/#Comment_66837" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T18:28:24+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  6:28PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of quick points:<br/><br/>(1) It seems to reasonable to break out "task roles" (or task-oriented behaviors) into sub-categories based on rules-application, process-facilitation, and continuity-maintenance as John suggests. Is it worthwhile to try to break out group-oriented relational roles into similar subcategories, or is that a needless complication?<br/><br/>(2) In terms of a workplace group, it makes sense to think of "self-centered roles" as dysfunctional.

However the Forge is down for me and I'm not sure the search would work even if it were up, so I'm not sure if I'd be able to find them.<br/><br/>In any case, he had this very cool breakdown thing going on, with four categories, which went something like this, although I'm probably getting this all wrong:<br/><br/>background authority - The authority to say what is or has been in the game world. the town description worked out by the GM in Dogs is a form of this.<br/>plot authority - The authority to decide what happens next in terms of the game's major events - do they kill the guy, to they find the MacGuffin. In Dogs this authority lies in the resolution mechanics and with the judgments of the players.<br/>situational authority - The authority to decide how a scene is set up. Aggressive scene framing involves the exercising of this authority - saying who is in the next scene and who isn't, that kind of thing. A player might exercise this authority by saying "And that's when my guy shows up!"<br/>narration authority - The authority to say HOW the scene goes. For example, narrating the resolution of a conflict in Dogs. note this is different form the authority to decide, say, who wins a conflict (plot authority) - this is about, once it is decided that X wins, who or what has the authority to state exactly how X did it.<br/><br/>Something like that, anyway.<br/><br/>He also had commentary about other roles, from the authority who provides the room and the snacks, to the authority who knows and/or adjudicates the rules, to the authority who ensures we all stay within theme, to the authority who ensures we don't fight interpersonally, etc, and how all of these didn't need to be the same person and it was merely a historical accident that all of these things often ended up getting dumped on one person's shoulders.<br/><br/>If anyone else could find links to the relevant posts and stick them up here I'd be grateful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67007/#Comment_67007" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T10:38:54+00:00" title="May  6, 2007 10:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that post; it was brilliant, thanks for reminding me.

Task role behaviors include initiating processes and group actions, requesting information, giving information, facilitating procedures, requesting opinions, giving opinions, clarifying, summarizing and evaluating.<br/><br/>Relational orientation:  Working toward group cohesion.  Relational role behaviors include giving social support, facilitating, harmonizing, relieving tension, energizing, leading, following, compromising, and gatekeeping.<br/><br/>Self-centered orientation:  Working toward personal goals.  Self-centered role behaviors (within the confines of formal small group communications; I think we can find positive roles within this area) include "negative blocking" (nay-saying), dominating, attacking, and clowning around.  In gaming context, this becomes a \xe2\u20ac\u0153Worried about my own fun/worried about everyone\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fun\xe2\u20ac\x9d axis, perhaps.<br/><br/>This provide axes along which the \xe2\u20ac\u0153types\xe2\u20ac\x9d could be measured.  <br/><br/>John suggested a slightly different breakdown:<br/><br/>Answer-Focused roles facilitate recalling information outside the fiction, either in the form of rules or expert knowledge outside the game<br/><br/>Mechanics-Focused roles facilitate the actual mechanical tasks of recording, calculating, randomizing, and distributing game tokens or currency.<br/><br/>Fiction-Focused roles facilitate creating and maintaining the fictional world<br/><br/>Group-focused orientation:  Same as relational orientation above.  <br/><br/>We need to figure out if there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a need for the division between Answer-focused and Fiction-focused.  If they can be folded together, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s really no difference between these two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76571/#Comment_76571" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T05:20:38+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  5:20AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ... genuinely don't have opinions on this, except for a sort of "Watch your step" warning.

They're ways that people <i>shorthand</i> the social interactions at the table, because we do not have words enough (or time enough to say them all) to unpack that dense stream of constant nuance into something as paltry as language.

I hope the labels are useful but who really knows?  I'm trying to sort this all out myself.<br><br>Self, Group, and Task correlate to Bill's Self-centered, Relational, and Task-oriented.  Engagement is a crude fourth that encompasses some of what John was talking about, too.  If you look at what lies on the axes it should make sense.  <br><br><b>Your Fun! </b>is the person who subsumes their own fun on the altar of others.<br/><br/><b>Lonely Fun</b> is the guy who finds endless stemming enjoyment from solo RPG-related activities (is this relevant here?)<br/><br/><b>Our Fun!</b> is collective fun-seeking.<br/><br/><b>My Fun!</b> is toxic self interest at the expense of others.  <br/><br/><b>The Sage, </b>who is often a repeat player with an understanding of both the mechanical procedures and ineffable things like appropriate pacing and proper tone. <br/><br/><b>The Mechanic. </b> This is the person who knows how the rules apply to a given situation. Someone in the group says, "I want to do this" and he says, "Well, to do that, you have to do this...."<br/><br/><b>The Facilitator,</b> who things on track procedurally and keeping an eye out for inequities in spotlight time and so forth.<br/><br/><b>The Expert. </b> He tells people what to do, because he knows best.<br/><br/><b>The Vibe-Taker.</b>  His job is to pay attention to  emotional issues and energy levels. The Vibe Taker is the one who notices who is engaged and who isn't engaged, and gauges the general energy level of the group -- it's their job to call for breaks at appropriate points, and to focus attention on possible emotional conflicts and issues between players that could destabilize the game. <br/><br/><b>The Displaced Game Master</b> - the player who tends to GM often and, due to old habits, doesn't take well to the idea of being on the same playing field as the rest of the players and continually oversteps his roles.<br/><br/><b>The Enforcer, </b>who is a demanding participant who wants a high standard of play and holds feet to fire when necessary. <br/><b><br/>The Adversary.</b> Whenever the fiction is getting a little too easy and cuddly, this player drops the nuclear bomb, poisons the water supply, burns down the orphanage, and reveals that your mommy doesn't really love you.  PVP challenge is key.<br/><b><br/>The Opponent. </b> The adversary can be taking negatively as well, if it's taken too far. I don't just mean "woah, I didn't want to address those sort of issues in this game", but constantly escalating without giving the affected player a chance to explore the new situation.  PVP winning is key.<br/><br/><b>The Yes-Man: </b>this is the person who's the first to support anyone else's suggestion, essentially providing a general wave of approval for basically everything that comes his way. At his best, he's "Yes, but..." or "Yes, and...", expanding and/or modifying everyone else's ideas. He's also the group's cheerleader, providing the bulk of the praise/fan-mail/validation to everyone else. At his worst, he's the fog that obscures the consensus, by making it socially difficult for other people to say "No." Get two or three people like this in one gaming group and you'll get those games where everyone seems to be having fun and says they're having fun...and then after the session comment on all the things that they didn't like, or that they wish had been done instead. <br/><br/><b>The Workhorse.</b>  The player who always delivers - the person who the group, after a while, starts relying on to come up with creative initiatives<br/><br/><b>Slave Pony.</b>  Workhorse relied on to toxic excess.<br/><br/><b>The Designer.</b> He's not playing the game for fun as much as he is dissecting the rules to uncover their weaknesses. These players can be a little annoying as they won't let the game be the game.<br/><br/><b>The Skeptic.</b> the negative vibe player, who's insecure about how the game works/should work, and passive-aggressively questions everything<br/><br/><b>The Life of the Party </b>who is perhaps a little uncomfortable and consistently makes choices that are intended to elicit laughs.  <br/><br/><b>King Gonzo.</b> He's the player just going crazy and that everyone has to work together to reign in. He pushes the action to the breaking point and forces others to act.<br/><br/><b>The Deer in the Headlights. </b>This player always shows up for the game but is consistently the one saying, "I don't know. I pass. Come back to me later."<br/><br/><b>The Funny Guy.</b> He is empowered by not having a GM to "stop" him. So he looks at where the edges of the game are and tries to push them, mainly for comedic value. "We are in 19th century England? Cool, I want to be the guy with a steam-powered laptop."<br/><br/><b>The Drunk On His Own Power</b> player, who, suddenly free of "GM oppression" goes completely bonkers narrating the craziest stuff ever. Maybe that's just the Gonzo under a different flag.<br/><br/><b>The Zombie,</b> who is completely useless.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76678/#Comment_76678" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T13:14:55+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  1:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, thanks.<br/><br/>In the .pdf, you call The Mechanic the Rules Nerd, instead.<br/><br/>And yeah, I think Lonely Fun is relevant here, but only because I interpreted it in a different way than you just defined it.

It made me have a bunch of thoughts. Here they are.<br/><br/>Tony's post is very well said - we can watch these roles emerge in play but can we recognize when they're needed-but-missing, and if they are needed-but-missing, is there anything we can do about it? Presumably the reason the role is missing is because nobody at the table wants to be in that role ...<br/>(I'm setting up a straw man there. I think there must be stuff we can do about it, and expect people are already working on it.)<br/><br/>It's a minor nuance, but one of the GMish roles I find myself taking on even in games when someone else is the GM is the "more details please" person and the "ask questions" person; a fiction-focused role. We could come up with a name for that behavior or not: everybody has their own ideas of whats important in fiction (descriptive detail; exploring theme; recurring motifs; opposition/antagonism; pacing and climax; 'being interesting'; verisimilitude; etc) and they'll probably be pushing for what's important to them so maybe a catch-all like 'the fiction person' is fine - I see this as being different to the enforcer, because you can do it to an extent without ever really getting in someone's grill.<br/><br/>Some of the 'sweet' roles may be unnecessary in certain groups - very often we have trouble figuring out a game's rules or playing by the book but we end up with awesome anyhow, for example - the rules nerd might help bring some flow here but we can get by without them. <br/><br/>I don't see the 'yes man' (yes person?) as being an extreme enforcer - the 'yes man' is group-oriented - it's more important to him to keep flow going, to make it so people don't feel judged, so they're more willing to contribute. I'm often a yes man but rarely a get-in-your-grill enforcer. I almost never say, "Eh, that's okay, can we come up with something better?"<br/><br/>This thread is interesting to me as a manager as well.  There are plenty of companies (like Gore Associates and Valve) that have found success by flattening their hierarchies, refusing to give people titles, and letting leadership emerge naturally in groups. The majority of people at these companies then self-report that they've taken on leadership roles. But I haven't seen much study on the kinds of leadership that emerge. A lot of these terms we've come up with map into the business world. <br/><br/>Speaking of business, and <i>hiring </i>and <i>firing</i>, how about some meta-game authority positions - who gets the group together, decides who's going to be in, guides what we're going to play, and who's going to not be invited next time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339984/#Comment_339984" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T10:44:11+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 10:44AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ivan, Jason's model is really interesting but specifically interested in play in which the social/authority relations between the players are more of an emergant property rather than something that the rules of the game deal explicitly with.  That's really only part of the story as far as GM-less play is concerned, especially since many games are much more explicit about player roles and responsibilities.  That said, I think folks tend to analyze those latter games based on the rules and player adherance to them -- since, supposedly, players are using those to help determine social/authority relations -- rather than looking at how existing social relations + attempts at rules adherance = new kinds of interactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339986/#Comment_339986" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T10:49:34+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 10:49AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2 0 0 7                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339992/#Comment_339992" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T11:06:02+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 11:06AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, do you have a link to something more up to date that you consider to be the state of the art in GM-less/full game classification? <br/><br/>I keep going in circles and I could use someone else's work as a starting point :-)<br/><br/>i.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339995/#Comment_339995" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T11:16:56+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 11:16AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The smartest person I know who is thinking about this topic in a rigorous way is Emily Care Boss.

The group and self lines in the PDF remind me of something that happened in a sociometry workshop. (In brief, sociometry is a set of techniques to explore a group's dynamics, and often shows up as warm-up and trust-building exercises in group therapy setting.)  We'd each written goals for the week, and midway through the week the facilitator asked us to look around the room, pick someone and name one of their goals that was still unmet.<br/><br/>The effect was magical, and I was floored because it was at that point I realized the facilitator was tracking variables that hadn't even occurred to me, namely the self-/group-mindedness of the participants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340172/#Comment_340172" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-23T11:03:24+00:00" title="August 23, 2011 11:03AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there could be a test to determine which kind of player you are in a certain group? It would be great if types of players could be identified before the game starts, and given specific roles and tools to empower them (perhaps not everyone all the time) and prevent the developing of dysfunctional player behaviors.<br/><br/>There could even be tools to manage dysfunctional playing. Like, giving the adversary temporary control of the NPCs when there's a battle; Or leaving the creation of temporal house rules to the Designer or the Skeptic. Perhaps we're on the edge of a game that won't assume you are a "good" player, but one that will empower your way of playing and make you (and the rest of the group) feel comfortable about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
