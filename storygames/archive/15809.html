Because I'm running it in FATE,  Dresden Files, to be precise). With any luck, we're also going to have an Artist Alley's table this year with Swag and free copies of the Bliss Stage: Love Is Your Weapon demo.<br/><br/>So what all would you like to see at the con, or at those panels?  I'm open to suggestions and ideas.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359042/#Comment_359042" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T07:56:09+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  7:56AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really cool!
