If you feel like I'm leaving something out please ask me and I'll clarify.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two main internet forums for indie games in Swedish is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rollspel.nu/" rel="nofollow">Rollspel.nu</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpglab.net/" rel="nofollow">RPG Lab</a>. Rollspel.nu has a forum category for independent publishers, much like The Forge, but I would say the traffic there is low. Many of the publishers seem to have abandoned their games, but the forums are still there. Rollspel.nu has 7613 registered users, and the forums for roleplaying game design and general discussions are very good.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the independent forums is the Dogma forum. The Dogma competition ran on Rollspel.nu between 2003 and 2005, and generated a lot of small neat games. One of the requirements for the competition was that the game should fit on the front and back of an A4 paper, so the resulting designs are focused by necessity. I contributed three games to the 2005 competition, and played a couple of the other entries.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotable games in the 2005 competition was Protest! by Tobias Rades\xc3\xa4ter (Gurgeh) and Lone Wolf and Cub by Krister Sundelin. In Protest! you half-LARP a trial, with one player as the prosecutor, one as the defense attorney, the game master as the judge and two or more players as the lawyers' assistants, and witnesses. So the prosecutor's assistant doubles as the prosecutor's witnesses, and the same with the attorney's assistant. Random cards can be used to call surprise witnesses, discard evidence and so on. I've played it twice and had a lot of fun both times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Lone Wolf and Cub the game master only control two characters: Lone Wolf and the Cub. Players have a pool of resources that can be spent on characters they introduce to the story. Through a conflict resolution system based on betting the player either loses the resources spent on the character or increases the resources to be used on introducing other characters. I really enjoyed the story we created when we played it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in 2005-2006 the person responsible for the Dogma competition was banned from Rollspel.nu and started RPG Lab. The competition has continued there, but I haven't followed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne game I think would interest you, Matthijs, is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.oktoberlandet.se/" rel="nofollow">Oktoberlandet - Hammaren &amp; Trollsp\xc3\xb6t</a> (The October Land - The Hammer &amp; the Magic Wand) from 2006. It's a steampunk game of elves and fairies during the Russian revolution. From what I've seen the game system is very traditional, but what's interesting is that all setting material is presented by an unreliable narrator in different stories presented in the game. The author is very passionate about having each group play their own interpretation of the setting, and often encourages discussion on setting creation at Rollspel.nu.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Anders said I wrote the game master chapter in Noir, with a lot of inspiration from Sorcerer's relationship maps, kickers and bang, and Chris Chinn's blog Deep in the Game. Marco Behrmann, the producer of the game, contacted me with a wish for a framework for the storyteller to run player character centered stories, and I simply used the best I could find on the subject as a basis for that chapter. The rules were already written at that point, so I was a bit hesitant at first, but when I saw the rules I knew they would support bang driven stories very well. It's not an example of a small focused indie game, but parts of it are clearly inspired by them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on, but I'll let you in with a reply first. Is there anything in particular you're interested in? There are a lot of games in various stages of production at the moment, and if you want to I could give some more examples. Have you checked out <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://staden.org/" rel="nofollow">Ber\xc3\xa4ttelser fr\xc3\xa5n Staden</a> (Tales From the City) that Anders mentioned?

Thanks for all the replies, especially Jonas' long exposition.<br><br>I'm primarily interested in hearing about the things that set Swedish RPGs apart from other RPGs. Every country has its own thing(s) - the Finnish larp/RPG crossovers, for example, and the Danish "systemless" scenarios that still have rules that structure narrative (such as Guernica). <br><br>What are some examples of interesting Swedish-style games, techniques, ideas?
