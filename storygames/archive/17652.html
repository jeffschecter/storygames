I did a bunch of math and really liked what I found. You can get <i>great</i> results in Apocalypse World by changing the die types used instead of using adding or subtracting points. (Additional dice are great for turning misses into partial hits.)<br/><br/>This allows you to use Dogs in the Vineyard-type Traits with Apocalypse World mechanics.<br/><br/>So, here's a proof of concept game using this principle:<br/><br/><a href="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/62455318/The%20Bureau.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Bureau</a><br/><br/><b><i>The Bureau is an Apocalypse World hack (really more of a World of Dungeons hack, as it has no playbooks) suitable for kids. You play secret Agents protecting humanity from supernatural threats: it's basically Men in Black meets Ghostbusters.<br/></i></b><br/><br/>While I'd love to hear your thoughts on the game, I'd really like to see where this concept might go next. I think it opens up the door to new ways of hacking Apocalypse World and new ways of structuring moves (which my simple game doesn't have).<br/><br/>EDIT: Updated link above with new version, Jan 7, 2013.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399735/#Comment_399735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T17:52:59+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  5:52PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DUDE.

For instance, in Deadlands character with Strength (1d8) and Fighting (1d6) would roll a 1d6 and a 1d8 to swing a punch. Though that's about as far as the connection goes since Deadlands dice system resolution is far different from yours. It's a more complicated pick highest die and match against success number, exploding dice, rises, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Anyways, it's interesting that you have done away with playbooks in favor of a more build your own character approach by adding skills (verbs) and additional bonuses (nouns). The Apocalypse World system discarded the traditional attribute + skill system in favor of special moves for each playbook, which it gets away with as the playbooks are so well done and the special moves are evocative of the character archetype they are striving for. It's a thematic choice really where in AW everyone is playing a very unique badass character \u2014 "While there may be other gun luggers, you are The Gun Lugger." Almost all of the theme of AW comes directly from these playbooks where many of the special moves go beyond just skills and become special abilities that change how the characters interact with the world and solve problems (The Gun Lugger solves problems with bullets, the Hardholder with politics). In a way these very strongly distinct characters leads towards a more cinematic approach \u2014 somewhat tellingly, Baker has stated that he modeled most of the playbooks off of characters from Firefly.<br/><br/>By doing away with the playbooks and introducing a more flexible build your own character attr + skill + bonus system, it puts the characters a bit more on equal footing as they can specialize in similar things if they want to. This works actually with your game world in that you are all Bureau agents that are part of a team so it is assumed that there will be some similarly in skills and <i>how they interact with the world and solve problems</i>. Obviously there will likely be differences in the characters as players will build them differently and try to specialize; however, not quite on the level of <i>everyone is unique snowflake</i> that AW does. Again, it's a thematic choice rather than a <i>one way is better than the other</i> thing.<br/><br/>On a side note, you should totally check out Monster of the Week if you haven't already as it is an AW-hack that is all about fighting things that go bump in the night like "The Bureau" however keeps the <i>everyone is a unique snowflake</i> playbooks thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399754/#Comment_399754" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T20:35:04+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  8:35PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

At some point with AW it's just time to end the campaign or restart with a different character, which is fine but again a thematic choice.

The design sure is prettier than mine (which is non-existent). What font are you using?<br/><br/>For some reason it never occurred to me to set a different "target number" for partial and full hits. Interesting! I wonder if that would be confusing or totally natural.<br/><br/>My little hack is just a thought I had, really, not a developed game. Maybe playbooks would be better? I just don't have the patience for them at the moment, and I imagine playing this game with kids who prefer to use their imagination and a blank slate to start with.<br/><br/>One thing I do wonder about, though, is the lack of basic moves (which I basically took from World of Dungeons). I don't feel like I would miss basic moves all too much... but I might miss the information-gathering moves ("read a...").<br/><br/>You could port them pretty easily, of course. <br/><br/>Counting "hits" on each die that turns up 4+ also gives pretty good odds with this system, though. Each "hit" gives a piece of information or an answer to a question. <br/><br/>For "+1 forward" results, if you have them, you can hand out an extra d4.<br/><br/>What do you think?

I'm familiar with it, but hadn't reread it for a while. That said, Simple World seems complicated to me. In my hack (for example), the kids don't have to do math in their head: you always just add two numbers. You never add two dice, a modifier from your sheet, AND other modifiers (like moves or +1forward-type bonuses). It's easier and faster.<br/><br/>What kind of playbooks/roles would you recommend for Bureau Agents? I could see stereotypes being based on age/seniority, but I'm not sure how helpful it actually would be to kids playing the game.<br/><br/>That said, it reminds me of something I left out: the harm rules. I'll post them later today.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm not sure if the varying dice types will screw with the AW's target numbers.</blockquote>\nWell, this is the only part of the game that's really something new or worthwhile. I calculated probabilities for most possible dice combinations, and I like them a great deal. That's the real innovation in this game: everything else is just slapped-together mechanics from other games (kind of like Lady Blackbird's design).<br/><br/>If you're ever rolling dice bigger than d6+d8+d8 (or d6+d6+d10 - these are pretty close to rolling a +3 stat in AW), then the odds start to break: it's almost a guaranteed success. But that's fine: these Agents will do really well when they're using Action Dice or using their best Terms together.<br/><br/>But, for example, d8+d6+d4 (as in the example in the text) gives very nice odds (approximately):<br/><br/>10+  36%<br/>7-9  42%<br/>6-   20%<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399789/#Comment_399789" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T08:21:15+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  8:21AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Physical Harm</b><br/> <br/>In a violent or dangerous situation like a fight, you can use these rules if you need a guideline:<br/> <br/>* The first time someone does something dangerous or hurtful to an Agent, just describe the effects.

Tell them they're stunned: they'll need to roll the dice just to get back on their feet. Or tell them something bad has happened (for example, maybe their enemy has accomplished something they were trying to stop them from doing).<br/>* The third time, they are defeated, out of the action. Maybe knocked out, captured, or just lying on the ground wheezing, in great pain.

The next time they're in a fight or kerfuffle, you'll start all over: there is no such thing as real lasting harm.<br/> <br/>Enemies of the agents are usually defeated by any single successful action. Unusually tough enemies could require two or more successful actions or rolls, however.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399794/#Comment_399794" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T08:50:16+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  8:50AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Upon further reading, I LOVE the way the characters can "grow out of traits" almost like buying off a key.

I calculated probabilities for most possible dice combinations, and I like them a great deal. That's the real innovation in this game: everything else is just slapped-together mechanics from other games (kind of like Lady Blackbird's design).<br/><br/>If you're ever rolling dice bigger than d6+d8+d8 (or d6+d6+d10 - these are pretty close to rolling a +3 stat in AW), then the odds start to break: it's almost a guaranteed success. But that's fine: these Agents will do really well when they're using Action Dice or using their best Terms together.<br/><br/>But, for example, d8+d6+d4 (as in the example in the text) gives very nice odds (approximately):<br/><br/>10+  36%<br/>7-9  42%<br/>6-   20%<br/><br/><br/></blockquote>\nOh, I'm not sure if I made myself clear.

They way I do it in this hack, you choose one of these:<br/><br/>1. There's something threatening the character, which puts pressure on them to do what they're doing quickly or with extra care. <br/><br/>For instance, if you're hanging off the side of a flying car and trying to shoot at something, the danger is obviously that you fall. <br/><br/>For a complication, you get what you wanted, but the danger also comes true. Now you have a new problem to deal with.<br/><br/>So, on a 7-9, you hit whatever you were trying to hit, but you also go flying!<br/><br/>2. If what the player is trying to achieve can be broken down into two bits, do that and let them choose between the two.<br/><br/>For instance, you're trying to talk your way into some place you shouldn't be. So it sounds like you need a) the guard(s) to agree to let you in, but you also want to make that, b) they're not suspicious about you (e.g. they don't report you to their superiors, or take your fingerprints so they can identify you, or whatever).<br/><br/>So here you would say, "OK, they'll let you in, but they want to fingerprint you first." Or maybe, "They let you in, but as soon as you pass by you hear them on their walkie-talkies, describing you to the boss."<br/><br/>Those are the two options I put into this game.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>I also have an updated version of this, I'll try to upload it soon.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs" title="sbrplaysrpgs"><img alt="sbrplaysrpgs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/050/n24UD1GW770MM.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs">sbrplaysrpgs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402586/#Comment_402586" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T11:20:48+00:00" title="January  3, 2013 11:20AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, thanks, Paul, that helps!<br/>After playing 2 sessions of Dungeon World I'm also a bit more experienced with the mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402639/#Comment_402639" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T23:04:02+00:00" title="January  3, 2013 11:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're welcome.<br/><br/>I should probably also upload the revised version of the text...
