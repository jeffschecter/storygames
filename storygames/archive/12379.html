At one point, one cow, in a demonic rage, charged Ethelbert.  Considering himself strong, he figured he could stand up against this oncoming bovine, and thus attempted to shoulder check it out of the way.  Unsurprisingly, the cow prevailed.<br/><br/>Upon rolling fallout after the conflict, I got long term fallout, so I decided to take a trait relating to my experience with the cow.  My new 1d4 trait became <b>"Faith Can Move Mountains, But Not Cows"</b>.<br/><br/>That trait has become one of my all time favorite Traits from my characters.<br/><br/>Let's hear some of yours...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This inevitably led to a nasty feedback loop whereby the relationship spiraled to double-digit numbers of d4s. If I remember correctly, the follow-up conflicts to the character trying to bash in the heads of "heathen" shopkeepers were usually fairly productive, surprisingly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278235/#Comment_278235" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T04:18:47+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  4:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "When the wind's in the right direction, I can still hear that bullet whistlin' towards my head." 2d10                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278317/#Comment_278317" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T11:36:15+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 11:36AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wife's first Dogs PC had "I hate heathens and atheists" at some decently large value.  This was a great trait because as a Dog she could apply it to nearly any conflict she got into.  But it required that she declare her opponent to be be some sort of heretic, going against church teaching.  So she was encouraged to make for a very black and white view of morality: anyone who disagreed with her was clearly not a proper worshipper of the Lord of Life.<br/><br/>Her narrow definition of moral teaching wound up with another, more accepting sort of Dog killing her in a duel, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
