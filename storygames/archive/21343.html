Fate's broad categories of actions are so nebulous that they can be applied to almost any scenario. (What's the difference between using Create an Advantage to create the Aspect of <b>Flesh Wound</b>and using Attack to inflict enough stress to create the Aspect of <b>Flesh Wound</b>? What about using a Contest to handle a fight, or what about using Overcome?) Compared to something like PbtA's moves, they're lackluster, providing little guidance or grounding within the fiction.<br/><br/>On the other hand, games in which the mechanics are overly detailed for specific actions likewise irk me. D&amp;D is the prime offender in this regard, but you can apply this criticism to any game with a strong emphasis on finely-grained combat rules: Runequest, Call of Cthulhu, Dark Heresy, Shadowrun, World of Darkness, etc. I don't want combat to be a separate minigame that grinds the game to a halt.<br/><br/>Are there any systems that provide a middle ground between these two methodologies (not PbtA)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467247/#Comment_467247" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T00:34:51+00:00" title="October 26, 2017 12:34AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2017 12:35AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this question.

Their strategies and chosen trade-offs?<br/><br/>If yes to either of the first two, then I think you wind up with the minigame phenomenon, as you start tracking time and space more precisely than you do otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467250/#Comment_467250" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T02:17:07+00:00" title="October 26, 2017  2:17AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a nebulous question, as there's another moving part - namely, yourself: what a given person considers complicated or unintuitive depends greatly on what you're accustomed to and interested in. For this reason it tends to be pretty subjective where the sweet spot on this matter lies.<br/><br/>I tried listing some games, but as David implies, it's sort of a narrow space where one can say with confidence that a game truly is roughly medium in complexity and detail. Here's my short-list of games you might consider:<br/><br/>Sorcerer<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>Tunnels &amp; Trolls<br/>other Vincent Baker games, particularly Dogs in the Vineyard<br/><br/>In case you're familiar with any of those, how would you say they stack against Apocalypse World in this regard?

Fate took me a while to get, but once I got it, it all made sense. <b>Flesh wound</b> would not be a created scene aspect, as created aspects are removed after the scene and are free to use by everyone once they are created. <b>Flesh wound</b> definitely sounds more like a consequence, a specifically negative aspect that sticks with the character for at least another scene iirc. There are different kind of aspects with different kind of rules applied to them.<br/><br/>Still I think I understand your question and it's not a fate system discussion, so I'll stop on the fate angle here.<br/><br/>I think it will always be quite hard to find the soft spot since so many rpg's focus on combat situations because they like that part of the story, which means there are many different rules for different kinds of combat or violence. Especially if you want it all to feel mechanically different, but then those combat situations tend to grind down to a halt, especially once you get to grappling.<br/><br/>While I haven't played it yet, there is the Burning Wheel approach, where you only get to a more grindy, time consuming mechanic if the fight is also narratively a big deal. Otherwise it's just a simple roll to check how it went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467257/#Comment_467257" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T09:33:16+00:00" title="October 26, 2017  9:33AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2017 9:38AM by Hasimir.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say... <b>most*</b> coherent designs do this by default?<br/>(my veiled critique being that Fate Core leaves a lot to be desired in this regard, and D&amp;D does not even qualify)<br/>Pretty much you have one clean <b>conflict</b> resolution mechanics that is then applied to any sort of conflict, maybe with some bells and strings on if the design calls for specific effects.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Don't Rest Your Head<br/>My Life With Master<br/>Montsegur 1244<br/>Prime Time Adventures<br/>etc..<br/><br/>The problem I have with your question though is that it is not clear what you are making a comparison between.<br/>On the one hand you have Fate Core, and your gripe here is that the rules are vague and muddy.<br/>On the other hand you have D&amp;D, and your gripe here is that the rules are complex and heavy.<br/>But these are two different axes.<br/>Fate is simpler than D&amp;D, but more vague.<br/>D&amp;D is clearer than Fate, but more complex.<br/>What kind of "middle ground" are you looking for? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>All the titles I mentioned before are much much simpler and lighter than even Fate, but are also much much clearer, less ambiguous, more focused and coherent.<br/>Is THIS what you're looking for?<br/><br/>The Burning Wheel and it's heirs (Mouseguard and Torchbearer) both have specific combat sub-systems, that are both cleaner than Fate and simpler than D&amp;D... but are still a different sub-system than the general non-combat resolution system.<br/><br/>So, <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> , could you expand your post more, to help us better understand what you are looking for? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>*</b><br/>I say "most" because there are also coherent designs that use effectively task resolution, or other alternative methods.

The game designer invested rule complexity, which is a very limited resource, in certain important actions that need it because of the intended purpose of the game, but you want rule complexity distributed differently because you want your game to be about something else. <br/><br/>For example, traditional D&amp;D combat is about rushing to deal enough damage to disable enemies before they kill us, and therefore calculating damage, blow by blow, is necessary and all rules about damage amount (extra attacks, damage reduction, critical hits, damage modifiers, etc.) and damage consequences (determining and increasing hit points, stages of not-quite-dying at low or negative hit points, etc.) are important and complex. (Making characters able to deal a lot of damage is a strategic goal for players that fits perfectly in the power-playing, character advancement mindset of D&amp;D).<br/><br/>If, instead, you wanted your combat to be about putting pressure on the character's personality, like in <i>Masks: a new generation</i>, D&amp;D rules would be a square peg in a round hole: no support for what you want and too much unjustified effort. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467262/#Comment_467262" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T14:27:01+00:00" title="October 26, 2017  2:27PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few thoughts on some of the suggestions offered:<br/><br/>Sorcerer's basic action type breakdown is just as broad as Fate's, but then it factors in a bunch of specifics such as which sorcerous ability you're using.  The lack of combat rounds and unlikelihood of multiple PCs in one combat results in a much simpler process than a typical World of Darkness combat.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard has a minigame for every conflict, not just for combat.<br/><br/>Don't Rest Your Head may give you a bit more fictional traction than Fate, as your decision of which <i>type</i> of power to use is <i>very</i> important and engenders corresponding narration.

It's fairly simple, but it allows a lot of flexibility. My primary complaint with it is that the intent aspect grinds up against my more traditional sensibilities. You inflict a minor wound against your opponent, but because your intent was to kill him, he's dead.<br/><br/>TSOY and Apocalyse World both comes close to my desires. Apocalypse World has the benefit of the fiction-first approach I appreciate. I can tell you that Mouseguard / Torchbearer's system is too abstract (it feels too much like a board game and lacks fictional input). The One Ring's combat system falls into the same trap.\n<blockquote>So, <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> , could you expand your post more, to help us better understand what you are looking for? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nYes.

Good going, just keep reading to form your own perspective.<br/><br/>Another suggestion that might prove interesting is some old-school edition of D&amp;D, LotFP or something of the sort. Those are less detailed than modern D&amp;D, but they delve deeper into detail as necessary by adding circumstance modifiers and whatnot, a bit like TSoY. I think that figuring out why that sort of combat system doesn't fit your tastes would be illuminating for further exploration (or if it does, well, problem solved).<br/><br/>Hey, I just realized that <i>Runeslayers</i> could potentially have precisely as much complexity as you're looking for in its combat system. It's very combat-focused, but simultaneously not extremely rules-heavy. Particularly the amount of options in combat is very low, even as it does detail hit locations and critical injury tables.<br/><br/>One more observation: I've seen people who have sort of similar tastes find satisfaction when they've taken a little bit firmer hold of one of those traditional systems, customizing them to their tastes. Many of these games really come from a grab-bag school of game design, and that long list of different combat maneuvers is really there "just in case" more than for any real reason. I've found that something like say WFRPG or modern D&amp;D or such games are relatively easy to strip down, and that's apparently what people who play these games usually do to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467314/#Comment_467314" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T10:47:19+00:00" title="October 29, 2017 10:47AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2017 6:34PM by DeReel.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same idea.

However I agree that it's mostly because I haven't found yet the game that gives me enough rules but leaves enough space for the kind of fun I'm looking for. This margin is different for every person, though if you learn to have fun with as many games as you can, you will find that the breach from too many rules to too few will become narrower.<br/><br/>For years I felt D&amp;D3.5 and 4e had too many rules for me to DM; then I fell in love with 5e and played as it is even using the encumbrance system. However I still don't feel comfortable with the way encounters are built and balanced. I can have fun with plain roll &amp; play homebrew systems, but Fate didn't inspire me too much, except to use aspects as flags. Part of the thing for me is that you may learn how to deal with different situations without using a system, but then you will have when a game makes you use the system to deal with those parts.<br/><br/>Yet this frustration is most of what makes me design games, so I'm ok with the irk I think :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
