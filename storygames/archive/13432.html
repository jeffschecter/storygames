Basically Ctech says "Okay, I can call that bluff." and posits a world where scientists, while going slowly insane, have developed a technological leap ahead for humanity based on the forbidden mathematics of the Great Old Ones. We get our flying cars and cheap energy from magic, basically.<br/><br/>Also, Ctech pushes the timeline along quite a bit, the world is much nearer to when the stars are right and the Earth is carelessly squashed by alien intelligences. Many alien forces have shown themselves (specifically the migou, the fungi from Yuggoth), and as a result, all of human society has lost a good deal of its grip on sanity. Imagine a world where your average Call of Cthulhu character would have a Sanity score 10 or so percentiles below what it would be in a game set in our world.<br/><br/>I've read some critiques of the setting that call the handling of the death of religion and nationalism "clumsy", and relate the homogenous one-world government more to the anime influences than to Lovecraft, but I think it's defensible.  I've often said that we are the degraded future Lovecraft was horrified to see coming. The fact that we enjoy our world of interracial marriage, porn on the Internet and reality TV in every home doesn't make it less horrifying to someone of Lovecraft's straightjacketed sensibilities - a man born too late to be a real Victorian prude but in all other ways qualified for the job.<br/><br/>Similarly, Lovecraft would put human institutions like religion into the category of things he would see breaking down in the face of cosmic horror.  These developments are not science fictional, they are part of the horror. It would be bad science fiction, I agree, to have a scenario in which the collapse of religion and nationalism was treated so casually.  But it is excellent Lovecraftian horror. It shows that even long-held constants are being flung out the window by a populace whose sense of humanity continues to break down in the face of cosmic knowledges.<br/><br/>I've found lots of interesting things in Cthulhutech, relating it to Lovecraft's work is really fruitful and helpful.<br/><br/>Oh, and here's the campaign: <a href="http://infrno.net/games/432" rel="nofollow">Gunfight Epiphany</a> if you want to join in.  I am still gathering players, I will "slowly" get things launched either in December or after the holidays.<br/><br/>Your thoughts on Cthulhutech and Lovecraftian stories would be appreciated, even if random!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303211/#Comment_303211" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T10:41:07+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 10:41AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game's full, but your noodlings are still appreciated if you have any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303212/#Comment_303212" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T10:48:28+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 10:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you say Lovecraftian, how do you mean? I mean, the technology theme plays around with some Lovecraftian ideas about mathematics and physics. That's rather neat.<br/><br/>But are CthulhuTech stories like Lovecraft's stories? Do you still get that idea of bleakness, that you can't do anything against the Mythos? Do you fight monsters? (Lovecraft's protagonists hardly ever fight monsters. You run away from them instead.)<br/><br/>I'm genuinely interested, not criticizing CthulhuTech.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303213/#Comment_303213" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T11:53:21+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 11:53AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not sure how one is "meant" to play Cthulhutech. I mean, one of the designers came to RinCon and I listened in on one of his sessions. I think you can and do fight some of the monsters directly.  (I also think many Lovecraft stories end with guns and explosions, whether they are wielded by the protagonist or not.)  To a degree, this is natural when you make concrete the creeping dread Lovecraft tried to wield. In other words, if you're going to posit a world with Mythosian technology, you've already positted a world where knowledge of the existence of these monsters is going to reach the general populace, and how they respond to that is part of the story.  But there are character types that are not particularly combat oriented.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that to a degee the bleakness may or may not be felt by the characters in the setting, but I think there's no question that the setting is meant to be bleak to the players of the game.  When it lovingly describes how drug legalization and rationing are the norm in the One World Government (tm), there's a strong sense that the players should chuckle somewhat nervously.  Humanity is on the brink of being wiped out by alien menaces, or becoming completely inhuman itself as it adopts the horrid ways of the aliens, and people are desperate to distract themselves with drugs, crazy sex and spectacle. In other words, I feel the bleakness when I read it, I don't know that all the characters are meant to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303255/#Comment_303255" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T17:59:03+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  5:59PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wasnt a major theme of Lovecraft the idea of losing one's humanity to technology? I think the theme should be those fighting the elder gods using tech can never again be a part of the world they seek to defend. The more powerful and capable you become, the more you give up of your own identity.
