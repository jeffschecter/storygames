At the same time, "The modal respondent now reports having <b>no confidant</b>; the modal respondent in 1985 had <b>three confidants.</b>"<br/><br/>In other words, the average person doesn't have enough friends for a four-player game.<br/><hr/><br/>As part of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21425/pet-games" rel="nofollow">a recent discussion</a>, I  skimmed a lot of story games. I noticed a pattern, which page 14 of <a href="http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/docs/Anima_Prime_CC_04-07-2011.pdf" rel="nofollow"><i>Anima Prime</i></a> sums up nicely:\n<blockquote><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What You Need to Play</span></b><br/><br/>First, you need one or more friends.</blockquote>\nOr page 30 of <i><a href="http://downloads.darkon.info/pdf/tsoy.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Yesterday</a></i>:\n<blockquote><b>7.1.2  Know your players</b><br/><br/>These people are probably your friends.  If not, you\u2019re in trouble.</blockquote>\n<hr/><br/>Using the AnyDice probability calculator, I've calculated the odds of a problem player ending up at someone's table (link to math <a href="http://anydice.com/program/e539" rel="nofollow">here</a>). My model assumes that, without friends, people will be forced to play with random strangers.<br/><br/>I define "problem player" as any player that can ruin a game. Newbies, people with different playstyles, self-centered pricks, the GM's girlfriend, whatever. They might not be malicious, they might not be bad players, but they will ruin everyone's fun. With my definition, I find it reasonable to assume 10% of the people looking to play are problem players.<br/><br/>In a four-player group (or three players and one GM), the odds you're playing with a problem are <b>27.1%</b>:<br/><br/>There is a <b>24.3%</b> chance of one problem player,<br/>a <b>2.7%</b> chance of two problem players,<br/>and a <b>0.1%</b> chance of three problem players.<br/><br/>In a five-player group (or four players and one GM), your odds increase to <b>34.39%</b>:<br/><br/>There is a <b>29.16%</b> chance of one problem player,<br/>a <b>4.86%</b> chance of two problem players,<br/>a <b>0.36%</b> chance of three problem players,<br/>and a <b>0.01%</b> chance of four problem players.<br/><br/>In a six-player group (or five players and one GM), your odds increase to <b>40.95%</b>:<br/><br/>There is a <b>32.8%</b> chance of one problem player,<br/>a <b>7.29%</b> chance of two problem players,<br/>a <b>0.81%</b> chance of three problem players,<br/>a <b>0.04%</b> chance of four problem players,<br/>and a less than <b>0.01%</b> chance of five problem players.<br/><br/>Personally, I think there's a lot more problem players out there than 10%. Let's bump that figure up to 20%.<br/><br/>In a four-player group (or three players and one GM), the odds you're playing with a problem are <b>48.8%</b>:<br/><br/>There is a <b>38.4%</b> chance of one problem player,<br/>a <b>9.6%</b> chance of two problem players,<br/>and a <b>0.8%</b> chance of three problem players.<br/><br/>In a five-player group (or four players and one GM), your odds increase to <b>59.04%</b>:<br/><br/>There is a <b>40.96%</b> chance of one problem player,<br/>a <b>15.36%</b> chance of two problem players,<br/>a <b>2.56%</b> chance of three problem players,<br/>and a <b>0.16%</b> chance of four problem players.<br/><br/>In a six-player group (or five players and one GM), your odds increase to <b>67.23%</b>:<br/><br/>There is a <b>40.96%</b> chance of one problem player,<br/>a <b>20.48%</b> chance of two problem players,<br/>a <b>5.12%</b> chance of three problem players,<br/>a <b>0.64%</b> chance of four problem players,<br/>and a <b>0.03%</b> chance of five problem players.<br/><hr/><br/>Let's do a thought experiment. Let's say your game's playerbase is 20% problem players. There are a hundred people currently looking to play your game. That leaves twenty problem players in your playerbase. If you don't accommodate those problem players, then your playerbase shrinks to eighty people. We'll assume your game has an average of four players per group. That leaves twenty groups that can play your game.<br/><br/>Except no. Twenty groups assumes your players 1), will find each other, and 2) are available to play at the same times. Which they won't, and they aren't.<br/><br/>Let's do a real experiment. Take a look on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/" rel="nofollow">r/lfg</a>. Find a group that:<br/><br/>1. Is playing Pathfinder,<br/>2. uses Roll20,<br/>3. meets once a week every Saturday,<br/>4. is planing to start a long term campaign,<br/>5. doesn't allow homebrew,<br/>6. wants a roleplay-focused game,<br/>7. and is only open to experienced players.<br/><br/>If you can't find a group, chose something to give up. What do you need to compromise? Are you willing to play with newbies? Maybe you'll switch your playstyle, or let homebrew into the mix? Perhaps you'll settle for one shots? Maybe you'll need to use a different system? Are you dead set on Roll20? D&amp;D isn't that different from Pathfinder, is it?<br/><br/><b>The less players available, the less likely any player finds a group they want.</b> And this is Pathfinder. Not exactly obscure. You, on the other hand, are a tiny indie designer. You're lucky if anyone knows your game exists. More than likely, one player will have to teach your game to the table. But even that's assuming they have friends to teach to.<br/><br/>If you lose the problem players, your game will die.<br/><hr/><br/>Okay, so there's a decent chance of a problem player being at the table. But there's also a chance there isn't. So how do you know who to trust?<br/><br/>I'm linking you to Nicky Case's free edu-game <i><a href="http://ncase.me/trust/" rel="nofollow">The Evolution of Trust</a></i>. The title screen says it takes ~30 minutes, but I've found it takes ~20. I highly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highly</span> recommend you play it, but since I don't trust you, here's a quote:\n<blockquote>Game theory has shown us the three things we need for the evolution of trust:<br/><br/>1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS<br/>Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve.<br/><br/>2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS<br/>You must be playing a non-zero-sum game, a game where it's at least possible that both players can be better off -- a win-win.<br/><br/>3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION<br/>If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving. </blockquote>\n(Seriously, <a href="http://ncase.me/trust/" rel="nofollow">play it.</a> It's amazing.)<br/><hr/><br/>What have we learned today?<br/><br/>We know that our players have legitimate reasons not to trust each other. We, as designers, cannot assume they're playing with friends. Without trust, there can be no cooperation.<br/><br/>We have techniques to build trust between strangers. If our games are to be cooperative or collaborative, then we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need</span> these techniques. Otherwise, people won't trust each other.<br/><br/>We also can't write players off as lost causes. We need every player, or our games won't get off the ground. In the worst case scenario, they might become unplayable.<br/><hr/><br/>That's it for now. While you're here, I recommend you check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="nofollow">KISS principle</a>. It's a popular design manta that helps reduce miscommunication.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time. I hope we can be friends.<br/><hr/><br/><small>Note: <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/10891/americans-satisfied-number-friends-closeness-friendships.aspx" rel="nofollow">a Gallup poll</a> from 2004 reported an average of nine friends. However, the American Sociological Review's study is considered more significant than Gallup's poll; The Review's study used the same methodology as a 1985 study. while the Gallup poll used new methodology. By Gallup's own admission, "question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls".</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468976/#Comment_468976" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T21:18:37+00:00" title="January 16, 2018  9:18PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh heh.

Since the days of the Forge I've been trying to convince people that <i>system matters</i> even for things like allowing problem players to play along with everyone. Whenever anyone posted about this or that problem player the negligent answer of a majority of comments everywhere has been <i>"then stop playing with that person, even if that person is your friend"</i>. I'm still sick of that answer to this day and that has influenced a lot of my design philosophy.<br/><br/>There are more mechanics besides those which help build trust that can help a lot with problematic players. Some of them deal with playing the game fast enough so players don't have time to get bored and think of making up some problem to have their fun. Streamlined but clear rules take care of ruleslawyers and munchkins, building over everyone's input is as good as rewarding them with game-currency and learning when to improvise and when to bring up the prepared material (and which kind of stuff is best prepped and which is best improvised) help us deal with trust in another level. Using clever questions to ask players for input has better, quicker and less stressful results than presenting them with the responsibility of producing that input by themselves while under the constant scrutiny of the group as a whole, facing the group veto or worse, their disinterest if they fail. And so on. <br/><br/>I've loved and learned lots of things from the designs of several indie games I've read and found through either SG and the Forge, but up to this day I can say that I've only been able to play but a few with my group. I've been told before that I'm underestimating them and that we should try anyway. They have seen the games themselves (without me suggesting anything nor either attacking or defending them, or even explaining too much) and they didn't get interested. I've got to admit that it's not just me, it's that they felt most of the games would trigger one or another of the problematic players in our group and thus while the concept sounded cool, it was easy to see how much problematic play they could create, while not providing enough tool to help us prevent it beyond the advice "don't play this game with problematic players".<br/><br/>We have tried lots of the mechanics of these games in our own campaings as houserules, to different degrees of success, which prompted me to change and include them in designs of my own, so I kinda know what kind of things work and don't work with my particular group of problematic players. But basically my advice to design in this fashion is <i>to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468980/#Comment_468980" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T22:38:21+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 10:38PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" rel="nofollow">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>We have techniques to build trust between strangers.

To that end we see things like the Same Page Tool, attempts to build and support communities both for individual games and similar groups of games, etc...<br/><br/>Beyond that, design-based approaches seem to be more about minimizing the impact of a "problem" player than attempts to "correct" them through game mechanics. Hyper-focused design, more horizontal decision-making and player empowerment (to prevent a single point of failure), and things like that. <br/><br/>I imagine that somewhere in the not-too-distant past lots of people came to the conclusion that these were easier (or maybe more ethical) approaches than attempting to use mechanics to train people to be the right kind of player, but that's just speculation on my part. To some extent, I think a long history of incoherent design and strong centralized GM powers were how game design approached this problem; mechanically there's something for everyone, and the biggest point of failure was invested in a role that had lots of strictures about fairness, obligation to the players, etc...<br/><br/>Edit to add: Just remembered the word I was searching for here: Transference! Instead of trusting each other, we simply have to trust in the game (or in the GM, in the Strong-GM paradigm). Why this approach has been seemingly the ideologically dominant one for so long is something I'm actually mildly curious about, now that you've suggested an alternative. Though I think in practice it usually functions as a stopgap until people who aren't interested in fixing their "problem" status move on. In the cases where the GM and/or the game conspire to "serve" the player, this may go on for a very long time, since there's no negative feedback to suggest they even need fixing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468987/#Comment_468987" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T23:56:50+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 11:56PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think trusting strangers is more an issue with D&amp;D, because people already know they want to play D&amp;D before they meet each other.

I especially like your notes on how game design plays an important factor in this.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree with the rather grim numbers you portray for "problem players" and how hard it is to gather a gaming group, however.<br/><br/>In my experience, I've never had much trouble finding players I enjoy gaming with; the challenge is always the logistics - time, place, scheduling, and so forth.<br/><br/>I think that, even if your numbers are correct, they ignore some other aspects of the "play cycle" - for instance, even if I only have two friends, I can quite quickly find out whether I enjoy playing with them or not, and then have each of them invite their two friends, find out whether I enjoy playing with *those* people, and so forth, until I have a decent group size.<br/><br/>Of course, that assumes that I'm a person who's fairly outgoing, willing to engage people in a weird activity, willing to admit to myself when it's not working, and so forth. These aren't givens, naturally - any given individual may have a lot more trouble.<br/><br/>If you're willing to play with strangers, of course, the internet has changed that aspect of life entirely - in a large city, it's generally very easy to do. In smaller places, maybe not so much. But anyone can play online (again, assuming they don't have personal issues which make that uncomfortable for them, provoke anxiety, or other such things). "Play by post" or "play by forum" games are a really easy form of gaming to get into, for instance, and you can maintain your anonymity while doing so, if social anxiety is an issue.<br/><br/>In any case, lots of interesting things to ponder here. I'm looking forward to trying out the "trust" game!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468996/#Comment_468996" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-17T15:22:02+00:00" title="January 17, 2018  3:22PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2018 3:22PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" rel="nofollow">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Even something as vanilla as D&amp;D puts the players on a team (mostly) (usually) (technically).

Those projects are, respectively: a precarious village; a company on a post-scarcity space station; capers and a climb up the faction ladder; and a ghost-busting company.<br/><br/>Capers and party ambition are common in RPGs -- Shadowrun is probably the poster child -- but Blades takes the extra step of relating the characters to each other in the die rolls which navigate the capers.<br/><br/>D&amp;D hacks which unite the characters before or during character creation are also winners in my book.

I feel like it comes to the right conclusions ("Including mechanisms in games that will help build trust is a good idea!") from a faulty premise ("The world is full of problem players, and if you don't invite them, you'll never manage to put a group together").<br/><br/>Since there's not much fun in agreeing with the former point (Good point! I like it! Please build games with trust-building mechanisms!) I'll unpack the latter a little.  First off, I think there's a problem with, as Paul alluded, how you define "problem players".  Newbies are definitely not problem players.   Indeed, "problem players" isn't even a cohesive category if you weed out newbies.  Is the guy who has to make constant Monty Python references a problem player? Maybe in Burning Wheel or Tenra Bansho Zero, but not so much in InSpectres.  Is the powergamer  a problem player?  Maybe in Pathfinder, but not so much in TBZ or Burning Wheel.  Is the guy who's just an asshole a problem player? YES, and no amount of game design is going to fix it.  <br/><br/>So I feel like we're actually doing a pretty good job of designing games that broaden the player pool, because as Paul said, often it's logistics more than personality that makes gaming hard, so games that don't require Every Thursday From Now Until Forever help.   Games with various sorts of collaboration mechanisms help.  All kinds of things help.  Adding mechanics that help build trust will help - though we may already have some.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469045/#Comment_469045" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T03:42:32+00:00" title="January 19, 2018  3:42AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Since there's not much fun in agreeing with the former point (Good point!

There's no guarantee who a problem player will be to any group, which makes identifying and weeding them out all the more difficult. For instance, you might not think newbies are "problem players", but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/7rc0rg/onlinepathfinder11_am_mst_looking_for_an/" rel="nofollow">other</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/7p9a7m/online5ecstlooking_for_a_few_experienced_but_open/" rel="nofollow">people</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/7c8vc1/online5thedcampaigndiscordroll20gmt2group_of_3_dm/" rel="nofollow">do</a>. In fact, being an experienced player is a selling point when looking for a group. A quick search on r/lfg for "experienced" brings up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/search?q=experienced&amp;restrict_sr=on" rel="nofollow">a heap of postings on the subject</a>. If you're fine putting up with the newbies, more power to you, but you don't speak for everyone. And unfortunately for game designers, we need to accommodate as many people as possible.<br/><br/>In my post, I included "people with incompatible playstyles" in my definition of problem players. This, by its vary nature, will vary from player to player. Everyone is a potential problem player. Me, you, everyone. The trick isn't isolating problem players; rather, we need to make people with different personalities, playstyles and experience levels gel together.<br/><br/>In addition, game design CAN fix "assholes". For instance, Riot Games (of League of Legends fame) found that <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/inside-the-largest-virtual-psychology-lab-in-the-world-7c0d2c43cda5" rel="nofollow">different colors of text change people's mood, thus reducing the likelyhood of them behaving in asshole behaviors.</a> Or you could use mechanics to disincentive bad behavior. For instance, say the players voted at the end of each session on who was the best sport. That player gets a bonus; maybe a free reroll to save for later, some bonus XP, or the chance to create a plot point for next session. Thus, asshole players put themselves at a disadvantage for being an asshole. Or you could tighten "fuzzy" rules to empower other players to throw the book at assholes. Or you create an elimination mechanic specifically designed to target assholes, thus taking them out of the game while everyone else plays. This isn't an unsolvable problem, because games are already finding ways to solve it.<br/><br/>Think of it like this: problem <i>players</i> aren't the problem. Problem <i>behaviors</i> are. Game designers, by disincentiving bad behavior and encouraging good behavior, can defuse problem players. In fact, you cite some games that eliminate problem behaviors through mechanics. Pathfinder incentives power gaming; TBZ and Burning Wheel don't. Thus, TBZ and Burning Wheel defuse power gaming before it starts. At least, according to what you've told me.<br/><br/>Take newbies. I consider a lack of experience a problem behavior, not because it's "bad" or "wrong", but because it can ruin other people's fun. If you're playing a team-based game, then having a newbie on your team will drag the team down. But game designers can combat this. There'e the age-old solution of handicaps for new players, thus allowing newbies to compete alongside pros. Reducing the time it takes to roll up characters (or, in extreme cases, removing permadeath entirely) will reduce the negative impact newbies can have. Or you could add newbie-friendly character options with low skill ceilings, such as D&amp;D's Fighter. By giving newbies a role, you turn them from a liability to an asset.<br/><br/>And just so we're clear: everything can be solved with game design. <i>Everything.</i> Since games began, designers have been solving problems first believed to be unsolvable. Remember when crunch was a part of the genre? Or when math was necessary? Even real-world problems are being tackled through gamification and well-designed incentive systems. If you see a problem and write it off as inevitable, then you're severely underestimating the power of game design. You don't need to believe me, but prepare yourself to be humbled in due time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469048/#Comment_469048" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T05:37:05+00:00" title="January 19, 2018  5:37AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The Quiet Year, FreeMarket, Blades in the Dark, and InSpectres all involve collaborative projects.</p></div></blockquote>\nCan't speak for the other games, but I'd argue <i>The Quiet Year</i> doesn't properly incentive collaboration.<br/><br/><b>DISCLAIMER: Properly arguing my case required eight paragraphs, as I needed to touch on core principles of games as media. Read it all, or don't read it at all.</b><br/><br/><b>DISCLAIMER 2: I do not own <i>The Quiet Year.</i> Instead, I base my arguments on what I've been able to learn of the game by studying the author's work and hearing the game's pitch. Because the game costs money, and I can't throw money at every game, my arguments still stand, at least from a reasonable consumer's prospective.</b><br/><br/>The problem's in the title: <i>The Quiet <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year</span></i>. The game ends not because of the player's actions, but at a set period of time. Once time is up, the game ends, no matter what the players did.<br/><br/>This on it's own isn't a problem. However, <i>The Quiet Year</i> also makes the fatal assumption the players care about the village. This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">horrible</span> idea. Why should anyone spend the effort protecting this fictional village? This isn't real; it's fiction. The only reason the village "exists" is because we want it to. And why should it? What makes this fictional village worth protecting?<br/><br/>I recognize the obvious answer; "the story, of course!" However, there's no guarantee it'll be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span> story, or at least have value. It's entirely possible <i>The Quiet Year</i> might have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">negative</span> value. What if your community survives by becoming a dictatorship? What kind of message would that be? What protections do I have against these messages? I don't need a guarantee, but I need something, anything. Right now, I have nothing to base my opinion on, and so I need to be skeptical, or else I risk exposing myself to incorrect messages.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to hear new opinions, but responsible opinions need to be backed up. I don't see <i>The Quiet Year</i> offering any evidence for its messaging, whatever it may be. By giving the players so much control, <i>The Quiet Year</i> allows them to create situations full cloth without giving proper justification. Thus, there's no guarantee <i>The Quiet Year</i> will accurately reflect reality. And if it doesn't reflect reality, how credible are its messages?<br/><br/>These guarantees aren't impossible or even unreasonable. All you need to do is make the story like reality unless noted. That is, if something's unrealistic, clearly point it out to the audience, or in <i>The Quiet Year's</i> case, the players. That way, the audience can know what parts of the story reflect reality, and what parts are artistic license. This can be explicit (disclaimers, self-aware jabs) or implicit (introducing magic to show that the story's science doesn't reflect reality, or having a presidential candidate win 110% of the vote to signal their rise to power isn't realistic). Without this signposting, the audience has no way of knowing what elements of the story reflect reality. thus putting them at risk of mistaking artistic license for realism.<br/><br/>I realize I'm giving this small sidenote a lot of attention, but it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> matters. Games are media; the messages they carry impact their players. That's the underlying assumption behind story games as a concept. If games can't impact their players, give them something to take with them when they leave the table, then they have no value outside of fleeting entertainment. And I will fight tooth and nail to defend impactful stories.<br/><br/>However, if we accept that games can impact their players, then we must also accept a bad game can negatively impact its players. To do otherwise would be to claim that messaging has no power when used for ill, as games are just as capable of carrying messaging as any other form of media. And if that's the case, then the entire history of propaganda, from those scary history class examples to everyday advertisements, must be discredited. If the entire advertising industry has no impact, then I'm going to need a really solid explanation on how it came it came to be in the first place, and how it continues to exist to this day.<br/><br/><i>The Quiet Year</i> needed to convince me its story had value. I found nothing. Thus, if I had to play <i>The Quiet Year</i>, I would purposely sabotage the community to prove none of it matters, as my actions don't affect the game anyways.

On a side note, some games come forward as soft and delicate cooperative day-to-day heartwarmers : forcing them to a grinding crash is not useful playtesting.

People care for what they invest into (irrationally so, Cf sunken costs). I think it is simple therefore robust.

Thus you plan to prove your point on problem players (or problem behaviors) by becoming one (or upholding one)! There's some genius to that! So brilliant! :DDDDD<br/><br/>More seriously, I have opinions about most of the points you raised, but it looks like it will take a lifetime to articulate them all. I might or might be going to that particular rabbit hole. First, though, consider:<br/><br/>Are we getting philosophical about games here, or are yours intended as practical objections to the design of existing games?<br/><br/>The context the thread sprung from looked like the latter, but reading it feels to me more like the former.<br/>In a strictly philosophical debate, your opinions are thought-provoking and entertaining to read. I can see them develop into something academic in format, perhaps. That's some cool art critique.<br/><br/>As far as practical game-design is concerned, though, it feels like you're getting ahead of yourself. Since several people report having had a good time playing, say, <i>The Quiet Year</i>, you should probably start from an assumption that the game works - it does for some - and approach it from a platform of trust. Games are only understood by playing them, and playing a game requires some trust in the game itself to work. There's no obligation of trying, of course, but that just means you could well leave that particular game alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469058/#Comment_469058" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T16:50:29+00:00" title="January 19, 2018  4:50PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not enough time to go over that whole post, but A) Maybe there's just a labeling problem here, because the idea that "anyone you don't want in your group" is a "problem player" is a sticking point for me that I feel undermines most of the rest of your arguments and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> No, game design cannot fix everything, because people can and do just ignore it.

I haven't played the game, so anything I say is hypothetical, to say the least.<br/><br/>However, isn't the whole premise of the game to tell the story of this village? <br/><br/>If so, then presumably people are choosing to play because they like that premise. You create the village together and breathe it to life - now you are effectively its creator, so you care about its fate. As DeReel says above, you're invested in it because of the creative effort you put into it; it's something you worked to build, so you automatically have investment in the premise.<br/><br/>Caring about the outcome of the fictional village is the premise of the game, it seems to me, much like caring about the adventurers surviving the dungeon and escaping with some treasure is the premise of a D&amp;D dungeon crawl. If you aren't interested in that premise, you should probably just play a different game.<br/><br/>Is your commentary on <i>The Quiet Year</i> just a very verbose way of saying, "I'm not interested in the premise of this game"?<br/><br/>That's a totally valid reaction to the game, I'd say; it's certainly not for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469062/#Comment_469062" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T17:51:28+00:00" title="January 19, 2018  5:51PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2018 5:55PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the premise doesn't grab you, don't play it.

In fact, my problems is that I will get invested. It's an irrational investment, and that scares me. Will I be able to question or critique the story, if that means invalidating all the work I've put into playing? I'm not sure I could. But from a critical standpoint, I shouldn't need to. You can still be emotionally invested in a story while being rational.<br/><br/>In fact, being rational can <i>increase</i> your emotional investment. Assuming the designer's story stands up to critical scrutiny and carries meaning, being rational will give you a real-world stake in whatever's being portrayed. The intrepid adventurers conquering evil can give you hope that you can triumph over your struggles, assuming the situation manages to be applicable to reality.<br/><br/>But don't take my word for it.

Tolkien:<br/><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/411971-i-cordially-dislike-allegory-in-all-its-manifestations-and-always" rel="nofollow"><br/>\u201cI cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.

What about people such as me that are turned away before ever purchasing the book? By only focusing on the positive experiences of some, you ignore the equally significant experiences of others. If three people enjoy a game, but a thousand people don't, why should I trust the game?<br/><br/>I do not believe games can only be understood by playing them. Design theories must be backed up by playtesting, but those theories can be used to extrapolate from playtesting. That's the whole point of design theories to begin with; we learn how games work, so we don't need to repeat past mistakes. Organizations like <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/" rel="nofollow">GDC</a>, academic journals like the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/gccis/gameeducationjournal/" rel="nofollow"><i>Journal of Game Design and Development Education</i></a> (and every other journal on <a href="https://www.igda.org/members/group_content_view.asp?group=137830&amp;id=457354" rel="nofollow">this list</a>), and institutions like ____ are all practiced in understanding games through theory. Theory backed by playtesting and other studies, but theory nonetheless.<br/><br/>Yes, many people report having a good time playing the game (for the sake of transparency, <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-quiet-year-brings-people-together-1785265299" rel="nofollow">here's an article I came across by Gita Jackson on just that</a>), but this presumes that these opinions are honest. There are a million reasons why incidental opinions may not reflect a work's quality. Desire to fit in or stand out, bias for/against the author, social expectations, etc. Marketing consultant Malcolm Gladwell lists a good deal of examples he's encountered in his work <a href="http://adage.com/article/viewpoint/focus-groups-abolished/104151/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Or you can look at the wonderful system that is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/steam-has-a-review-bomb-problem-but-will-todays-new-feature-fix-it/" rel="nofollow">Steam reviews</a>. If you've ever heard the term "review bomb", you know why self-reporting is worthless at best.<br/><br/>Games do need trust to work, and it's the responsibility of the game to foster that trust. Though I'm not sure if you dispute that. However, if the game's potential audience is "leaving that particular game alone", then the game is failing. Those are players that could be playing the game productively, but the environment the game fosters meant they're better off not playing. And a game you can't play isn't any fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469108/#Comment_469108" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T01:24:40+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  1:24AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Not enough time to go over that whole post, but A) Maybe there's just a labeling problem here, because the idea that "anyone you don't want in your group" is a "problem player" is a sticking point for me that I feel undermines most of the rest of your arguments and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> No, game design cannot fix everything, because people can and do just ignore it.  Look at all the stories floating around about how adding all this "new age" character stuff to D&amp;D doesn't influence people's play at all because they basically just skip over those rules.<br/><br/>You can only "fix" the behavior of people who are willing to have their behavior "fixed", and some people people will fight you tooth and nail on that. Sorry, but League of Legends still has a TERRIBLY TOXIC community, and all their game design efforts haven't changed that.  Those people don't want to change.</p></div></blockquote>\nFirst off, according to Riot's data, the League of Legends community <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/can-a-video-game-company-tame-toxic-behaviour-1.19647" rel="nofollow">is overwhelmingly friendly</a>:\n<blockquote>The resulting map of toxic behaviour was surprising. Common wisdom holds that the bulk of the cruelty on the Internet comes from a sliver of its inhabitants \u2014 the trolls. Indeed, Lin's team found that only about 1% of players were consistently toxic. But it turned out that these trolls produced only about 5% of the toxicity in League of Legends. \u201cThe vast majority was from the average person just having a bad day,\u201d says Lin. They behaved well for the most part, but lashed out on rare occasions.</blockquote>\nThose 1%? Theoretically, you might be able to change their behavior, but in practice, I don't know how that could happen, at least in a tabletop game. But that's still an incredibly small percentage. That makes 99% of "problem players" not so much a problem after all.<br/><br/>(There's also an argument to be made that LoL's playerbase is inherently toxic because of core game design decisions. Yannick LeJacq has an article that goes into more detail <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-league-of-legends-enables-toxicity-1693572469" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/>Speaking of "problem players"; I'm not a fan of the term. Personally, I prefer "problem behaviors". It's not the people that are the problem; it's the way they play. And the game shapes the way they play. <small><a href="http://ncase.me/trust//" rel="nofollow">Oh look a link to Nicky Case's game I wonder where that came from</a></small><br/><br/>As for the character stuff in D&amp;D? You don't need to tell me. I've been a DM; I've seen it ignore myself. However, D&amp;D's "character stuff" isn't being ignored because that's what people do. It's ignored because it's barely implemented. You can cut it out of the game entirely, and not a lot changes. So people do.<br/><br/>Think of it like this: what if your personality <i>increased your stats?</i> (D&amp;D calls them stats "attributes", but I'll call them stats for brevity) Yeah, you could cut it out, but why would you? You're losing out on stats! Not to mention all the extra hassle you'd have to do, decoupling it from the core mechanics. I don't think this would lead to players always using character stuff, but it would absolutely increase the amount of people using it.<br/><br/>(If you're looking to see something similar in action, check out the quirks system in <i><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/3e/gurpslite.pdf" rel="nofollow">GURPS</a></i>.

I see the game promising the world, but because the game has no guarantees of applicability, I don't see it delivering on its promises.<br/><br/>Sorry for the misunderstanding.

If someone forced me to the the table, then I'd be a problem player, but I know myself well enough not to put myself in that situation, for my own sake.<br/><br/>However, that does mean there's one less potential player, and I still consider that a failure. It's as much about marketing as game design, but considering most indie designers do their own marketing, there's still lessons to be learned.<br/><br/>Also, what if I didn't do my research? What if I found myself at the table knowing nothing about the game? Maybe my friend needed one more player and I happened to be available. How would you expect me to play? I'm screwed; I don't find value in playing it in good faith, but playing it in bad faith will ruin it for everyone else. But even if I play in good faith, then my heart certainly wouldn't be in it. Maybe I'd do a low-effort kind of playstyle, keep myself out of touch with the game so I don't ruin it for others. Now that I'm thinking more deeply, you're right; it would be right of me to disrupt the game, at least not intentionally. But I don't think I'd contribute anything to the collaboration.<br/><br/>But that's just personal opinion. From a designer's standpoint, yes, it'd be nice if everyone played in good faith. That's not guaranteed. I'm not sure exactly what percentage of your playerbase will engage in problem playstyles (I think it might vary from game to game), but considering how little friends people have these days, you can't afford to write those people off.<br/><br/>i forgot how to make line breaks so have these dashes ----------<br/><br/>Wooh! I don't think I can keep up my writing pace. I'm not sure how much deeper this rabbit hole goes, but I'll try and give everyone's points a fair analysis. If I drop off the face of the earth for a few days, know I'm still reading everything.

Well, my single personal experience and handful of anecdotes does not match at all with your speculated failure points.  But we're not you, so I'll take your word for it when you say the execution wouldn't work for you.<br/><br/>If it took you a lot of work to find the relevant info for that determination, then yeah, that's a bummer, and a sort of marketing failure.  I do wish more RPGs made the details of how they work more obvious to customers.<br/><br/>On to another point: I don't think losing potential players, because the designer executed their design the way they wanted to, is any sort of failure.  I don't think I know any RPG designers who just start with a succinct premise and then execute it in any old way that works for their presumed audience.  Many designers are motivated more by execution than by the sort of premise commonly pitched to an audience.  <br/><br/>Supposing Avery wanted to make a game about juggling projects in turns over time in response to problem prompts, then the audience for that was going to be whatever it was going to be, and there certainly would not have been any reason for her to scrap those details in favor of a more accessible village-care game.  In that scenario, the marketing problem is the <i>only</i> problem, in my eyes.<br/><br/>I'm speaking here as a hobbyist rather than as a business person.  If I knew more about how to convert "time spent on games" to "dollars earned", I'm sure I'd have a different perspective.<br/><br/>"Do early-stage work on many games based on personal interest, then work hardest on developing the ones which show the most sales potential," seems to work for some folks.  But not all of us have the combo of usable ideas, devoted time, audience feedback, and understanding of what'll sell, that are necessary for that route.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469116/#Comment_469116" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T02:00:45+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  2:00AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2018 2:03AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to the broader point about play cultures: with respect to some of the core issues raised so far, I think there are two basic options:<br/><br/><b>Event first:</b> People are here to do this particular activity, and so that's the priority.  If they didn't know what they were getting into, or did but don't like it upon trying it, then solutions include (a) them leaving or (b) the group (but especially them) trying to find ways they can engage with what the game does have to offer.  Tweaking the game itself might be possible, but fundamentally changing it is not.<br/><br/><b>People first:</b> Do whatever works for the folks who are here right now, whether that's playing ruthlessly rules-as-written, Rule Zeroing the hell out of every inconvenience, playing a different module, or even playing a different game!  Of course, none of these will fix a lack of agreement about what's fun and worthwhile, so compromises may still be necessary and players may still have to be flexible and "find the fun" as in the "event first" model.<br/><br/>Personally, I lean more "event first" at conventions and more "people first" with ongoing home games.

But I don't think that's a serious problem in the RPG industry.  I'd be hard pressed to name a game that encourages being a jerk.  Except maybe Paranoia, but in a way that's not a problem because the expectation is that everyone will be jerks, unlike a game like LoL where the expectation is, in theory, that people will be good sports.  To play Paranoia in good faith is to be a jerk.<br/><br/>So building games to encourage trust and not-encourage dickery is thoroughly plausible, but I still disagree with the fundamental idea that you can "fix" people's behavior with mechanics.  Even the "If a player does X, kick them out" rules are ineffective here.  People will say "But I WANT to continue playing with Cory!" and will not kick them out, and the game still suffers.  Sure, you can blame the people for that, but that's the point: The rules can't change the people.  You can't make people want to play in good faith except by changing what your game is about. \n<blockquote><br/>As for the character stuff in D&amp;D? You don't need to tell me.

If they did, they could use it, even as loosely coupled as it is.  I suspect very strongly that the reason this stuff isn't tied more tightly to the rules as you suggest is that the designers didn't think D&amp;D players _wanted_ that, and once again: Making a rule that tries to do something your players don't want actually MAKES them into problem players.<br/><br/>I think this ties right back to David's point:  You can't design a game that will magically make people want to play it.  So if you define "Not wanting to play that kind of game" as a problem behavior, then you have written yourself into a corner.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" rel="nofollow">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>(If you're looking to see something similar in action, check out the quirks system in <i><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/3e/gurpslite.pdf" rel="nofollow">GURPS</a></i>.

Players make even emotional investments in systems once they have had enough good experiences with them. That becomes another trigger for potential players: their first reaction to new RPGs will be worse if their previous experience with them has already been quite satisfactory.<br/><br/>Not that people can't try something new from time to time, but using <i>familiar</i> mechanics with a more efficient twist or better focused on a type of experience will definitely get a better selling point for veteran players.<br/><br/>I'm all for the point that every player can be a potential problem player if the group's interests are way too diverse and too many people in the group tend to be strong opinionated against something. One player may hate nonsense while the others are all up for some gonzo play. I've got a player with something akin to a tourette syndrome for adding sexual innuendo whenever the game gets too emotional or dramatic. I've got a newbie that wanted to play power fantasy in our 5e campaign, but ended up with his character killed by the other pc's when he sided with the villains in exchange of power, despite the continuous warnings of the rest of the group. <br/><br/>This all sounds dysfunctional as hell, but I've learned how to deal with it and still help the group and myself to lots of healthy fun. And<i> its all about design</i>. Rewards play a big part on it but not every reward must be game currency. Helping players create things definitely results in players invested on their creations. They may sometimes act like they don't care too much about them but you will always find them later defending their creations in some sense, even if it is just <i>the way they should be destroyed</i>.<br/><br/>Building over other players creation or input becomes the best reward sometimes, even when said input is just splurt specifically to prove the player isn't interested in the game, like saying "yeah, whatever" just to stop being bothered by other players. When said player input is taken seriously and another player starts to build upon it, the change on the other player is amazing: they start to edit themselves, pay more attention and try something more helpful, or even try to take back whatever they said before and do it "better" by their own standards, instead of the perceived group standards. If you ever get to play with an uninterested player, either veteran or a newbie, try this trick and see the results by yourself.<br/><br/>Timing is also really really important. Taking two seconds to make a houserule can make a really big difference from taking even 5 seconds to check the proper rule in the corebook. Small periods of silence in an otherwise fluid game conversation is enough to make people start other conversations or even different activities, and the longer periods of inactivity for a single player become, the more prone that player will be to distractions or even distract other players. This dilutes the fictional world in everyone's head, even the GM, when they start to get anxious to retake the game or even resentful at the rest of the players "for not paying attention" and starting the cycle of introducing "interesting" or plain dangerous things in the story to force the players to pay attention.<br/><br/>But my main point here is that nothing of this is about "fixing" other players. We still play with the guy with the tourette syndrome and the rest. We try and get as much communication as possible at the table, try to keep the game fast and many many other tricks, but we're definitely not trying to<i> fix</i> these guys through design. Rewards work best when used to get the players to do something they already want and like to do, and are terrible to "fix" them or better put, force them into doing the things the designer or other players want them to do. That's something I learned here on SG by the way, even when the idea isn't really new.<br/><br/>What I think design should be about is to help the players remove the nonsense and avoid potential problems, but for that the designer needs to think a lot more on what kind of problems their design will bring. We definitely need more testing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469130/#Comment_469130" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T06:49:58+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  6:49AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a bit late to the party here but I was so surprised to see no one quote from the Quiet Year rule book to refute <a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">@FriendlyAlienLocust</a> 's claims about its design that I have to interject briefly.  A few quotes that you may find helpful:<br/><br/>From the game's introduction:\n<blockquote>"Players work together to create and steer this community, but they also play devil\u2019s advocate and introduce problems and tensions into the game."</blockquote>\nIntroducing the concept of Contempt:\n<blockquote>"<i>Point to the Contempt Tokens.</i>  These are Contempt Tokens.  They represent any tension and frustration that might arise in the community."</blockquote>\nA deeper discussion of the Contempt system:\n<blockquote>"Contempt: If ever you feel like you weren\u2019t consulted or honoured in a decision-making process, you can take a piece of Contempt and place it in front of you.  is is your outlet for expressing disagreement or tension. If someone starts a project that you don\u2019t agree with, you don\u2019t get to voice your objections or speak out of turn. You are instead invited to take a piece of Contempt.<br/>Contempt will generally remain in front of players until the end of the game. It will act as a reminder of past contentions. Its primary role is as a social signifier. In addition, you can discard it back into the centre of the table in two ways: by acting selfishly and by diffusing tensions.<br/>If you ever want to act selfishly, to the known detriment of the community, you can discard a Contempt token to justify your behaviour. You decide whether your behaviour requires justification.  This will often trigger others taking Contempt tokens in response.<br/>If someone else does something that you greatly support, that would mend relationships and rebuild trust, you can discard a Contempt token to demonstrate how they have diffused past tensions."</blockquote>\nNot only does <i>The Quiet Year</i> invite players to introduce story elements that harm the community, individual players are given a mechanical means by which to voice their disagreement with the other players and an ability to act on that disagreement.  Taking Contempt gives you the ability to act selfishly in the game, and also invites other players to attempt reconciliation with you.<br/><br/>I would argue that <i>The Quiet Year</i> is actually a great example of the kinds of mechanics you are calling for in this regard, not the failure you paint it as.<br/><br/>A separate, but related point:\n<blockquote>"Hold a Discussion: ...A discussion never results in a decision or summation process. Everyone weighs in, and then it\u2019s over. This is how conversations work in communities: they are untidy and inconclusive affairs."</blockquote>\nThis speaks to your point about messages in the game.  Messages like this one and the Contempt system are some of the strongest messages inherent in the game system, and they are realistic, applicable messages with plenty of support in history.  You can fret all you like about what messages players may inject into a system that allows them to, but it's a good idea to see what messages are inherent in the system itself before letting those fears close you off to an entire experience.<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing me to revisit this somewhat off-topic point for a moment.  I have feelings about many other points made by many other posters and I've very much enjoyed this conversation, thanks to everyone!  I may weigh in on some more on-topic things at a later time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469132/#Comment_469132" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T09:38:00+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  9:38AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is giving me a headache... because too many topics I'd like to talk about are coming up too fast for me to actually read everything and follow suit (this is also a foreign language to me, you see).

A potentially fruitful one because of issues it raises, but it is currently at a stopping point. Since you are actually attracted by the premise of the game, I do suggest you actually play it sometime (you don't even have to buy the rulebook to do so, actually - just look for someone who has it and is looking for players) and make your best effort at playing it in earnest, not second-guessing yourself. Meanwhile, I do believe you are really ill-equipped to discuss it as of now (no hostility implied - I just believe this is currently distracting us all from other conversations we could be having).<br/><br/>With that out of the way for the moment, I'll be extremely happy to discuss political messages in role-playing games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469141/#Comment_469141" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T13:54:04+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  1:54PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2018 1:56PM by Adam_Dray.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a side note, the 5e Player's Handbook addresses the issue of friendship in its Preface on page 4:<br/><br/>"Playing D&amp;D is an exercise in collaborative creation.

I\u2019m not trying to rain on the parade, but I would say to be careful when discussing anything related to politics. Political discussions are not allowed on the forums so I would personally avoid taking personal positions on them or getting emotionally invested and just focus tightly on the messaging issue. <br/><br/>Some people like to debate and it can come off as combative and I just don\u2019t want a new member to stop coming because a mod had to intercede, and the member interpreted it in the wrong spirit and decided not to come back. I enjoy new voices and perspectives and wouldn\u2019t want to lose one over a misunderstanding. <br/><br/>We are also having a discussion about a forum member\u2019s game. I personally think any criticism should be thoughtful, nuanced and informed to the degree it is possible; in fact, I would actually be interested in peoples\u2019 viewpoint on how to discuss issues one may have with designers\u2019 games in our community, while at the same time making sure the discussions are positive and constructive and not hurtful\u2014it seems like it can be a difficult line to walk. <br/><br/>Anyway, I may be being overly cautious, but I I\u2019m having flashbacks of past threads that became overly antagonist and I\u2019m just hoping it doesn\u2019t go there and the vibe stays good. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469146/#Comment_469146" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T18:15:13+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  6:15PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Rafu:<br/><br/>This conversation contains a dizzying array of topics - politics, messaging, friendship, problem players, etc - any of which would ge challenging on their own.<br/><br/>I'd recommend starting a new thread for each.
