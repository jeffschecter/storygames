Character creation is close to done, and there are a few things I'm wondering about before we finish up the accomplishments and then start off:<br/><br/>For Relationships, how often should someone in a town be a relative of a PC that they haven't assigned dice to? It seems like most or all of them from what I've seen in the book and online, but I could see it being silly if I keep adding new family members for each town. In addition it might be a bit difficult to justify as one PC is from Back East and the other is a Mountain Person who converted.<br/><br/>As the difference between Traits and Relationships is "Traits let you decide how a conflict gets solved, Relationships let you influence what they're about", how often should older Relationships come up? I've never played DitV before, is it common for PCs to head back and check on previous towns?<br/><br/>For a Relationship with another PC, does it being usable when the person comes to your active aid mean just being in the same conflict with them? The player of the Mountain Person Dog wants to have a Relationship with the Dog from Back East, but I'm not sure how often she would be getting the benefit of the dice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395074/#Comment_395074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T12:59:32+00:00" title="October 27, 2012 12:59PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was quite confused about Relationships when I started playing Dogs. One key element is that you do not need to assign relationship dice right away: very often, you're using the dice to create new relationships with people you meet. <br/><br/>And so that's why you get new relationship dice at certain points in the game; so you can keep creating new relationships.<br/><br/>Having relationship dice to another Dog is very useful: you get those dice if the other character is at stake somehow (like if someone is trying to kill them), and also if you're in conflict with them. <br/><br/>In some unusual situations, your relationship with someone can be relevant and/or at stake even if that person isn't present. (One example, not for everyone's taste, but occasionally interesting, is when we establish that a certain conflict might affect someone you care about far away, like a loved one, or perhaps one of the Elders/mentors hearing something about you which affects their relationship to you. In those cases, you could say rolling in the Relationship dice is warranted.)<br/><br/>I think that in a long-term Dogs game, it's extra interesting to return to Towns previously visited or otherwise run into characters you've interacted with before. I haven't heard of too many people returning to old Towns (mostly because it's rare that people actually play out long-term Dogs campaigns), but I think it's a great idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Himalayan_Salt" title="Himalayan_Salt"><img alt="Himalayan_Salt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Himalayan_Salt">Himalayan_Salt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395297/#Comment_395297" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T13:28:52+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  1:28PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2012 2:54PM by Himalayan_Salt.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Having relationship dice to another Dog is very useful: you get those dice if the other character is at stake somehow (like if someone is trying to kill them), and also if you're in conflict with them. <br/><br/>In some unusual situations, your relationship with someone can be relevant and/or at stake even if that person isn't present.

Also, technically, I don't think you're supposed to be able to draw on relationship dice unless the conflict is ABOUT the relationship (though a lot of them are, in one way or another). P.S. You don't need the person to be in the scene for the conflict to be about your relationship with them, but it helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395304/#Comment_395304" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T14:53:43+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  2:53PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always been pretty liberal with how relationships are created and assigned myself, because you really want them to show up.

They have dozens of children in a family.  They're obsessed with genealogy.  They know all their cousins and cousins' cousins and so forth.  Having family in every town you visit is to be expected.
