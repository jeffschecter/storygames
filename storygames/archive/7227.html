I made an open call to friends for some roleplaying, hoping that maybe half would be able to make it. Instead almost everyone could.  I know at least three want to play PTA as the top pick out of the options I gave (and three more are interested), so it's looking likely.<br/><br/>I was thinking this was on the high side after some stories, but the book suggests having a season that closely matches the number of players, so since there's a 9 episode season option, I figure the player number could at least go that high.  Also Firefly has 9 core characters, so it should work story wise.  But we might only be doing a pilot (I'm not sure if all 9 of us will be able to meet regularly).<br/><br/>So, experiences with a lot of people in PTA? How did it go? Any tips on helping it run smoothly?<br/><br/>As an aside, I put 9 in parentheses because one person who can't make it is interested in making it at some future point. I figuring adding him in will be easy, since the first episode will be the pilot, it won't be hard to fill in a gap (well, hopefully) and at least mechanically will work out just fine. But, can you run PTA with inconsistent players? Like I have 8 this time, 7 the next, 9 after that, 6 for episode 3, etc....                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160782/#Comment_160782" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T10:18:20+00:00" title="August  5, 2008 10:18AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd divide into two groups.

I know disinviting people is an option and see if another day works for them, but I'm looking for alternatives.<br/><br/>If PTA can't handle 8, why does the 9 season structure imply 9 is optimal? Or more constructively, what are the specific problems that make 8 or more players too many?  <br/><br/>I mean, the way I see it is that you might have a show like The Wire (judging from the first few episodes of 1st season) where there are two "groups" in the story, mostly separate from each other, with a few characters that come into contact every once in a while crossing the boundries. So you might have scenes with 1-4 characters at a time, the pressure really being on those players, while the other half gets to throw in comments, fan mail, cards (with possible narration winning), look for potential hooks, and enjoy being the audience (which knowing my friends will work well for most of them). Scene framing would jump between the two groups. So, there's more time where players aren't under pressure to perform, which might be a good thing since half the group is new to the whole roleplaying thing, and only two players have the improv practice (from story games and/or acting) that would let them slide into the narration control PTA asks for, at least judging from past experience.<br/><br/>So, are there any specific problems? Mechanically? Socially? Something else?  Tell me the problems you've encountered that puts you squarely in the "divide" camp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160800/#Comment_160800" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T11:41:19+00:00" title="August  5, 2008 11:41AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played a game of PTA with so many players, but I do have some thoughts:<br/><br/>1. Be careful. The conflict resolution mechanic could get messy in situation involving more than 2 or 3 characters. (Maybe there's a trick to it, though?)<br/><br/>2. You could make a large group PTA game more fun for everyone by creating a fairly limited setting. Take an isolated location like a shipwreck on an island or a small space station, and populate it only sparsely (if at all). With the majority of the people existing in your setting being PCs, any scene you come up with will involve multiple players and be relevant enough to everyone else to keep them interested. Contrast that with a story spread out over several continents, where one character's actions could hardly affect or concern any other PCs!<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160815/#Comment_160815" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T12:27:37+00:00" title="August  5, 2008 12:27PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should go ask Matt Wilson.

(We came up with "Funkula", a show about a nine-piece funk band that fights vampires.)<br/><br/>It ran just fine with nine players. Granted, one player was pretty tired, so he wasn't able to contribute much. (Ever a danger with convention games.) Everyone else contributed about in-line with their screen presence for the episode. The 1s mostly observed and pitched in from time-to-time, the 2s did a moderate amount of roleplaying and contributing, and our spotlight player was<i> on fire</i>.<br/><br/>So I'd say, go ahead and try it. Just makes sure that 1.) you pitch a show that can handle a large ensemble cast, and 2.) you skip the pilot. With a large group, you need strong screen presence roles right away, so that each player knows how much they're expected to contribute in any given episode.<br/><br/>And remember that PTA has "audience participation" rules in the back, so that people without characters can contribute to the game. If someone knows that they won't make it to most games, you can see if they would prefer an "audience" role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161217/#Comment_161217" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T12:02:49+00:00" title="August  7, 2008 12:02PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the AP, morgue! <br/><br/>Good to know 9 is a workable number too, since that was the number I invited.
