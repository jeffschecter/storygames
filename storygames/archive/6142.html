It might not be our cuppa, and that's fine, but I want to make sure I totally and completely understand the intent of the rules before I make that decision.<br/><br/>Item the first:<br/><br/>Okay, so you start out with your scores, your traits, a past and present, and your Devil. (My guys all went 3 (!) on their Devils, which turns out was probably a super-bad idea for newbies.) You get into some conflicts. It appears to me that each conflict is, ultimately, an opportunity to earn chips, mostly via opposing one's own traits and Devil; we started at 0, so the chip economy started poorly lubricated.<br/><br/>The players pretty much absolutely refused to earn chips. Their value is almost totally opaque early on, since they didn't know how they'd work in The End (see item <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> below). Besides not really seeing the value of chips, they were also terrified of giving up 1 (for a trait) or 3 (for their overjuiced Devil) or 4 (for both!) cards, because Harm hurts so, so much. As the Dealer, I also whipped out some extraordinary hands -- three Full Houses, a couple straights, a flush. The players got their asses statistically kicked, resulting in a death-spiral of ever-decreasing-effectiveness inside the game.<br/><br/>So my question is this: Is this how Harm is supposed to impact the game? I'm getting that your scores act as a countdown toward The End, but it seems like Harm also accelerates the effect. True?<br/><br/>Item the second:<br/><br/>Is the point of a session of Dust Devils to drive your character toward The End?<br/><br/>After our session, I was strongly reminded of the play pace in InSpectres: you can't finish the mission 'til you've earned enough job dice, right? It seems like you can't really finish a session of Dust Devils 'til you've reached The End.<br/><br/>My impression of the overall flow of play is this:<br/><br/>1) Get into a conflict<br/><br/>2) Go against your traits and Devil to earn a couple chips, courting Harm. If you start with 0 chips, there's nothing to Stake. If you start with &gt;0 chips, then you need all the cards you can get to double your bet.<br/><br/>(Rules question: At what point in a conflict can you bet Stakes? Can you wait 'til after the Draw?)<br/><br/>3) As you enter more conflicts, eventually start gaining Harm<br/><br/>4) Get into new conflicts, but with even fewer cards (thus beginning the death spiral)<br/><br/>5) Keep earning chips, even in the face of decreased character effectiveness. Also, as effectiveness decreases, betting Stakes becomes untenable.<br/><br/>6) Enter The End<br/><br/>7a) Hopefully armed with a fuckload of chips, narrate your final scene on your own terms, or <br/><br/>7b) Left with nothing but your Devil and probably few-or-no chips, narrate a spectacular failure.<br/><br/>I think if we knew the "point" of a session was to harvest chips for The End, things would have played out a bit differently.<br/><br/>That said, if the point of a session really is to aim for The End, why the discussion in the book about playing for multiple sessions? The thing about giving out 3-4 chips if you're going to play a single-session game is almost a throwaway comment, where it seems like that should almost be mandated. <br/><br/>Side question: What does a session of DD look like when nobody has reached The End?<br/><br/>And that's about it for now. I'm sure more discussion will come up as I start reading answers.<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137870/#Comment_137870" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:24:53+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, wow, five days, an April Fool's prank and a convention seems to have pushed this out of view. :-(<br/><br/>I had a chance to read the Chimera board over @ the Forge, and that was enlightening. I also had a chance to go mano-a-mano this week and that really helped hammer stuff out for me. So let's say my first post's issues have resolved themselves. I have a couple more questions. Can someone help? <br/><br/>First:<br/><br/>Given that you can always fold if you have a chip (although, yes, folding leaves the situation unresolved), and you can always earn two chips by denying your Trait and your Devil, is there anything other than social contract to keep players from simply netting +1 chip by drawing and immediately folding, over and over again? I mean, if it happened more than a couple times (I've got one player who might pull this, just to prove a point), I'm sure I could stop the action, ask him if he thinks he or I or anyone else at the table is having fun because this, and move on. I'm just wondering if there's some other mechanism at work to keep that from happening.<br/><br/>Followup to the first:<br/><br/>Assuming there's no mechanical incentive to not simply earn +1 chips for an unspecified number of draws, is it the intent of the rules that players go ahead and do this 'til they feel they've drawn a killer hand? What happens if the Dealer pulls the same stunt? Any guidelines on ratcheting up the conflict in-game to reflect these false starts?<br/><br/>Second:<br/><br/>I'm having trouble getting in my head that your character probably won't get to directly take down his enemy before he reaches The End. Here's what I mean: <br/><br/>If you've set up a situation wherein you have set up your opponent to be at The End, but you are not, then it's just a matter of beating his hand and seeing what he does with his last scene (unless you buy the scene from him). No problem.<br/><br/>If you've entered The End but your opponent has not, then you can cash out your chips and blow out his Scores. Cool, except your opponent is not at The End yet (since when he drew, he had non-0 Scores). So the best you can do is set him up for someone else to take down. This feels unsatisfying, although I suppose you could negotiate a side deal to Redeem someone if in turn they go finish your unfinished business. Is that the idea?<br/><br/>If both you and your opponent enter The End at the same time, you have nothing to do with your big pile of chips. Harm to your opponent is irrelevant since this is his last scene anyway. That leaves you inflicting Harm and Redemption on other characters in the game. I'm having trouble squaring this up. It feels...passive-aggressive, maybe? Scratch that. I "get" Redemption -- brilliant mechanic, cool idea. What I'm not getting is the inability to Harm the guy you're up against when you're both at The End. Again, at first blush it feels unsatisfying.<br/><br/>So, there I am. Help me get my head screwed on straight!<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137905/#Comment_137905" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T11:04:23+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 11:04AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It did indeed push it out of view, Paul.

I really love it when people play my games. Lots of your questions seem to be about the game in a more abstract way, like interpreting the text this way or  that. And, that's cool. I'd also like to hear more about what happened in your game if you'd care to share. Anyway, on to some questions and comments...<br/>\n<blockquote>Given that you can always fold if you have a chip (although, yes, folding leaves the situation unresolved), and you can always earn two chips by denying your Trait and your Devil, is there anything other than social contract to keep players from simply netting +1 chip by drawing and immediately folding, over and over again? I mean, if it happened more than a couple times (I've got one player who might pull this, just to prove a point), I'm sure I could stop the action, ask him if he thinks he or I or anyone else at the table is having fun because this, and move on. I'm just wondering if there's some other mechanism at work to keep that from happening.</blockquote>\nNo, no such mechanism (although awarding a Chip for countering the Devil is the Dealer's prerogative.) And, of course. You could do that. But, why the heck would you want to do that? <br/><br/>What does folding/chipping in over and over again look like in the game? What's going on? Does it say something about your character? If not, why are you doing it? I'm much, much more interested in those questions than satisfying someone behaving in a way to prove a point about mechanics. It's never happened in play as far as I'm aware. <br/><br/>BUT! I could see it happening functionally in the context of a story. You know those Westerns where the hero is a total washed up schmuck who lets people walk all over him until he finally goes crazy and kills every bad guy in town? Heck, Unforgiven is this way to some degree. Yeah, those chips and The End could be pretty awesome.\n<blockquote>If you've entered The End but your opponent has not, then you can cash out your chips and blow out his Scores. Cool, except your opponent is not at The End yet (since when he drew, he had non-0 Scores). So the best you can do is set him up for someone else to take down. This feels unsatisfying, although I suppose you could negotiate a side deal to Redeem someone if in turn they go finish your unfinished business. Is that the idea?</blockquote>\nYes, that's the idea. You say it seems unsatisfying, and I think I see what you're saying. That's cool. I find it one of the coolest damn parts of the game, but it happens too rarely for my tastes! The example in the book -- Gentleman Jim sending Luke the rest of his money as a bounty-from-the-grave to kill Kerrigan. AWESOME.\n<blockquote>If both you and your opponent enter The End at the same time, you have nothing to do with your big pile of chips. Harm to your opponent is irrelevant since this is his last scene anyway. That leaves you inflicting Harm and Redemption on other characters in the game. I'm having trouble squaring this up.

What I'm not getting is the inability to Harm the guy you're up against when you're both at The End. Again, at first blush it feels unsatisfying.</blockquote>\nSo, did you do that and was it unsatisfying? I've played many game with Chips left "on the table." Didn't strike me as really disatifying. But, you may find otherwise. You're correct that facing off against your rival while both of you are at The End is unsastifying <i>assuming you want to use Chips to inflict Harm.</i> There no answer for that situation -- I shoot him, he shoots me. The End. Neat. Maybe slightly inelegant, but ok. (Oh, and the reason I don't find it particulary unsatisfying is that we've reached the resolution I'm after; Harm was the means, not the end. Narrate more pain and suffering for that no good rival! It needn't be mechanical, and needn't be actual "Harm" as in the game term.)<br/><br/>Also, consider these other options: <br/><br/>Harm his friends/family, too. <br/>Redeem him! Save his life and see how that settles him!<br/>Redeem his friend/family, and narrate it that you turn them against him as he dies!<br/>Harm anyone who gets in the way of you exacting your revenge. Send a nasty message!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138040/#Comment_138040" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T19:08:26+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  7:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe that's what I could use: What's folding supposed to look like inside the game fiction? It's not purely a game mechanism, obviously. So what is it? That's why I mentioned that, presumably, folding can mean some sort of change or escalation of the issue at hand. I need to think on that some more.<br/><br/>I'm bringing up this subject mostly to pre-empt the inevitable conversation I'm going to have with one of my players tomorrow. He just twigged to the whole "get two chips, fold, and net a chip" math and I want to make sure he sees that folding = something happened, even if the conflict wasn't resolved.<br/><br/>In AP, I've only had to work out one fold so far. Basically it was a social power play between a gang tough (the NPC) and his hired gun (the PC). The hired gun folded, meaning the question of who was <i>mas macho</i> remained unanswered. And, sure enough, the game-fiction conflict escalated a bit 'til the guns came out. So, yeah, maybe this takes care of itself.<br/><br/>Re. The End and unsatisfying outcomes. Okay, I've had two sessions of DD so far (one solo, one group). In the solo game, the player decided he wanted/needed to reach The End mostly because he was out of time and needed to go home. In that case, he had 17 chips (!!!) when he reached The End. His sworn enemy had taken some damage but wasn't at The End yet. So our hero gets into his final kerfuffle, draws a pretty good hand, and just nukes the rest of his enemy's scores. And then he's dead, and his enemy's zeroed out with nobody to finish the job (nor to redeem him). It was...ambiguous. Did the player "win"? <br/><br/>In the group game, one of the players reached The End with 2 chips. We had started with 0, and sure enough, it's a tough slog to get the chip economy going. Same thing happened to this guy: he loses on the final draw and dishes out 2 Harm to the NPC who takes him down. Very anticlimactic. Then again, he was a racist asshole who continued being racist throughout the story (Devil 3, never took a chip because he couldn't afford to lose the cards), and died. Again, really ambiguous.<br/><br/>All that said, we're going for it again tomorrow. I think I've got my head wrapped around folding, and I'm prepared to see what the players do with reaching The End when they know they can't deliver the killing blow to their enemy. After all, killing your enemy means you "win", right? ;-)<br/><br/>Thanks for getting back to me,<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138083/#Comment_138083" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T05:39:25+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  5:39AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, winning in the Dust Devils is creating a meaningful, resolved story.

For example, the racist jerk dying with a whimper not a bang? I don't see that as "losing" at all. The audience (that is, the players) get something out of it, as I see it. <br/><br/>It's a game about violence (both inflicting violence and receiving violence) and how you deal with that.

The B crowd may be more receptive.<br/><br/>Biggest gripe is that Harm is so, so fast. The negative impact on their authorship ramps up so fast that they were avoiding conflicts at all costs, which they feel is the wrong behavior to incentivize. Worst behavior of the night was, as I suspected/feared, basically elbowing their way into a conflict only to immediately fold and net their +1 chip. Since they can't take Harm, all I can do is change the context of the conflict a bit. I can ratchet it up narratively, but Harm is still Harm, and it's not like they're going to take any <i>more</i> harm based on the context of the conflict.<br/><br/>So, for the bulk of my group, the flow of play was to 1) Identify that the punishment for losing conflicts is far greater than the reward for winning them, 2) Entering conflicts with no intention of actually completing them, 3) Netting +1 chip and immediately folding. They get a chip and they don't suffer Harm. Teh Win! \\o/<br/><br/>My players found that playing toward or against their Devil was simply not interesting; every decision came down to an analysis of resources, with absolutely no emotional investment in the flow of events or narrative outcomes. This should have been the loudest alarm: If they don't click with the fundamental question of the game, they're not going to get anything out of it. <br/><br/>Ah, well. They can't all be winners. :-/<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138306/#Comment_138306" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T08:27:53+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  8:27AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the people, some of the time ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138314/#Comment_138314" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T10:15:55+00:00" title="April  5, 2008 10:15AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone run the math on the distribution of Harm versus average hand sizes? That'd be verrrry interesting.<br/><br/>Totally anecdotal here, but in three sessions of DD, I found the average total card draw is 11 cards (7 from scores, a trait, Devil 2, and a relevant past/present) and the average play is a Straight or Full House, i.e. Harm 4. I think we had a single Harm 3 conflict, otherwise it was <i>always</i> 4 Harm. That's a lot of risk for a single conflict! As GM, I basically went 50/50 on whether my NPCs were giving in to their Devils or working against them. Pacing felt correct, and as many NPCs as PCs entered The End.<br/><br/>Granted, there's probably a disconnect on my players' part as to what the stats represent. But the net result is that an average single loss effectively cuts down their character's authorship power by a third, and accelerates future losses because of the reduced card draw. After a single loss, assuming you're drawing against damaged Scores, the average draw goes down to 8ish. Also, the winners get richer, faster: not only are they not losing cards, by drawing against the PCs' smaller hand sizes they can afford to earn more chips (and bet more!) in future conflicts. If the PCs spend their chips to heal damaged scores, which one of them did last night, it is really hard to dig themselves out of the hole (and the bad guys with lots of chips aren't having to spend them recovering!) -- there's nothing to Stake.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I'd change this. Dialing down Harm across the board would just slow the game down, probably, although it'd make Recovery scenes more viable since the odds of zeroing out a Score would be reduced. The "high action" rules from Deathwish seem promising, making the "how many chips can I earn without zeroing out?" dynamic more a game of chicken.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some mathy thinking about this stuff. I don't know that it addresses the fundamental thematic disconnect with my players, but it would give them a bit more breathing room.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
