We had boxes and boxes and boxes of them. We loved gathering themed collections, adding more and more toys as sets were released and new toys replaced outdated ones. And we loved creating our own stories with them.<br/><br/>One of or favorite collections was the Western set, with several town buildings (the sheriff's, the saloon, the blacksmith's...), a Ranch (complete with cowboys, lots of cows and stuff) the Fort (complete with cavalry soldiers) and even a big Indian village.<br/><br/>One of our neighborhood friends was deep into these toys too, so at some point we started playing big. We'd invite him to sleep over on Saturday. Our parents would put a big carpet all over the (empty) living room, and we'll start our little gaming "ritual".<br/><br/>First of all, each one of us would pick a "team" (the town, the Indians and the Fort+Ranch). Then, the first couple of hours we'd build a room-size model, separating the "zones" with improvised rivers, trees, rock formations (mainly wooden boxes covered by brown blankets and stuff like that) and whatever we fancied at the moment.<br/><br/>Then we'd start "playing". Playing all by yourself with your "team" was boring, so soon we'd start interacting.<br/><br/>The Indians would attack the town by night, and the cavalry would try to save them. Or the Ranch would suffer from some sort of disaster, and they'd ask for help. Or the pretty Indian girl would fall in love with the Cowboy Kid (complete with "forbidden love" drama and stuff). And specially we'd start trying to create an economy, negotiating selling and buying goods.<br/><br/>At some point we got a "gambusinos" set. Gold prospectors, with the requires equipment. Always placed near the river, of course. And those yellow little sacks the prospectors set came with were allegedly full of gold, so we'd use that as our currency.<br/><br/>As the night progressed, we'd start getting "gold crazed", and we'd start competing to see who could get more gold. By the end of it, the gold sacks would be too few for us, and we'd start considering any yellow toy piece or accessory as Gold. Most of the time things did not end well (in the good sense ^_^). Many times, open warfare was a given (with surprising results, as many times the town and the Indians would ally against the cavalry, or stuff like that).<br/><br/>And by then it would be about 3 or 4 am, and we'd be wasted. Then we'd go to sleep, and wake up late the next morning. Ready for one more try.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.collectobil.com/images/items/3733.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304379/#Comment_304379" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T11:08:27+00:00" title="December 14, 2010 11:08AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Tristan, that's the sort of thing I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/glazer" title="glazer"><img alt="glazer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/glazer">glazer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304403/#Comment_304403" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T13:03:51+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  1:03PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have suitable reminiscences of my own (I was into action toys, Airfix toy soldiers and wargames kind of stuff right from the start, sadly), but Tristran's comments reminded me of Floor Games by H G Wells.

But they are not static. And I mean it like "you can do all sort of stuff with them", not in the "have movable parts" sense. You can combine, mix, personalize and simulate all sort of things with them. But there is a limit (and the fun part is pushing to see how far you can take that limit).<br/><br/>Say I have this playmobile figure. And I can make it wear all kind of hats. (Among those I actually possess, that is.) So I can put him this astronaut hat and say he is a scuba diver, or an alien, or a Biohazard guy... But it is still a hat. An astronaut hat, that is. And what about vests and stuff?...<br/><br/>You know what I mean? It ignites the imagination, because there are "endless possibilities", yet you have a limited amount of "starting pieces" to begin with. (Pretty much the same as in any RPG, actually.) And that begs for creating all sort of stories, themes and "games".<br/><br/>And you know that is the funnest part of it all? By the end of the day, you take the hat off, store the toy in its box and "forget" about what you played today. And tomorrow you can go back, pick a different hat and we'll have a completely different, new and exciting toy, full with a new story, theme or "game" to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304431/#Comment_304431" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T15:22:44+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  3:22PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2010 3:24PM by komradebob.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've begun to suspect that D&amp;D in the "Fad/Craze" period is better understood as a toy than a game.<br/><br/>Much of what you've just said fits neatly with that concept, Tristan.<br/><br/>Did things always totally reset after a night/session of play?

We played with rocks and sticks and clods of dirt. We named the games things like 'Rock Wars' or 'Don't Get Hit.' <br/><br/>Our proto-roleplaying game was called 'Vietnam.' It was based on what we barely knew about anything along with a couple of episodes of Tour of Duty we'd managed to catch on TV. We would wander around the woods near our house (with sticks as guns) with a squad of imaginary privates until the Viet Cong ambushed us, and all the privates but us got shot and we managed to survive by shooting our way out. Once we watched Red Dawn, though, it was Russians with no looking back.<br/><br/>Sometime while still in my early days of playing pretend we learned about a game called Dungeons &amp; Dragons. You were a warrior and you fought skeletons and goblins and you could do anything you wanted! But we couldn't play it because our mother thought we would kill ourselves, so we ran around the woods with sticks as swords fighting pretend goblins and skeletons and dragons. We invented LARPing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304440/#Comment_304440" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T15:41:06+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  3:41PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Did things always totally reset after a night/session of play?

The town was (literally) upside down, the geography had exploded, we got tired of the characters and themes pretty fast...<br/><br/>From once in a while, though, some elements carried over from game to game. Mostly meta-stuff ("the yellow thingies are gold, thus valuable"), but some thematic stuff as well (we had a recurring alliance between the townspeople and the Indians against the cavalry soldiers by the end of the night, even while the "teams" got played by different players on different occasions).<br/><br/>I think we did a sort of sequel once. "My grandfather was the one that made the truce between our people possible, all those years ago, you know?

We used wooden blocks, Fisher Price doll house and accessories (plus people - they were about the same size), accessories from various things (including G.I. Joe), and various other bits. All the characters were recurring. Play with them overlapped my getting into RPGs by a year or so (probably stopped when I started to play every weekend at MIT).

I can only remember one (one!) instance where I played with a friend, moving little figures around a Sesame Street playset I had, but that was a very rare exception.  My siblings were older and interested in other things, and when I played with friends we usually did more physical stuff, outside; this was how I'd play indoors by myself.<br/><br/>A lot of what I was doing was enacting little movies/plays/stories.  Here we are on Hoth, and Han Solo is defending the Alliance base from the forces of Darth Vader...until the Imperial Officer gets the drop on him, and now he has to figure out how to make his escape.  Or here's a cop in his cool sportscar chasing down the bad guy (also in a cool sportscar) through the most hellishly twisted set of interlocking highways imaginable, and both of them are doing awesome stunts in slow motion and crashing through obstacles.  Or here are a small band of army men evacuating by helicopter from a remote location (the coffee table) back to their base (the top of the stairs), only some of them will have to stay behind...who will it be?  What will the crew of the boat looking for sunken treasure do when they capsize and the evil plastic shark moves in?  (The answer to that last one was "Get eaten," mostly.  The shark always won.)<br/><br/>Fighting was sometimes the focus, but exploration was also a big thing in those stories:  my action figures were always going to weird places and setting up little camps (complete with cots made out of matchboxes and foam, or winter coats made out of Kleenex, or tools made out of paperclips and toothpicks).  Dramatic confrontations between arch-enemies happened a lot, but were like old Western movies or comic books: lots of talking and pointing weapons, and the shooting is pretty much the end of the story.  Sometimes I'd come up with what amounted to fanfiction: what happened between the end of Star Wars and the beginning of Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>I was very big on dialogue, coming up with lines for each character.  Also, blocking:  I would lay down on my stomach and look at the scene from different angles, figuring out what looked best.  I'd also play with the lights: I'd move lamps around, or use a flashlight and colored cellophane, stuff like that.  A lot of what I was doing was trying to translate my mental image of a story I was telling to myself into a real, physical thing.  Moviemaking, I guess, only without any film and with no other audience.  And without a set script:  I don't think I cared much for re-enacting something I'd already done (although I would come back to particularly good setups or "camera angles" often), I was usually trying out a different story each time I played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304476/#Comment_304476" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T20:12:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  8:12PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>Play with them overlapped my getting into RPGs by a year or so (probably stopped when I started to play every weekend at MIT).

In a way they acted as a sort of action figure, with the presumption that there were imaginary people in the little cars but the only relevant action was what happened while in those cars.<br/><br/>I also did a lot of play pretend with my little sister when we were both very young (I'm her senior by four years). In the last memory I can recall of us playing together like that (not playing an actual game, boardgame, cards, etc.) we were pretending to be pirates. There were bunk beds in my room and our ship was the top bunk. The floor of the room was the ocean, infested with sharks, sea monsters and stuff. At some point one of our invisible pretend pirate mates fell overboard. I was looking over the railing deciding whether to mount a rescue or leave him to the sea monsters when I felt two tiny hands on my back. The next thing I knew I was face down on the (hard) floor. Betrayal! That was the start of the Great War between brother and sister I think, which lasted until we were both adults.<br/><br/>A friend and I would play Tron Deadly Discs with crushed soda cans. We would mark out two "platforms" in the back yard with sticks and whatever else was at hand then chuck these ragged and pointed discs of crushed aluminum at each other. You lost a point if you got hit or if you left your platform while trying to dodge.<br/><br/>The various props that can solidify our imaginings are really pretty funny. A towel around your neck and *bamf* you're a superhero. Underoos helped but weren't strictly necessary. A feather you found in the yard stuck behind your ear and suddenly your a native warrior or princess. A greek sailor's cap and a pair of mirrored aviators can serve as a policeman's outfit. As soon as you're out of site of your parents you transform into great explorers.

Not with the goal of re-enacting them in the actual game, but because it's:  1.) fun solo play I can do quietly indoors, 2.) good for firing up my imagination, and 3.) it lets me develop useful setups/"camera angles"/elements I can throw into my mental toolbox and pull out at opportune moments during the game.  Really, the only difference is that I don't use actual physical toys anymore (because I can work faster without 'em).  Envisioning all kinds of different scenes spinning out of the same basic setup also keeps me from getting stuck on one particular idea: it's great for keeping an open mind and being flexible about my goals during the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304651/#Comment_304651" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T14:38:26+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  2:38PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2010 2:44PM by Tristan.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first times it was a lot of chaos, since we had no procedures and stuff. After a few times, we started learning the best way was to do it organically, thinking ahead and prioritizing gaming potential.<br/><br/>First you set up the terrain. You had to think ahead, so interesting stuff could get to be in there. This is the desert, so it's not so easy to go from one place to the other. In here we have rock formations, so the bandits have a place to hide. In here the river. We need a fertile zone for the ranch and town... (It helped we had prior knowledge about what figures and buildings we had and would use during play.)<br/><br/>Then we'd pick teams. I want to be the indians tonight. Then I'd be the town. I'm the cavalry, but since that is one (big) building and you have several, the ranch is mine too. But then the diligence is mine. Ok, but only if the indians have most of the horses at first. It was heavy on negotiations and bargains. And we used to learn from experience. (So the fort+ranch was a given afterwards.)<br/><br/>Then we'd set the starting positions. We had this sign toy we loved, so we'd place it by the center of the room, and set the zones where the sign pointed. "Fort Don't remember-the-name that way", so that way we place the fort. "Ranch whatever that other way", so the Ranch was that other way. Then we'd use our common sense to place everything else. Consistency and future potential were king. The Indian village needs to be near the river, since they have the canoes. The Fort should be close to the rock formations, and between the Indians and the Town... Once this phase was over, you were not allowed to move any building anymore.<br/><br/>Then we'd start "costuming and customizing" the figures. Most of the time we established "important facts", such as "this guy is the Indian Chief", "This guy is the best gunslinger in town" and stuff like that. Advise and comments were welcomed, but not very common. It was more "state what I want so others know about it". It was an interesting sort of lonely play. (I think in a similar vein to "chargen" in most games.)<br/><br/>After everyone was ready, we'd begin play. It was a sort of non-spoken rule that no one was allowed to start early (even while the first minutes of play would mostly be parallel solo play). "Ok, everyone ready? Go!!!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304926/#Comment_304926" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T19:36:07+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  7:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tristan's descriptions sound like some stuff I would do with my friends around ages 9-11. I got very interested in the idea of trading and economics without actually understanding how they worked. I think a big part of it was that I got bored with the default goal of games being killing the other guys, and I wanted another reason to have little regions with different characteristics that your guys would go to and interact in. I discovered D&amp;D and miniature games pretty shortly after that, and having actual rules suddenly made killing the other guys interesting again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
