GNS was the sign of a big step forward, but I can't find a basic analysis of RPGs there, it's the tip of an iceberg that was the state of affairs 20 years ago. But now all these terms are just more confusing than they were then. We can pile up examples of that but I don't intend to make this thread a junkyard. <br/>Refreshing the basics is always nice, and sometimes necessary. So here is a more general source on games I found useful :<br/><a href="http://www.gamesprecipice.com/category/dimensions/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamesprecipice.com/category/dimensions/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468384/#Comment_468384" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-11T10:20:59+00:00" title="December 11, 2017 10:20AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2017 10:37AM by Rickard.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you want me to drop tons of links? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Here is a collection of my most valued game design resources.

I feel it\u2019s the best complete picture of RPGs generally that we have, but my point is simply that if your trying to do something in a specific design space you really have to dig, play, and read to educate yourself enough about it to be super aware of what you are doing when you design, and even what the options are and where the space can grow...it\u2019s a practice and it takes time and is not purely an intellectual pursuit, and you\u2019ve gotta get down in the trenches and get dirty...I personally think that GNS is insightful but I can see how it can be frustrating for some because there has been a lot of drift in definitions...I personally think that people can be way too critical and dismissive of Ron\u2019s ideas...I also found that sometimes people will just apply his ideas to the limited types of RPGs they are familiar with and think they understand what he\u2019s talking about when they don\u2019t; they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know, and they don\u2019t have the background and context needed to appreciate many indie ideas and innovations\u2014although, to be clear, I\u2019m not saying that this is the case with DeReel. That said, I have ran into this a lot  when I\u2019ve tried to demonstrate the value of these ideas to people whose exposure, background, and understanding of RPG\u2019s is basically confined to the mainstream stuff. Anyway, I hope I answered your question, if not let me know and I\u2019ll give it another shot.

The bit that I have especially gotten a lot of mileage from is to truly understand the nature and purpose of the "Shared Imagined Space"; once I understand how that actually works and what special considerations it brings to roleplaying, I basically have a firm handle on what truly distinguishes the form from other things like board games, theater, literature and other things. That's been of great help in figuring out what roleplaying actually can do, and how.<br/><br/>Again, not trying to push Forgite theory on anybody here. It just struck me that you both only referred to the GNS theory here despite it being somewhat ancillary when it comes to fundamental dynamic-system descriptive modeling of roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468605/#Comment_468605" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-24T04:31:38+00:00" title="December 24, 2017  4:31AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2017 6:17AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve read 100% of the Big Model stuff.

I mean, there was a theoretical scene before the GNS and the Big Model, and the scene continues, albeit in a different form, to this day. Just to name a particular example, we have Markus Montola, who argues that roleplaying is a state of mind, and not something lying in the ludic aspects of the game. In this manner, the game is made in order to create the right psychical state, with the system playing a lesser role. In other words, and this is what I'm trying to say, there are other models, which are useful not less useful. The thing is, though, that there is a need to read them, if you want to see what they have to offer. Most of them don't span as many words as Edwards' articles, but they do last an hour's read (and who knows how much of implementation) for the one. While it does sound discouraging, I do think that it is worth it, and I will gladly suggest articles, if you'll be so kind as to suggest a what you are exactly looking for in such a model. :-)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468617/#Comment_468617" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-25T22:14:43+00:00" title="December 25, 2017 10:14PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 25, 2017 11:31PM by DeReel.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you. Note that I am not asking for anything.<br/>But as you ask : I am looking for a corpus I can read, in the light of which I can analyze my game and see if there is anything lacking in it, or if some things I knew by way of intuition have already been identified as concepts, first for the simplification of my game, second for its improvement. I have found things like that in articles (Rickard's, rgrassi's, the "fun now manifesto", GNS - Big Model). I even found some things in TV Tropes, but really the place is a mess.<br/>Have now read Montola's invisible rules and some more. Found mainly confirmation, which is nice, notably the distinction between game and play, and some assertions about creativity.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thai" title="Thai"><img alt="Thai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thai">Thai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468618/#Comment_468618" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-26T12:22:30+00:00" title="December 26, 2017 12:22PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, sorry about that, my mistake.<br/>I must confess that your criterion is quite wide, for me: it's like answering to the question "why do you walk" with the answer "because I want to get from place to place". It's a perfect answer, of course, although it doesn't answer the implied question of why do you walk and not take a car.<br/>Saying that, I find the Process Model of Roleplaying fascinating, as a nice little intro. It basically argues that the game is made of processes, and those processes interact with each other and create many a thing. The main question, consequently, is how those interactions influence the game, and how do they create the right experience.<br/>\tAnother nice model, for starters, is the channel theory, which, although not completed, tries to typify and to identify styles of roleplaying to a degree that I've never seen anyone else trying to achieve. While the writer's name eludes me, right now, what he basically does is to argue that games are made of different channels, that can be switched on and off, and that include the parts that make the game, from system and meta-elements to action and in-game elements.<br/>\tA favourite of mine, although not a model per se, is the collection of works of the Jeepform movement. What is truly fascinating, in addition to the manifesto and techniques list of a completely different gaming culture, is that one can find on their site complete games that show those ideas in action. Doubt, for once, and Robin's Friends, for the other, are great starting points.<br/>All of these suggestions changed the way I game, so I'm pretty sure that it does have some merit and does suggest some curious aspects.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468623/#Comment_468623" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-26T22:35:58+00:00" title="December 26, 2017 10:35PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will read.
