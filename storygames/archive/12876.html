Whiffing, nonsensical results, result not mattering, slowing things to a crawl (this can depend on the game), swordsman noob (this is whiffing again, just skinned differently), etc. The ones that stand out are:<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; I never want dice to tell me that my character feels or thinks or does something other than what I want my character to feel or think or do.<br/><br/>This might vary from person to person. I love controlling my character, but I do like from time to time to be surprised, not by only what they DO (holy crap, I succeeded at that difficult thing/I failed at that easy thing), but by how they feel and the like. Makes for interesting RP challenges IMO. With moderation, of course.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; I never want dice to break an interesting tactical encounter turning it into a cakewalk or a slaughter.<br/>&gt;&gt; I never want dice to make fearsome characters less impressive since they will eventually hit a string of bad luck and lose a fight they would normally easily win.<br/><br/>Both these are kind of the same, but I actually love these... as long as the system sucks such that they happen *all the time*. When they happen rarely, that's the kind of epic stuff that "table tales" are made of.<br/><br/>Judd has a memorable story of his samurai in L5R, in the first adventure (first encounter?) getting some bum dice rolls, and *brutally dying in the first combat*. That event (once he made up a new character) actually became a central event in the ongoing campaign IIRC.<br/><br/>But again, that was a very memorable one-time result, not "this random crap happens all the time in the system".<br/><br/>But all the other things you list can be chocked to Bad GM Decisions. I know, I've made them all at some point or other, some even recently! And I have of course been on the other side of it as a player as well.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289899/#Comment_289899" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T11:27:22+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:27AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with all your individual points and yet...<br/><br/>I ran a game of Lady Blackbird, and none of your problems came up.  In fact, the players never missed a roll once - and the one time they missed, they used a secret to redo.  Thinking about it later, it was possibly the best session I've GM'd of any game ever.  (Even if I did complain about the Keys in another thread, that complaint was fairly theoretical - we had an awesome session and any problems were niggling.) <br/><br/>Then, next week, I ran a game of the Pool, where the players were whiffing endlessly.  The Pool is brutal.  A zillion other variables also changed, sure, but that's something that really stuck out to me.<br/><br/>And so I'm wondering if part of the magic of LB is that although you might fail, you probably won't - the dice are there to create the illusion you could fail, and that's what makes you feel like a hero when you succeed.  And that's one reason why I wouldn't want to do away with the dice altogether.<br/><br/>Also I often play diceless with my daughter and it really is less fun for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289901/#Comment_289901" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T11:30:46+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel that way but mainly with things like war games. I want a war game or a strategy game to be like a puzzle where if I think about it hard enough, I can figure out several best choices and pursue one. I don't want to make a best choice, then have my tank whiff three times and get blown up by lone infantryman.<br/><br/>But that's a strategy game. The thing about roleplaying games is that we're making stories, and sometimes really interesting stories can come out of that lone infantryman destroying a tank. How did he do it? Who was he doing it for? Was he lauded as a hero afterwards?<br/><br/>I have seen games do things you described. My favorite ever was a WoD game where I played a biker who was an expert at fighting with chains. Max skill, specialization chains. In our first session he got into a brawl, pulled out a chain, and then proceeded to knock himself unconscious with them over several critical failures. Ugh!<br/><br/>However I don't think that was the fault of dice. I think that was the fault of rules that <i>allow the dice to provide that sort of outcome</i>. Since then I've seen more and more of a trend of a bad roll of dice to ratchet up tension rather than make your character look like an asshole, and I've appreciated that because I've experienced all those things that you've listed as well. Luckily I've found some great games and haven't experienced it in a long time, starting with octaNe and leading right up to Burning Wheel and Apocalypse World which I'm playing right now and have yet to feel like I've been made a chump by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289906/#Comment_289906" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T11:37:12+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lorrraine</cite>I used to like dice, but slowly over the years I have discovered that I like them less and less.

It reminds me of boss battles in CRPGs where have your status attacks don't work so you just have to whittle away at hit points. It sounds like that would make interesting tactical encounters boring and predictable.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to make fearsome characters less impressive since they will eventually hit a string of bad luck and lose a fight they would normally easily win.</blockquote>\nThe string of bad luck is a bad problem, games are designed around averages, and dice will tend not to produce averages that consistently. That dice are truly random is probably the biggest problem, and it undermines entire character concepts. That Thief with 99% Climb walls who keeps rolling 00 five times in a row suddenly doesn't seem like a master climber. Character stats in a sense are game world truths, and dice results are also game world truths, the two should complement each other rather than contradict.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to slow the game to a crawl, especially if cross referencing tables or multiple roles to determine one thing come up.<br/></blockquote>\nThis has nothing to do with dice, per se, as ORE shows.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to roll in a situation where the result does not matter.<br/></blockquote>\nI disagree, sometimes that's the best time to roll the dice because it creates an interesting direction for the story. Setting up camp? Roll for cooking to see if it's burnt. It adds flavour to the story, even if it really doesn't matter.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to reward PCs for out of character, behavior, out of genre behavior, or poor tactical decisions.<br/></blockquote>\nStupid people should be punished?\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to provide nonsensical broken results.<br/></blockquote>\nYou could probably sum most of your complaints up into this one. The dice should complement, not contradict.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice rolling put into a game unless it serves some clear purpose that the rules could not handle without dice.<br/></blockquote>\nIf you take out dice, or any other randomiser, things get predictable. At that point you're just telling a story and not playing a game anymore.\n<blockquote><br/>Understand that I have seen every item on this list in actual play on multiple occasions over the years.<br/></blockquote>\nI have too, but more often than not, it's not the dice's fault. Sometimes it is, but often the problem doesn't stem from the dice and could be just as bad without dice and having the GM make a decision.\n<blockquote><br/>Does anybody else here feel this way about dice some or all of the time?</blockquote>\nSome of the time, I find a lot of the issues are solved by using cards, as you actually get properly averaged results, which takes out the problem of contradictory instead of complementary results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289910/#Comment_289910" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T11:39:11+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>I agree with all your individual points and yet...<br/><br/>I ran a game of Lady Blackbird, and none of your problems came up.

In fact, the players never missed a roll once - and the one time they missed, they used a secret to redo.  Thinking about it later, it was possibly the best session I've GM'd of any game ever.</blockquote>\nNow how is the mechanics of Lady Blackbird set up? Was that a matter of luck or are the odds such that failure is a really off chance?<br/><br/>This is kind of just theory to explain after-the-fact what I saw happen,<br/><br/>Your pool dice let you choose how many dice you're going to roll.  What I saw at the table was people would always grow their pool to 2x (or often 2x+1) the difficulty - so their expected value was success.  But what are their chances at that point?  At this point, I think we intuitively guess our odds are about 50-50, but really they're 65-35. (If I'm doing the math right.  It still doesn't explain what I saw at the table - I guess they just had a night of really good luck, or maybe there were a couple more missed rolls I've forgotten about.)<br/>And when you run out of dice you have a refreshment scene and get them back.<br/><br/>Conversely, I think with The Pool when you grow your pool to 6 dice you intuitively expect almost a 100% chance of success, but it's really only 67%.  (Huh, the same as the typical LB case.)  So my players were almost never growing their Pool that big, and often trying things they had &lt;50% at, hence all the disappointing and frustrating whiffs.<br/><br/>In short, I think LB is more fun because your odds are better than intuition tells you they are, and the Pool is vice-versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289985/#Comment_289985" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T13:32:20+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  1:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that helps a lot, yeah.

The 5th Age SAGA system also does this - since you have a number of cards to choose from, you could usually pick the right card to succeed, but since you don't want to waste high cards on something trivial, you might still fail, or if you do waste them, then a really difficult task could become insurmountable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290051/#Comment_290051" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T15:07:42+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  3:07PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 6:01PM by masqueradeball.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lorraine<br/>\nI never want dice to tell me that the skilled swordswoman lost to a noob.

Why can't a story be good where the protagonist constantly fails,  or where the big baddass gets eaten for breakfast by chance... seems to make a statement about the nature of fate to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBret: The oWoD botch rules I think did something that everyone misses: people always remember that you could botch, but they never remember that there were automatic successes. In combat this didn't work very well, but outside of it, I think the botch rules were intended to encourage players with high dice pools to move away from the dice and to rely on automatic successes instead. Mage even had a section on this entitled "Hubris" that specifically addressed the botching becoming more common as dice pools get higher. Rather clever design, IMO, if poorly implemented in terms of its relationship to the combat system, and, sadly, often unused. Even in combat you can mitigate this by splitting your die pool, another thing people rarely did. Make two attacks with smaller dice pools and there goes your chance of botching, and you're still totally BA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290107/#Comment_290107" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T17:22:25+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  5:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 5:24PM by misuba.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/148.html" rel="nofollow">Otherkind Dice.</a> [ETA: and by extension, most of the mechanics in Apocalypse World, which is really just an OkD hack.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290186/#Comment_290186" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T19:44:51+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  7:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/148.html" rel="nofollow">Otherkind Dice.</a>[ETA: and by extension, most of the mechanics in Apocalypse World, which is really just an OkD hack.]</blockquote>\nThat's really quite cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290206/#Comment_290206" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T20:41:04+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  8:41PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 10:24PM by XanatosChimera.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lorrraine</cite>I used to like dice, but slowly over the years I have discovered that I like them less and less.

(Whiff)</blockquote>\nTrue, but when the dragon is attacking me I am really hoping the GM whiffs.  When the wiff states that you don't see the Doberman sitting in the middle of the hallway because your perception check whiffed, that's something I don't want to see.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to tell me that the skilled swordswoman lost to a noob.</blockquote>\nDepends on if I'm controlling the skillsed swordsman that lost to a noob.  If I'm the swordsman and got taken out by a kobold, it sucks.  If I'm the noob and I took down the BBEG's Dragon then it's awesome.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to tell me that my character feels or thinks or does something other than what I want my character to feel or think or do.</blockquote>\nThis one I agree with in most situations.  Having dice dictate what your character can and cannot do almost ranks up there with arbitrary rules for balance's sake.  Cases where insanity is in play for the character or possession or magical/psychic mind control, this can be a helpful tool when stumped as to what the character says or does or thinks or feels.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to break an interesting tactical encounter turning it into a cakewalk or a slaughter.</blockquote>\nDepends again.  Part of the interest of combat is that one random lucky or unlucky event can completely alter the outcome.  I don't mind this type of event so much.  Sometimes it's annoying if it results in character death from a lucky kobold attack, but such is the nature of combat.  Depending on whether the system has instant death from an attack or merely being incapacitated will influence whether this type of even is a real nadir or just part of the chaos.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to make fearsome characters less impressive since they will eventually hit a string of bad luck and lose a fight they would normally easily win.</blockquote>\nThis is one I'll agree with.  Partly can be solved by not employing dice or other alterations to the die mechanics of a game.  The probabilities and averages are what you get most often over the long term, something that people seem to forget often when looking at the averages.  It is not uncommon for low probability outcomes to get grouped together into strings.  The average is the mode result of thousands of trials or events.  But have nothing to say about the outcome of any individual event or check.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to slow the game to a crawl, especially if cross referencing tables or multiple roles to determine one thing come up.</blockquote>\nAgreed.  Having the mechanics interfere in a unenjoyable way is a flaw in the design or indicates that the group should perhaps consider a different system.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to roll in a situation where the result does not matter.</blockquote>\nI think this comes down to individual gamer philosophy.  Sometimes I use dice to chose one option out of many where the choice isn't really relevant or important.  For me it can be an aid to making a quick decision and not holding up play (I have used this in character generation to decide class and gender and race).\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to reward PCs for out of character, behavior, out of genre behavior, or poor tactical decisions.</blockquote>\nI am not certain what is meant here.\n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice to provide nonsensical broken results.</blockquote>\nI'd say that pretty much sums up what a game's mechanics should not produce.  \n<blockquote><br/>I never want dice rolling put into a game unless it serves some clear purpose that the rules could not handle without dice.</blockquote>\nWhat constitutes unmanageable without dice will vary from group to group and tastes.

I'm thinking of Tales of Arabian Nights where I figured out the way to win was to have horrible stuff happen to my character, fortunately it's fun independent of winning or losing, but anything that gives you direct control like that becomes predictable.

And I also agree that some of the things I listed qualify as individual preference. I said I never want these things because I recognize that others might. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhiffing differs from failing. I love an interesting failure. I hate it when my character accomplishes nothing, not what they intended, not some unintended consequence, nothing at all. I played a game of Tekumel not that long ago where the vast majority of my dice rolls had no result whatsoever. Nothing happened in the shared fiction. Nothing good. Nothing bad. Nothing. It got to a sort of zen awfulness. My character could attempt absolutely anything without consequence because the dice would not cooperate. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read a lot of games. All too often when I read a game I get the impression that the designer tossed in dice because they think of dice as cool or because they think the gaming market expects dice and not because the dice actually serve a purpose. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of a broken nonsensical result (for Imperator): I once played in a Warhammer game where the GMs random road encounter rolls would have made travelling between cities nearly impossible except that these same random rolls occasionally included vulnerable travellers who miraculously made the same journey as our characters without ever facing the things that routinely attacked us. Better design of the tables in question or a GM decision to chuck the questionable results could have prevented this. In point of fact it gave the characters plenty of chance to earn XP, so it had benefits despite not making sense. I would rather have the characters have to travel to someplace more isolated to regularly find incredibly dangerous monsters or have a world where no one ever leaves there home town without an armed guard because either would have made sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the metaphor of dice as electricity. Some games just have bad wiring that can shock the players. Some GMs use games that don't have particularly bad wiring in ways that shock the players. Some games have wiring that doesn't do much which makes me wonder why they bothered installing the wiring at all. And finally some games have good wiring. Even with good wiring, you have to take the time to flip the switch (roll the dice) and watch the electricity flow (interpret the results). <br/>\n<br/>\nMetaphorically flipping that switch requires the players or at least the GM to switch from playing characters to interpreting the dice. I personally find doing so distracting. It causes my train of thought to slow or sometimes stop and it brings me at least partially out of character.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gaming group would laugh heartily at the idea my PCs behave perfectly rationally. I would describe my favorite characters as the interestingly broken ones. They do often have a consistent irrationality to them if you look closely enough. And definitely if I play a character long enough they begin to surprise me. I get to a point where the characters goals, desires, and behaviors take on a life of their own. That happens far more often for me in diceless games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, and I recognize this may not apply to anyone else, when my character wins a fight or accomplishes a goal because of a lucky die roll it feels like less of a success then when my character accomplishes things through cleverness, preparation, and/or hard work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will check out the games mentioned or linked in the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290561/#Comment_290561" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T14:20:11+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lorrraine</cite>I never want dice rolling put into a game unless it serves some clear purpose that the rules could not handle without dice.</blockquote>\nLorrraine, this is key, to me. I can't imagine why anyone would disagree with this concept.<br/><br/>Basically, when the dice (or other randomizing elements) hit the table, it's because this, here, now, is a potential turning point in the story. We should all feel that <i>not</i> using dice in this exact moment would be a missed opportunity. We should all think that one outcome would be awesome, but man, that other outcome would also be so awesome. Only a randomizing element can decide for us, and in doing so, manipulate the various resources and flags and elements that set up the next awesome situation.<br/><br/>Many - I'd hazard to say most - games are designed this way. As you say, there are some that aren't, that use the dice seemingly just because it's expected, and instruct GMs to call for dice rolls whenever it seems realistically necessary rather than whenever it is dramatically appropriate. I believe that these games are in the minority, but that a great deal of GMs have encountered such games and grown used to an absurd, punitive playstyle of calling for rolls (even though 4/5ths of the table is yawning) to maintain the illusion of a physics-based game world rather than a drama-based story world.<br/><br/>If I were you I'd check out Amber, for an example of a totally diceless game with drama-based resolution, and Apocalypse World, for an example of a totally dice-filled game where the dice drive the drama forward and the book tells the GM (=MC) exactly when rolls are appropriate and when they are not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290659/#Comment_290659" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T19:28:21+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  7:28PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/148.html" rel="nofollow">Otherkind Dice.</a>[ETA: and by extension, most of the mechanics in Apocalypse World, which is really just an OkD hack.]</blockquote>\nSuddenly I get where the mechanics from Ghost/Echo come from, which I haven't had the guts to try yet.<br/><br/>THESE ARE REALLY NEAT.
