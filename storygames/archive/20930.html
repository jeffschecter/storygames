It's not perfect for what you want, <a href="/forums/profile/icemaster109">@icemaster109</a>, as the PCs are ordinary citizens rather than cops, but it does contain an interesting hack:<br/><br/>Each of the players creates a suspect for the murders in addition to their own character. The GM takes over these characters during play, and marks a check on them each time they are investigated by the PCs. Once a suspect has three checks, the GM decides if this character is the killer, and if not, what it is they are actually hiding. From then on, everything they do is in line with their official (secret) motivation.<br/><br/>I myself started making a Fate Core build for a <i>Hannibal</i>-inspired game two years ago, but when it became apparent that my group don't like <i>Hannibal</i> I stopped working on it! In case it's of any use/inspiration, I'll paste in what I have below:<br/><br/><b>This is My Design</b><br/><br/><b>Summary</b><br/><br/>The player characters are all part of the FBI\u2019s Serious Crimes Unit, working together to catch and convict serial killers. However, in the true spirit of <i>Hannibal</i> the cases themselves are short-lived\u2014the real demons lie within the characters themselves.<br/><br/><b>Player Characters</b><br/><br/>The PC aspect list is slightly modified:<br/><br/><b>High Concept:</b> PCs\u2019 high concept must include a reference to their role in the Serious Crimes Unit. They might be Forensic Scientist, Agent, Special Agent, Forensic Psychologist, Consultant Profiler, or whatever you wish.<br/><br/><b>Trouble:</b> As per Core.<br/><br/><b>First Phase (Recruitment):</b> Describe how your character was trained for and recruited to their current position. Create an aspect relating to this. It might cover their motivation for being in the SCU, or a special skill that caused them to be headhunted.<br/><br/><b>Second Phase (Trauma):</b> Describe an early case your character worked on which has effected them deeply. This could also be a non-work-related encounter with evil. Create an aspect which reflects the lingering trauma of this event.<br/><br/><b>Third Phase (Teamwork):</b> Swap Trauma stories with another character and describe how your own character was involved in the case or event. Create an aspect which makes you useful to the other character, which makes them rely on you.<br/><br/><b>Secret:</b> Think of an aspect that will motivate your behaviour above and beyond normal SCU duty.<br/><br/><b>Secrets</b><br/><br/>Secrets are special aspects which give play bonuses for players pursuing their own interests. If you make a roll that relates to your Secret agenda, you get a +2 or reroll \u2018Secret Bonus\u2019 without having to spend a fate point.<br/><br/>The group must decide if Secret will be shared with everyone, or kept just between the individual players and the GM.<br/><br/>Once Secrets are revealed in-game, they are rewritten into normal aspects, or removed altogether if that is more appropriate. They no longer grant the Secret Bonus, although you can invoke them by spending a fate point like ordinary aspects.<br/><br/>Once all the players' Secrets are revealed in-game, the next milestone is Major and everyone gets a new Secret.<br/><br/>Not everyone's secret can be that they're a serial killer.<br/><br/><b>Skills List</b><br/><br/>Craft is general skill in all crafts and artistic endeavours. Specialisation in, for example, cooking or pencil drawing, should be done with a feat.<br/><br/>CSI encompasses everything to do with the scientific study of crime scenes and objects. It can also be used to resist CSI investigation - incorporating the knowledge, materials, and patience needed not to leave behind biological traces of your precedes.<br/><br/>Deceive is the psychological equivalent of Stealth. It includes lying, covering your true intentions, acting, the effective use of false identities, and avoiding suspicion. It is defended against by Empathy.<br/><br/>Empathy includes all kinds of psychological assessment including competence and sanity evaluations, but excludes their therapeutic applications. Defends against Deceive.<br/><br/>Investigate excludes CSI and psychological profiling, but includes research of all other kinds. It can be defended against by Stealth.<br/><br/>Fight includes all physical combat actions such as punching, throwing, and using all ranged and melee weapons. It is primarily an attack skill. It is the physical equivalent of Provoke and Rapport.<br/><br/>Medicine is the general mastery of medical science, excluding CSI. It can be used to heal yourself and others, but also to inflict damage in an accurate and controlled manner. <br/><br/>*Physique includes Athletics and Drive.<br/><br/>Provoke includes psychological manipulation as an attack action. (Defend with Rapport.) It is a psychological equivalent of Fight. It is defended against by Will.<br/><br/>Rapport includes psychiatric therapy, manipulation, and psychic leading as attack actions. It is a psychological equivalent of Fight. It is defended against by Will.<br/><br/>*Resources includes Contacts.<br/><br/>Stealth is the physical equivalent of Deceive. Sneaking about unseen, avoiding security cameras, wearing disguises, altering gaits, lock picking and bypassing security systems. It does not defend against CSI investigations (that\u2019s CSI) unless the character has a stunt to that effect, and it does not apply to creating believable false identities.<br/><br/>*Will is strength of will, strong sense of self, and general psychological robustness. It is the primary defence skill against Provoke and Rapport.<br/><br/>(*Starred skills give extra stress tracks in the appropriate band if held at Good or higher.)<br/><br/>Note that Notice has been removed. Perception is dealt with by the closest relevant skill to the situation - so someone with high CSI might notice a fingerprint, while someone with high Fight might notice the smell of a particular type of rifle. Passive perception gives characters automatic Succeed in skills that are Good or higher while Great skills will Succeed with Style. The perception skill for psychological states is Empathy.<br/><br/><b>Cases and Serial Killers</b><br/><br/>Like in <i>Eagle Eyes</i>, each Case has a Stress track and Consequences of its own. Cases can only be closed once all their Stress and Consequences have been dealt with. (For example, when Hannibal was in the BICI he was still able to case havoc: his imprisonment was simply a Major Consequence.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
