                    I am looking for a GMless game. On my limited research so far I came across Universalis and Polaris. Universalis seemed to be a pure story creation game and the players don't play as characters at all, so it didn't seem to be what I was looking for. Polaris, I didn't advance too much since it said it was a 4-player game that could be played with 3 or 5 players as well and since I plan to play mainly or at least partly with 2, I didn't look too much further.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know if there is a good GMless game where the players still play as a single character each (their main characters) while acting as the GM as well?<br/>
<br/>
In a sense, playing a D&amp;D style game GMless.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.                </div>

                            Hi Ronaldo.  Recently I have played both 'The Shab-al-Hiri Roach' and '1001 Nights', both of which are GM-less games where each player has their own character.  They probably work better with more than 2 players, though.<br/>
<br/>
This week I am playing 'Contenders' and after reading the rules I think it could work pretty well with only two people.  Especially since you could choose to create multiple NPC boxers to fight against.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

                            Beat to the punch about BtI and StM. Also, there's Capes. While you can get other characters during play, you could easily make a house rule to make it do what you want.                        </div>

                            I wouldn't discount <i>Universalis</i> so quickly. Though there aren't special rules for "PCs", to say that players "don't play as characters" isn't exactly true. Players still "play as characters", they just have the option of sharing characters or playing multiple characters. (Universalis may sound like a weird hippie game, but really, in practice it feels like any old RPG.) Whether or not control of individual characters is shared between players can be decided by the group. You can leave this decision informal, or you can formalize it through an official rules-tweak (there are official rules for modding rules).<br/><br/>BtI, StM, and the <i>Roach</i> are all short games, playable in 1-3 or so sessions. Is that the type of thing you're looking for?<br/><br/><i>1001 Nights</i> is a little tricky in the PC regard. Technically, yes, you play PCs. However, the game is about characters telling each other stories, where you role-play the stories. So the bulk of play is independent stories involving similar characters (within each individual story, you get cast in a role that is modeled after your "PC").<br/><br/>Out of all the games mentioned, <i>Polaris</i> is the most like "DnD GM-less". Ben (or anyone), have you tried playing Polaris 2-player?                        </div>

                            I'm with Ben here - look at Shooting the Moon, which could offer a really fun and interesting dungeon crawl with two or three participants.<br/><br/>The Roach limps along with three but is much better with four or more.  I think Polaris really needs four to rock.                        </div>

                            What Tim said about Universalis. Universalis has rules for formally altering the rules (called Gimmicks), and there are examples of "PC Gimmicks" on the website. (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ramshead.indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ramshead.indie-rpgs.com/</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Capes works out of the box, and would be good especially if you're looking to play supers. Though it can do other things as well, I suspect. And Capes might seem a little more traditional.<br/>
<br/>
But both come at this sort of game from the "author" angle. That is, even when playing your own character, you're thinking about their actions in terms of what effect it has on the story. If you want something a lot more traditional, then take a look at Rune: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.atlas-games.com/rune/" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlas-games.com/rune/</a><br/>
<br/>
In Rune you rotate being the GM, creating a hack n' slash gauntlet for the PCs to run.<br/>
<br/>
A "Proto-GMless" RPG was the Ergo project by Ian Millington. I can't find a working link to his stuff anymore, but here's an interview with him: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ptgptb.org/0020/coop.html" rel="nofollow">http://ptgptb.org/0020/coop.html</a><br/>

My upcoming games: Cutthroat and Standoff are both GMless.  Hierarchy has multiple GMs.  If you're looking for some games that deal with the issue in a few different ways, I'd recomend checking them out: http://divine-games.org/games.htm<br>

                            Thank you for the great suggestions so far. BTI sounds like a very good game but it doesn't seem to be what I am looking for. I would like a game where I could grab a friend and run a Dragonlance or A Game of Thrones or any given setting (Sci-Fi, Super Heroes) adventure or campaign with both of us GMing and playing. I don't think you can easily do that with Roach or 1001 Nights either, even though they seem to be great as well. <br>
<br>
I am intrigued by the comments that you could run a Dungeon Crawl with Shooting the Moon. And also that you could easily tweak the rules to have PCs on Universalis and I would really appreciate to learn more about this.                        </br></br></div>

Let's try and find something that will suit his desires, and not just suggest the hot game of the moment. It really doesn't sound like Ronaldo is looking for a game like BtI or the Roach. I don't own StM, and I only played a demo, but I have a feeling that's not really going to give a "DnD GM-less" feel.<br><br>Zak Arntson made a game called <a href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/fungeon/fungeon.html" rel="nofollow">"Fungeon"</a> that was some sort of GM-less dungeon crawl. I never played it, though, but it's worth checking out.<br><br>I bet it wouldn't be too hard to work out a GM-less version of <a href="http://www.crngames.com/donjon/index" rel="nofollow">Donjon</a>. Just make it so that each player has to "GM" the other... Hmm, has Clinton released the rules for Donjon using the Creative Commons? I bet Clinton would help you developed a GM-less version, or I could I give some thoughts (though I would need to refresh myself on the rules).                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>What this leaves me thinking is, um, I'm not sure that there is a game that will, <em>without significant work,</em> do what you ask, if I'm understanding you correctly to mean, "I am looking for a game where I can do the nonspecific sort of things you do in like D&amp;D or GURPS or PILLOW or whatever, except without that pesky GM bit."

                            Hey Ronaldo, why we're here, let me ask a question:<br/><br/>There are two styles of "GM-less" play. There's play where we just rotate who's the GM, so we take turns being the player and the GM. And then there's play where we both play and GM at the same time. What style were you looking for, or does it matter?<br/><br/>A game like Polaris and Rune (and potentially StM) rotate who's the GM. In Universalis and Capes you both play and GM at the same time.<br/><br/>I ask because I'm wondering if you're looking for party-style play, where your characters are together all the time. It's hard to get party-style play if you play a rotating-GM game, at least it would be with only 2 players. So it's something to consider.                        </div>

                            I will check the other games mentioned above like Fungeon and Donjon and others. Now, just to add some more details:<br/>
<br/>
"The alternative to that is to look for "some games" instead of "a system". I think you will have much more success there. (Functionally, many different foci is pretty similar to no focus, to me.)"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it would depend on what is available as far as GMless games go. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"There are two styles of "GM-less" play. There's play where we just rotate who's the GM, so we take turns being the player and the GM. And then there's play where we both play and GM at the same time. What style were you looking for, or does it matter?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it doesn't really matter. Ideally, the PCs should be able to be together as a party some times. Certainly, not all the time and probably not even most of the time together. But, together sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I am not familiar with many games but with my limited knowledge let me try to describe. Each player has a PC, they are all playing the same adventure and occasionally, connected pieces of adventure like most or many RPGs. Their could be a mechanism like PTA where they alternate taking turns framing scenes (or initiating framing a scene) and this could be for their own PC or some other PC. They would alternate control of the NPCs depending on whose PC is interacting and each would be free to add complications. I am not sure but may be all the players could be agreeing on the master story as a team and maybe as they goal. "The orkish cult is kidnapping maidens". Later on in the story - "they are using their blood to prolong the life or their dying last female" and so on.                        </div>

                            Hi Ronaldo,<br/><br/>To my knowledge, there's nothing that <i>quite</i> does what you want. My best two ideas would be:<br/><br/>1. Use the rules for Breaking The Ice, but do it all in a dungeon and replace "Attraction" with "Treasure" or "Fame". I know this sounds crap, but I think it could be really interesting. I'd love to try it myself.<br/><br/>2. Try <a href="http://www.crngames.com/the_shadow_of_yesterday/index" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Yesterday</a> GM-less. Have a quick discussion with your partner about what you want ("I want to explore a castle and defeat a wizard who controls minds"), then run through the adventure with both of you throwing things in ("Let's have some undead guards") and use the TSoY rules to resolve conflicts. <br/><br/>I think option 1 is what <i>I'd</i> do, but option 2 would work pretty well for you. TSoY is an amazing game and I think it'd be great as a pick-up-and-play thing.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Ronaldo, <a href="http://kallistipress.com/FLFS" rel="nofollow">Full Light, Full Steam</a> has rules for GMless and Troupe Play games, which work disturbingly well.  On the surface, it is about as bog-standard of a roleplaying game as you can get: everybody has a character and there's an "adventure" to do.  The adventure is built using some pretty well-defined rules, so a group can do it together as easily as the GM can do it in private (which I've done myself, and it really worked well as a group activity).  Then when you start up play, scenes are framed with a neutral mechanic called the spoils scrip that gets passed around the table.  The game as-written is for steampunk space opera, but if you got a bee in your bonnet to play something different, it would just be a matter of picking six new attributes and listing off thirty skills.                        </div>

<br/>
I can attest to this.  I wrote up my two-player actual play <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/2006/10/09/actual-play-from-the-campsite/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It's not really a GM-less game, but I could see how you could potentially set it up as a 2-player GMful(ish) game, because the PCs aren't necessarily together.  In fact, it's almost an oddity that they <b>are</b> together.  So, I could see switching roles, scene by scene.  This scene is about Trollbabe A, so Player B does the GM work.  The next scene is for Trollbabe B, so Player A does the GM work.<br/>
<br/>
Now there is some prep associated with Trollbabe, but there's not all that much.  So it shouldn't be that onerous for either player.  Then, during the game, you can actually play off against each other's prep.  It could be really cool!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I'm liking this idea a lot....                        </div>
