It is rocking so hard it's hard to believe. Screen presence and fan mail are genius. We do not have to change a thing to be having a wildly successful game.<br/><br/>It's just that conflict feels like it could rock <i>even more</i>, but I'm not entirely getting it. We very often have trouble "finding" the conflict in the scene, even when it's populated full of amazing characters who want very different things. Either we're all so totally on the same page that we just <i>know</i> what has to happen next, or all the possibilities of what <i>could</i> happen are so equally awesome that nobody can invest too deeply in any one outcome: it's just as interesting to lose as to win.<br/><br/>The show is called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Folk Noir</span>. It's a glorious ripoff of Fables / Shrek / Thursday Next, in which fairy-tale characters (the "Folk"), driven from their ancestral homelands ("Story"), live a secret life beneath the noses of mortal ("Reader") society. It's a detective show, centered on Charming Investigations, a private-eye office founded by ex-prince Sam Charming (an NPC). I've put character details <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and episode synopses</span> below.<br/><br/>So for an example of how conflict is hard to "find," consider a scene from Episode 3: <br/><br/>Red (Riding Hood) and her ex-boyfriend Gray (The Big Bad Wolf) have been kidnapped by bounty hunters Bo (Peep) and Brick (the eldest Pig). The rest of the cast -- Baba Yaga, Mr. Bridges the troll, and Timmy the lit major -- face off against Regina Hart (the Queen of Hearts), a thoroughly criminal-seeming woman they've spent the better part of two episodes investigating. The team wants to rescue Red; Regina Hart wants to procure an item Gray is carrying. They agree to work together.<br/><br/>We played through this (fun and thrilling!) plot scene without "finding" the place to use mechanical conflict. You'd think it would be something about agreeing to work with a criminal. But the whole thing just felt so <i>right</i>. Of <i>course</i> this was the part of the show where the good guys and the bad guy team up against a secondary bad guy! The power of the trope <i>sang</i> to us! We couldn't put any of that stuff at risk: everyone at the table agreed it was way too awesome. So in the end I wedged in a halfhearted conflict about the terms of the agreement to work together, and it really just didn't matter much.<br/><br/>"Work in their issues!" I expect to hear. And I know, I know... I feel like I know that in my head, but I'm just not <i>grokking</i> it in the moment. "Does Timmy convince Regina he's important even though he's not magical?" Meh. "Does Mr. Bridges trust Regina not to entangle him in his criminal past?" Vague. "Does Yaga use reason or fear to drive her end of the bargain?" Weak.<br/><br/>Sometimes we get it. In the follow-up confrontation between Red and Gray vs. Bo and Brick, at stake for Red was: "Do you lose Gray?" <i>That</i> clicked beautifully, since this was her spotlight episode and she'd just started to trust him again.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, Red and Gray's prior scene was completely conflict-free! It was classic: two ex-lovers, captive together, who can't possibly escape unless they learn to trust each other again. And we set up the scene, and we roleplayed it... and <i>everyone</i> at the table wanted Red to learn to trust Gray, myself included. It was Red's spotlight episode. Of <i>course</i> something like that would happen. Her story arc demanded it and we made it so.<br/><br/>We are operating at a crazy-high 95% level of fun right now, but this conflict thing nags. Help me hit the final 5%! How am I failing to find mechanical conflict and uncertainty in all these otherwise wildly satisfying scenes?<br/><br/>Adam C.<br/><br/>-----<br/>Show: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Folk Noir</span><br/><br/>Protagonists:<br/><br/><b>Baba Yaga</b><br/>Issue: She wants to be loved instead of feared -- but fear's such an easy tool...<br/>Edges: Witch Magic, Bad Reputation<br/>Connection: The Bear of Russia (a fellow Folk from the old country, he alone really understands how far Yaga has come from her wicked ways)<br/>Nemesis: Sam Charming (Yaga's godson.

I think this sort of situation was handled fairly well in Lost, when the Hot Chick and the Charming Scoundrel were kidnapped.  Here's some of the things they did:<br/><br/>* Kept them in separate cages, but within sight and shouting distance of each other.<br/><br/>* Worked on them individually.  When Bo shows up to feed Gray, and Gray puts the old suave moves on her, how does Red feel about that?  Can Red bring herself to make some moves on Brick?  If Gray talks Red into making a move on Brick, and then Gray has to watch the result, how does he feel about it afterwards?  Lots of potential for dramatic reversals here.<br/><br/>I'd be working Red's Grandmother connection like a redheaded stepchild.  She's all too happy to help Regina get ahold of Gray -- she hates that guy more than anyone, and for some very good reason.  Conflict between Red and Grandma over Gray will make everything better, I think.<br/><br/>As a general recommendation, I think finding conflict with this sort of thing is about finding things that the characters and players really care about, and then placing those things in harm's way.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238980/#Comment_238980" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T08:10:21+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  8:10AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, this game sounds lots of fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nI especially like the character of Timothy Geisler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue of Mr. Bridges is a little problematic to me, because it's about external forces rather than internal. So his criminal past is catching up with him. Okay. What does it mean for him? Is he just trying to forget his past and move on? Why? Is he trying to redeem himself? How? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll his Edges and Connections, and Nemesis, are connected to that past. Is there anyone or anything he cares for that could be put at risk by his past? Suppose this person or thing was placed in danger, and then the bad guys offered him the help he needs in exchange for his assistance in a job or some other shady favor? Or maybe someone else is killed wounded trying to protect the Troll from the Cartel.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Geisler, he is the one with the doubts. Conflicts should be created so that he believes he can do some good. Match his against overpowering foes, in situations where only him can help, and let him fail or succeed, further advancing his issue in either case.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaba Yaga wants to be loved. By whom? Everybody? However, she's also used to using fear as a tactic to get what she wants : old habits die hard. Create conflict that could be solved by being friendly and nice, but that could be solved much faster and easier by being mean and scary! Put people she likes at stake, like the Bear. The Bear's life is at stake, she has to work fast. But will he approve of her resorting to her old habits just to save him? But what if she doesn't and puts his life in jeopardy for the sake of her breaking of old habits, will he forgive her? Could she forgive herself?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238981/#Comment_238981" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T08:35:49+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  8:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good suggestions so far, but I just wanted to chime in and say don't worry, if there's no conflict, there's no conflict, just do the scene and then it's the next player's turn.

The conflict mechanics simply don't work if the characters don't want mutually incompatible things from one another.<br><br>Like, in your scene with Bridges / Baba / Tim and Regina... I don't see a deep, abiding conflict of interest between any character. I instead see an overwhelming, abiding unity of interest between them. They both have a strong motivation for Red and Gray to go free. Gray isn't there to say anything about whether he wants to keep the item he's carrying or not. So, no conflict. Later, after the rescue, when Regina says, "Hey, pony up this item, we made a deal," and Gray says "Hell, no," it gives the PCs the opportunity to take sides and thus engenders conflict potential. <br/><br/>Same thing with Red and Gray's prior scene - both of them want to go free, and you said they needed one another to do it, so there's no conflict of interest there. Of course they're going to work together. It'd only be a conflict if one of them *could easily get free if they left the other behind*, or something to that effect, *and* one of them had a strong reason for being tempted to do that. That situation would also have squarely touched on the trust issues between them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
