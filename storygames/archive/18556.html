My <b>Spectrum</b> time travel role-playing game is now available as a PDF from <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/114324/Spectrum?" rel="nofollow">DriveThruRPG</a>, at a limited-time low introductory price.<br/><br/><b>Spectrum</b> uses a regular playing cards, and a simple core mechanic for physical and social interactions (card draw+Trait to achieve target number), to allow the players and the Guide to focus on the complexities of really detailed time travel.  Yes, you can travel anywhere and anywhen in time and space, but you can also travel back into scenes you've already played, alter established history, call on your past or future self for help, be in two places at once, and solve problems before they happen.  <br/><br/>A Spectrum campaign is non-linear.   Characters' power and experience is reflected in their color.  Sometimes you will be a weak, confused novice (Dark, Red, or Orange), sometimes powerful and experienced (Indigo, Violet, or Light), and each player chooses their characters' colors out of sequence, so there are always some characters who remember things that haven't happened yet, or who don't remember things that have already happened. <br/><br/>Here is a brief description of the mechanics over at <a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=607&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Praxis</a>. <br/>And here is some <a href="http://maycontainmonkeys.wordpress.com/category/spectrum-playtest/" rel="nofollow">Actual Play</a>. <br/><br/>I am now looking for the best ways to promote this game, and get reviews.  My questions are:<br/><br/>Where I might send this game for review?  What specific sites or reviewers would you recommend for this game?<br/>How else can I promote this game, to introduce it to potential players?<br/>I am waiting for the game to be accepted at Indie Press Revolution. Are there any other sites where I should consider hosting the game for sale?<br/>I am new here.  Am I using Directed Promotion correctly?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
