                    It says in advancement that you need to be taught Secrets.  I looked about and didn't put a finger on Species and Cultural keys.  Can you learn them across cultures?  Is it easier or harder?  What have you done in your games and is there somewhere I missed that goes into it.                </div>

                            If I were to guess it looks like I couldn't learn Species Secrets but I could cultural ones.                        </div>

                            That seems workable, as a matter of group taste - but my "interpretation" would lean toward allowing only Universal secrets/keys were available to alien characters, just to keep the cultures nicely deliniated in the mechanics.<br/><br/>Keep in mind i don't own the book, i've just been trying to assimilate the rules via the free online document (to see if i can run it generically as a pick-up game).... <br/><br/>How does it work in HeroQuest? That's the direct ancestor....                        </div>

                            Like everything undefined in TSOY, it's up to you and your group, but my use is that you can of course be taught Cultural Secrets, and should. The game's all about cross-cultural learning (I mean, in that characters will become culturally mixed pretty easily in a game.) Species Secrets are different, in that your species can change, so those pretty much are unique to the species, although I'd allow someone to buy one with a good reason.<br/><br/>Now I want to play a human raised by ratkin.                        </div>

                            Speaking for HQ, this is the discussion of the Heortling Duck on one hand, and the discussion of Arkat as Troll on the other. Basically it's unusual, but possible in HQ for somebody to be brought up in a culture that's unusual for the species. A common exception is a Duck raised in a Heortling village. The duck gets the duck species, but the Heortling cultural package.<br/>
<br/>
Further it's theoretically possible that a character has spent his life split between more than one culture, and has learned both - like my real life friend Sean who grew up in both Paris and in Madison here in the US. He is truely bicultural (having him surprise French people with his perfect unaccented French when they're being rude to a supposed American is very fun).<br/>
<br/>
More common, however, is to have the "Traveler" keyword, where one knows the languages and cultural traditions of other places, but is not truely poly-cultural. I suggest that a Traveler Secret would be awesome in TSOY (if it doesn't already exist).<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to species, though it seems absurd to assume that one can change species... that's exactly what Arkat did in Glorantha. At one point be decided to become a troll. This requires a heroquest - basically a great magic ritual - but it can be done.<br/>
<br/>
Now there's some argument about whether or not Arkat physically transformed into a troll, or whether he was simply culturally accepted as a troll. But that's all Glorantha stuff. For Near, or another world, it's as plausible as you want to make it. I like to think that Arkat actually changed into a Troll - that's much more magical. But for your game, you're going to have to decide for yourself whether this is possible. If you do, of course, you're deciding to allow the character to change what is likely something that is very core to his existence. I think that's cool, but it's pretty wooly.<br/>

                            Great!  Thanks folks.<br><br>Would it be out of character for the game to fitz with the XP system? basically using some Exalted tropes and make Cultural Abilities, Secrets and Keys more expensive to advance for characters outside the culture (maybe two advances or 7-10 XP per advance)?<br><br>I like the quest to change species idea.  I may works that in somhow.  I also like the traveller idea.  Alternatively, I might have the Traveller secret just allow someone to learn cross cultural stuff.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

This struck me.  This connection isn't really obvious to me other than in the broadest of terms.  What parts are HQ inspired?                        </div>
