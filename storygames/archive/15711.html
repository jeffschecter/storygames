I'm slowly researching Wuxia literature/movies as well as researching the culture (as seen through wuxia movies.)  I've got two games to finish this year, so the bulk of writing won't happen until next year. <br/><br/>Ivan: If she's willing to help, and please ask her for me and tell her I'd appreciate it a great deal, in advance! If she has the time that is, I don't want to burden anyone with my problems, just get a boost of help since I live in a small town in West Texas, my access to such information is non-existent and I want to do a good job and not mangle the language too much.<br/><br/>Eero: Part of the reason I'm asking here is I couldn't find a way to private message either of the two on these forums to ask. I was also encouraged to seek those born in the culture for specific help as well, not that I mind any help!<br/><br/>Thank you both.<br/><br/>I'll share a bit of the game later and see what I need this weekend for my rough draft. <br/><br/>Primarily its names of things/places for example: I think I've settled on "Heroes of the Jeweled River" as a game name, whatever that would be in Chinese (I know there are several significantly different dialects and I'd like to stick to one.)<br/><br/><br/>The general concept is a space opera game that draws its tropes from wuxia stories--things like Condor Heroes, the Book and the Sword, and other books (I am not to movies yet..since they're harder to find locally.)<br/><br/>I've images of painted star-junks sailing through a rainbow colored hyperspace, and heroes fighting with weapons that have etchings of light deflecting the occasional energy bolt while leaping into battle. Misunderstandings putting them at war with another until they realize the mistake and turn around and become friends/allies. <br/> <br/>The SF/SO concepts are that a distant Emperor dwells on a Golden Palace in a system covered by a Dyson sphere. Two suns (unnaturally) serve the worlds of the system and the Emperor rules from his city. He is both immortal and has changed faces over the years. Since he is the holographic face of a Jovian Brain Quantum computer and may be the source of hyperspace itself. He is protected and gained rule with the power of 4 dragons. Ancient battleships that put modern ones to shame. He was built by unknown people but his mandate is to keep the Empire running, and does so by making tough choices. However, his governors/sector lords are often corrupt hence the rise of xia.<br/><br/>Monks collate data from digital wall scrolls for his use, and he only advises from his world and never leaves it. Primarily the game is visual imagery at the moment. Humans, Cricket men, Foo Lion, and River Dragons span the stars and deal with each other and the "lesser" empires around them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356250/#Comment_356250" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T08:38:44+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  8:38AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you need someone with a strong background in wuxia lit, not just Chinese.  I've read the Water Margin and stuff, but much less of the kind of modern wuxia lit you're talking about (which didn't really exist before the 20th century).  To my ear, "Heroes" and "River" are totally fine for a wuxia title but "Jeweled" sounds a little strange, both as a Chinese term (traditionally, China doesn't care about jewels that much, except in Buddhism, where they are metaphors) and as something you would associate with a river. Is it a particularly Buddhist river? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But, then, I'm not a wuxia expert, just a guy who's spent 15 years learning modern Chinese, which is different from the more archaic language used in wuxia.<br/><br/>Honestly, while it's a good idea to have someone to bounce terms off of, is there really a reason that all the terms have to have a Chinese equivalent included in the game?  Because if wuxia and Chinese isn't really your background, are that many Chinese or Chinese-speaking players going to play it?  Do you really have connections with that audience enough to make a game for them?<br/><br/>If you really want to make a truly authentic-feeling wuxia game, there's no real way around the hard work it will require to do that: reading a ton of wuxia lit, learning about China and even learning the language.  Watching some movies isn't going to cut it, I don't think.  That's a long, intimidating mission to embark on with no background. But it doesn't sound like that's what you want to do, really.  I mean, your game is set in space, so it seems like aiming for an authentic-feeling game is already kinda out the window.  Putting some Chinese terms in your game isn't going to save you from making a game that's mostly not-particularly-Chinese with a veneer of cultural appropriation.  There's a ton of that stuff in gaming, of varying quality, so I don't think it's particularly bad or immoral to make yet another Orientalist fantasy game (I really like The Mountain Witch and Mist-Robed Gate and certain parts of Exalted, for example), but it's good to be aware and honest about what you're doing.<br/><br/>The other option is to refocus and write a game about what you know (including the fictions and cultures and places that you've spent the most time understanding and mastering).  There's no reason you can't make a space-fantasy game that rocks, or even a wuxia-inspired space-fantasy game that doesn't feel particularly authentic, but it's important to know what reasonable goals are and what your limitations might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356263/#Comment_356263" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T09:41:54+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  9:41AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, let's keep in touch and I think we can give you a hand.<br/><br/>Also, everything Jonathan said.

Watching some movies isn't going to cut it, I don't think.</blockquote>\nHmm: I definitely agree on the "reading tons (or at least as much as you can) wuxia lit", and learning about China *in that context*, but I don't think you have to go as far as learning the language, as long as you recruit a native or native-level speaker (and by that I mean "also familiar with cultural tropes" etc) to do your editing and correcting.<br/><br/>Frex, I've been involved in tons of little Japanese-themed gaming things, from finding the kanji for "Kagematsu" (all in all it was about 5 hours of work! it's kind of a long story), to translating or finding quotes for Blood and Honor, to Blossoms are Falling, to things like "Hey what's a good name for a Japanese-born FBI agent whose personality is like this [xyz]"? <br/>(to compare, show a Japanese speaker a copy of L5R. CRINGE)<br/><br/>In all those cases, the author had at least some background in what they were doing enough to make it a "good treatment" of the material and not the whole sticky cultural appropriation thing.<br/><br/>But having that native language-speaking cultural/linguistic editor/helper makes all the difference, I think. It's the difference between a piece that steals from the culture to appeal to us, vs working within that culture to bring out cool and real things to appeal to us. And often there are lessons to be learned as well, or things where you had a name for a spaceship or attribute or person that came off bad in the original language, and instead are suggested something (by said editor) that actually becomes COOLER because it's got a story - and reality - behind it to situate it. <br/><br/>So I agree: Read up as much as you can, be in love with what you are writing about (and maybe TIm needs to do a little more reading; I hear GMS is a Wuxia-reading-monster from waaaay back in the day, might want to ask him for good literature and sources). This keeps the game material "situated/real" (as I mention above) to boot. But when it comes to actual language, do what Tim is doing and ask for outside help.<br/><br/>Tim: Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356278/#Comment_356278" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T10:20:21+00:00" title="January 27, 2012 10:20AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and while Chinese/Japanese is different, a lot of the Old Words in Japanese come straight from Chinese, or at least were similar enough that they feel the same (it's why I can read/understand a lot of Wuxia "secret move names" and the like: I couldn't understand any of the original Weapons of the Gods in Chinese, for example, but I could read all of the technique/magic/secret moves!), and I had the same reaction to Jonathan re Heroes, River, and Jeweled, all the way down to the recognition re Jewel --&gt; Common to Buddhism --&gt; Usually as metaphor.<br/><br/>BUT, metals were big in ancient Japanese/Chinese words to describe heavenly bodies. SILVER, in particular, is used a great deal. Not sure about Chinese, but in Japanese there's several bodies that use silver, and in fact the Milky Way is "River of Silver".

The main issue is that I've envisions hyperspace as colorful (like streaking past rainbow colored star streaks.) Hence the "Jeweled River" aspect. Originally I called it a road but River fits more with the tone/starships concept.<br/><br/> Its a long way out because I AM doing research, I always do. I mentioned two of my favorites writings above (Condor Heroes, Book and the Sword) and I'm picking up more as I can and read them. However, I've looked at "inspired by" wuxia stories vs actually translated wuxia stories, and have found little that I think is as good. (Ex: Dream of the Dragon Pool, just doesn't feel right to me, despite its inspiration.)  I've recently reread Journey into the West among others. (Albeit that's a bit over the top for the kind of wuxia game I'm aiming for--a little bit anyway.)<br/><br/>My original name was over used so I thought I'd take the setting element (hyperspace) and use it for part of the name.
