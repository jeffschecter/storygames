                    Interesting, question. <br/><br/>Before Jack Spencer Jr wiped clean his blog <i>again</i>, he stated that he was getting out of the hobby. Fine and dandy, as a lot of his play just wasn't satisfying. No need to dig further than that. <br/><br/>What struck me was that Clinton wrote a very cool comment to him (now probably erased) encouraging him to really get into another hobby that he could love: crafts, sports, whatever. Something solid to keep depression at a minimum and the like. He mentioned (whether he gave it a lot of thought or not) that he feels like he's got about 5 years left in the hobby before he may wander off to new fields. It was some real encouragement, and very cool of him to do so.<br/><br/>However, those comments were really interesting to me in terms of "feeling when the quitting time is approaching" and "finding something new to replace it". I was wondering if anyone else had given any thought to:<br/><br/>* A natural series of events that may lead them to leave this hobby.<br/><br/>* Other hobbies or activities that would take its place.<br/><br/>* What that shift in gears would entail. How would you change?<br/><br/>* And have you given it serious thought?<br/><br/>* Other related thoughts you had about quitting the hobby?<br/><br/>(mine will be posted soon)<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            I gave serious thought to leaving RPing in the late 90s. It was before I knew the Forge existed, and before my current group(s) were playing. Between frustration at being unable to do what I wanted with game and inability to get a group going that I could stand, much less expirement and dig into deep drama with, I was about a hair away from quitting. <br/><br/>MUSHing kept me going for an extra year or so, and then almost completly killed RPing for me. Luckily I found a few good players whom kept my interest up, and eventually I found the Forge and then my current group. It all moved me from "almost done" to "new golden age" by about 2003. <br/><br/>So will I ever be finished RPing? Sure, but only if I get stuck someplace and can't get out, can't do anything new, and can't tell any new story or kind of story with it. But as I don't see that happening, I've not given it any serious thought.                        </div>

                            Considering that I've made RP a major component of my academic career . . . no, I can't really imagine quitting.  I suppose if I didn't have a good group, I wouldn't have much motivation to continue, but since my partner and I do amazing one-on-one games, I doubt that's ever likely to happen even if I do have to move out of New York someday.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            I thought about giving up RPGs a couple of months ago. The games I was playing and the way they were being play just weren't doing it for me. Not unlike Jack, I was starting to think that what I was looking for was something completely different than RPGs.<br/><br/>Then I wrote that list of Story Game Rules and posted it here and on my blog. I started actively getting people to play other games with me. And then I looked back over my youth and realized that long before I'd discovered RPGs, playtime for me meant Stories and Games.<br/><br/>So...as long as I can find people to play with me, I'm not sure I'll ever give it up. Since my wife is up for all sorts of games, including the kinds of story games I'm interested in, I won't really ever lack for someone to play with. At least until dementia sets in on one or both of us. But we joke that we'll be in an old age home organizing story games.                        </div>

                            I already gave up RPGs, then came back. Then, lost most of my players due to life. I mainly play at conventions and when visiting distant friends, these days, which isn't enough exposure to drive me over the edge.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess this means: I'll give up RPGs when they pry the dice from my cold, dead hands.                        </div>

Which I kind of doubt will happen.  I've been frustrating with gaming a lot, but never bored.  The only other thing that still hasn't bored me is fiction.<br/>

Almost everything else gets dull after 3-4 years.<br/>

                            I'm with Matt. I gamed some in High School. spent the rest of my life chasing Sim Asthetics that I never played. then about two years ago a friend who hasn't played since goes to a life coach and decides he want to game again with his buddies. I hold a game build a Roman Briton Thing and we play. the rest of us got together about three or four times a year since then. I found some great people on FindPlay and started gaming weekly. I really feel like I've just started.                        </div>

                            I cycle in and out a little bit (LEGO did take over my life for a while, though I did still get in a bit of RP with Evil Stevie's Pirate Game). I don't expect to ever wander far from RPGs because there's a thought exercise that I haven't fully been able to qualify, that I have also found nothing else that gives me the same thought exercise.<br/>

                            It's a strange question. You wouldn't ask "When will you stop going to the cinema?" or "When will you stop going to the theatre?" in the same way. Why should RPGs be a different sort of social event: one where we make this decision to give them up?<br/>
<br/>
So I'll probably give them up for a while, when I get bored, or when there's not people around to play them with. And then, a few years later, I might play them again. It all depends on the people.<br/>

<blockquote>It's a strange question. You wouldn't ask "When will you stop going to the cinema?" or "When will you stop going to the theatre?" in the same way. Why should RPGs be a different sort of social event: one where we make this decision to give them up?</blockquote>
You're right!<br/><br/>When will you stop reading novels?<br/><br/>When will you stop playing board games?<br/><br/>The question kind of implies playing RPGs isn't just something you do, it's a "movement" or a "lifestyle" or something. A fad, that you take up for a while and then drop it when the next cool thing comes along.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I have actually thought about leaving gaming completely.  Becoming one of those 'non-gamer wives' I'd heard so much about.  There was a time where nothing about gaming was any fun anymore.  Even though playing with my husband (Eric) was great.  It was the groups we were part of and/or the games we were playing.  Just not satisfying and there was a time where being the only female was most certainly hampering my fun.  (That's a story for a different place and time.)  <br/>
<br/>
But now that I've been able to find people of a like mind and interest as myself in gaming again, I think the day I waill stop gaming is as taylsman and ross said "When they pry the dice from my cold, dead hands."  Hell, I may have them cremate me with some so that I'll have something to do until I'm reincarnated.  *laugh*<br/>

I was thinking he same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, when it stops being rewarding I'll certainly stop.  I stopped playing soccer for a while when it just wasn't fun and came back to it.<br/>
<br/>
What's that line from that baseball movie, The Natural, "I lost my love of the game for a while."<br/>

But I'd always come back eventually.                        </div>

                            I often leave roleplaying, just as I often leave my other hobbies. Eventually I come back, dig out the boxes, and, thus renewed, am awesomer than before. Of course I'm so awesome now that this doesn't seem likely to happen again.                        </div>

                            Sorry about my own reply, been really busy:<br/><br/><b>* A natural series of events that may lead them to leave this hobby.</b><br/><br/>It could happen, though I can't really see through the veil that far. Recently I've been into serious exercising again, as well as investing and investing-related research, which is really interesting. Both are pretty time-consuming. However, I did actively look at other cultural-like hobbies, and the only one I could think of was music: I'd like to learn the piano someday...<br/><br/>...but socially? I can't think of any social activity that gets me more interested to be with people than gaming at this point. Video games don't cut it (not even online ones); music doesn't cut it, because most musicians in the area sort of get on the stage do their thing, and go home; crafts MAY do it, but I'm not too interested in crafts (unlike my wife, who is hardcore into pottery these days, going to several lessons at once).  I'm not into sports that don't involve punching, so team games are right out (though I was contemplating starting a local dodgeball team, but that's more for my love of dodgeball than other people).<br/><br/>Board games come close, and while I dig playing with friends, most of them I get bored with after 2 hours. Theatre is pretty solid on the social realm, but I'm a little wary of hardcore theatre types, as they tend to be just as fucked up as gamers.<br/><br/>I may get burned out on having too many gaming groups, at which point I'd set up a bi-weekly "meet at the coffee house" thing. I may get burned out on talking about games, at which point I'd stop (RPGNet, which has been my daily bread and butter for like 7 years, only attracts me like once a day or once every two days, and no longer like 5-100 times a day).<br/><br/>So at this point, I've given it lots of consideration, and while I can't make "cold, dead hands" statements, it's definitely not on my 8-year horizon.<br/><br/><b>* Other hobbies or activities that would take its place.</b><br/><br/>Oh, I kinda mentioned that above. There are other hobbies that I'd like to do that could totally cut into gaming time, at which I'd have to reconsider gaming: Getting more into Japanese study, and the aforementioned exercise and investing and possibly music (tho I had that tucked as an "aside" when I turn 40).<br/><br/>But nothing else that's really social. Luckily, a lot of my local gaming friends also do social things, so I've been covered on that front (especially with local music and religious/spiritual events). I've been meaning to hang with Remi and Jason more, for their Play Readings and Karate Movie Nights and stuff, but again it's doing social things with gamers who are also friends, at which point gaming is just an inch away.<br/><br/><b>* What that shift in gears would entail. How would you change?</b><br/><br/>Hmmmm. I'd have to have a pretty fundamental shift. Like get into a hobby that I thought was non-social but turned out to be TOTALLY social. And at the same time get into another hobby that acts as a total creative outlet. The only thing that would change is the amount of praxis and creativity would be funneled elsewhere.<br/><br/>I could just get like three promotions and be a total executive "all work and no play" type, but I do have a feeling that even if I'm making a quarter mil a year, I'd still be killing Orcs on Thursday nights (like Alan in my gaming group, who is almost there).<br/><br/><b>* And have you given it serious thought?</b><br/><br/>Yeppers. "Pry from my cold, dead hands" doesn't ring as strongly for me, but I've given it some serious thought and I'm still going to be a gamer for a long while.<br/><br/><b>* Other related thoughts you had about quitting the hobby?</b><br/><br/>No, that's about it, aside from the thoughts of what would take its place, and how well or not well that would all work out...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Honestly, "cold dead hands" doesn't reasonate for me because, like everything else that I do -- _everything I do_ -- I don't consider role-playing part of who I am.  I don't "self-identify" with any facility, so even if I derive a lot of enjoyment from noodling with my own designs, meeting weekly to talk design and roleplay, look forward to getting 10 indie games in the mail, and list role-playing stories as some of my favorite personal anecdote, I don't really consider myself a "roleplayer," "game designer," or "gamer."  Not really.  I mean, I guess those terms might describe me, but there's a lot of terms that might describe me.<br/>
<br/>
So, might I leave RP as a hobby, as an art form, or as a component of my life?    It's a decided possibility.  But most likely because I'd simply drift away into other things.                        </div>

                            The "cold dead hands" comment, in the context of what I was saying, at least, is that I don't see roleplaying as something I can get permanently bored with, or something that I can "use up all the fun" so that I can't possibly do it again. Like reading, watching plays or film, as Graham pointed out. You get bored with individual books or movies or plays, but who on earth says "I've read everything I will ever need to read. I will never read again!" At least, not without some kind of ideological motivation?<br/>
<br/>
Because I've "left" gaming and come back several times already, and because my gaming right now is pretty intermittent, I can't say "I'll never roleplay again". When the right game and players present themselves at the right time, I game, no matter whether a week has gone by since the last game, or a month, or years.  My decision is based on my desires at the moment, not on a decision I made years before. <br/>
<br/>
I don't see gaming as an identity issue, either, but I have to take past experience as future predictor; even if I never game again for years and years, I still have to expect that maybe I will get a pick-up game going in the nursing home when I find out some of the other 80-year olds are feeling nostalgic, too.                        </div>

                            I've already left gaming once for 6 years during college and part of graduate school, so I can't foreclose the possibility of leaving again. I think I'll always be interested in the creative and social parts of gaming, but I'm at the stage where I won't put up with bad gaming just to have it in my life - there are too many other worthwhile things to be doing. So if I couldn't find a sufficient number of like-minded gamers (something I'm actually facing in Phoenix currently), I'd probably end up taking a break.<br/><br/>I can also see that having kids or another big family transition could cause me to give up regular gaming. Game groups seem to require regular schedules, a commodity in short enough supply as it is. <br/><br/>Without gaming I'd probably shift to more exercise, writing, and board games. I do a bit of each now, so they'd be the gap fillers. <br/><br/>The thought of giving up gaming makes me kid of sad, like giving up some vestige of youth, but I would always be open to coming back and I definitely would not sell off my gaming books.                        </div>

                            Graham nailed it. "When will you stop reading novels?" It's just as pointless a question. No offense to Clinton, but his comment about having 5 years left in the hobby is just plain silly. What is it, a tour of duty?<br/>

I'll play RPGs when I feel like it. I won't when I don't. Feel free to replace "RPG" with any other leisure activity.                        </div>

                            It seems to me that the entire question ("When will you stop playing RPGs?") is absolutely tied up in the myth that playing RPGs isn't just playing RPGs, it's a social identity, like being gay isn't just having homosexual sex, it's liking Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland. It's that myth that when you play RPGs, you belong to this subcuture, with its Mountain Dew and Cheetos and listening to Rush and wearing t-shirts with pictures of 20-sided dice.<br><br>And it seems to me it's exactly that attitude that led people to go after Jack Spencer on his LJ for saying he was sick of RPGs.<br/><br/>Talk about your Geek Social Fallacies! Playing RPGs doesn't mean you belong to <i>anything</i> except the human race. Just because I read novels--or even particular kinds of novels--doesn't mean I belong to some special subculture. A subculture that I may end up quitting someday. As John said, it's not a tour of duty. It's something you do with your time.<br/><br/>I stop playing RPGs everytime a game ends. I start again everytime I start playing another game. Sometimes the time between those two things is a couple of hours or a couple of days. Sometimes it's a week. Sometimes it's a few months. At times in my life, it's been a few years.<br/><br/>But the more I think about it, the more I find the subtext of the question ("When will you quit being one of us?") very, very disturbing.                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote>Honestly, "cold dead hands" doesn't reasonate for me because, like everything else that I do -- everything I do -- I don't consider role-playing part of who I am.</blockquote>
I'm just the opposite.  I've been eyeball-deep in games since I can remember - and not just Candyland - I mean my father schooling me in wargames from a very early age with very chopped-down rules, because I wanted to know what all those chits were for.  I played in my first tournament for <i>Third Reich</i> when I was 13, and got handed my ass. (Operation Sealion was a success in our alternate universe.)<br/><br/>I've been playing D&amp;D for 24 years (good god!), off and on, and for 4-5 of those years, it was literally all that I had in the world.  I hit my awkward stage in 7th grade, and if you're a gawky nerd who reads too much in a middle school full of strapping farmboy, you're in a world of hurt.  <br/><br/>Sure, I've drifted in and out of my participation in the hobby over the years - but I've never 'left'.  I've never stopped rolling one rock or another around in my noggin - be it a campaign world, or Spelljammer alternate rules, or wargaming kinds of stuff.  I've been puddling around with designing games since I first figured out that D&amp;D didn't come with a board - that the board was <i>in your head</i>.  that blew the top of my skull off, and I still haven't found all the pieces.<br/><br/>So it's very much a part of me - very central to my identity.  It'd be harder for me to excise my gamerhood than it was to fall in love with amy one and only male lover.  No, really.  At least he liked Spelljammer.  :^)                        </div>

<p>That is hilarious. I have gamed with Rush fans, so I understand fully. If I have to hear how awesome Geddy Lee is one more time...</p>
<p>I usually try to stop gaming when everyone else starts making motions to go home. I mean, I could just keep on plugging away, but that would be pretty inconsiderate. "Get out of my house!" "Hmm. I'm gonna bring in 'Stubborn as a mule' and use 2d8."</p>
<p>I fully believe RPGs will see a big explosion when we hit the nursing homes. Fuck if I'm gonna sit in a room with a bunch of other people all day and watch TV. Swashbuckling and princesses, seven days a week!</p>

Yeah, that's the flip side of the "part of a social group" thing. "I will never, ever quit playing RPGs" is very much "I define myself by this. This is part of who I am. I refuse to stop drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos and wearing my t-shirt with the d20 on it, because I self-identify as a Gamer. I'm part of the social group, the subculture."<br/><br/>Dammit, I do it, too. I tell people "I'm a Gamer." I may as well tell people "I'm a Reader" or  "I'm a Movie Watcher." *sigh*                        </div>

                            True. :-)<br/><br/>Also, on Clinton's post (and yeah, it sucks that he nuked your comments, I thought they were nice!) I was thinking of my own dad's hobbies, and stuff he used to do and does now.<br/><br/>Before, he used to work a lot. Apparently in high school and college he played the drums.<br/>He golfed for like one summer (when I was small), then got frustrated and quit. That was pretty much my experience with it, too.<br/>He biked for about 5 years, but isn't into it as much: Just rents bikes on vacation, doesn't bike around town.<br/>When I was in scouts, we went camping a lot. At one point he had a tent collection and would go camping 5-6 times a year. These days not so much.<br/><br/>Now, he cooks (hobby-cooks, as in 'takes lessons' and the like) for some 5 years.<br/>He's been sailing for about... 14? 18 years? (single-man catamarans and the like). He says that he doesn't see himself giving up this hobby.<br/>He's been skiing for as long as I have, so about 15 years. Here's the scary thing: He goes regularly these years, to the point where he's scary-good, and I'm still at the level I was 10 years ago. He says he'll stop this when he gets too old to walk properly.<br/>He's been big into strategy and light computer games, and has been playing them regularly since forever (Atari 800 anyone?)<br/><br/>Looking at the above, the hobbies tend to fall into two groups: Stuff that's toyed with for a few years, and stuff that's kinda stuck around since it was started.<br/><br/>However, there's the other big social thing that he does, which is as much a lifestyle as it is a hobby: AA. He's been in for some 23+ years, going several times a week (4 or more times) for the whole evening, or dedicating his weekend days to helping others in it. He also spends days going to the local jail and doing counselling there.  Out of all the stuff he's done for a long time, this I think is the most social, rewarding (it's put him around some really cool people to make friends with), etc. <br/><br/>Now, I won't even try to equate gaming to that, because fuck gaming didn't save my life or anything like that. But if the reward mechanism for social hobbies is any indication, I'm thinking that, sure, I might move on at some point, sure.  Or, maybe not.<br/><br/>I am sure that, way back when, if D&amp;D and White Wolf was the extent of my RPG experience, and I thought that that was all that gaming had to offer, I sure as shit would have dived out. I'd probably be playing board games and MMOs and stuff, or maybe I'd be some Wing Chun master by now. But because of how gaming has changed, matured in areas, and brought me in contact with really cool people, it's something that I can't reasonably see parting with at least in the next 10 years...                        </div>

<p>Some bright boy (or, more likely, girl ... given how our culture labels "empathy" as a feminine trait which ... oy ...) is going to figure out that there's money to be made setting up retirement communities specific to people's non-physical hobbies.  I would fuckin' move to another state to retire in a place that came equipped with gaming tables.  Retire in a fuckin' <strong>CON</strong>, how awesome would that be?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, if some creepy guy who dresses up as Sailor Moon retires there too ... uh ... I might have to reconsider.  Sailor Liver Spot ... that's a stretch for me.  But I think the principle is sound.</p>

<p>Atari 800XL forever! Bought in 1985, the baby's still in operating condition, with the corrosion on the TV adapter and all. I've played Ultima IV on it long before I even knew what an RPG was, and I would've still be using my 800XL had I not misplaced my floppy disk's power supply.</p>
<p>On-topic: I don't know what "stop" playing means, seriously. This boundary is a slippery one to me. I've had breaks from gaming (army years, ugh) and I've had games that ran weekly, or monthly, or one-timers. Last year I GMed once, in a con. There's been some 6-year period during which I hadn't bought a single gaming accessory or supplement. I haven't attended over 5 consecutive local cons. Didn't even know they existed. Does that mean I stopped playing? I don't really think so. Or is it about saying "I shall never play again, it's time to move on to other stuff"? In that case, it sounds weird to me. I never say never.</p>
<p>There will come a time when my second kid will be born, and then I expect a long hiatus. But! Even if I am going to "stop" playing someday, rest assured I will probably go on yapping on RPG forums. There will be no respite, sorry.</p>

                            It's interesting to think about long-time hobbies and interests. Looking at myself and my parents, I see some interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
The only long-time activities that I would say my mother is still doing that she was doing when I was a kid are baking and gardening. She does have some new failry long-time activites: church, geneaology, walking. I guess she also still reads novels.<br/>
<br/>
The only activity I know my dad still does from his childhood is photography. As an adult he started skiing (with my mom, but she quit after a couple years), and I assume will continue until he is physically unable (baring some kind of financial difficulty). As a child he did model railroading, which he didn't even pick up again when I got into the hobby, though he has mentioned doing it occaisionally.<br/>
<br/>
The hobbies I still have from my childhood are RPGs, reading fantasy and science fiction, model railroading (intermitently), and skiing (very intermitently). I would still do caving if I could find a group to do it with (but I sort of dropped out of caving when I started going to church, which was a much more social activity).<br/>
<br/>
As to identiy, sure I consider myself a gamer. I would also consider myself a caver (even though I'm really innactive). I definitely identify as a Unitarian Universalist (church).  I identify as an F&amp;SF fan, though I no longer go to conventions. I identify myself as an AFOL (Adult Fan of LEGO).<br/>
<br/>
I would identify my dad as a skiier and photographer. I would identify my mom as a UU and a cook.<br/>
<br/>
I think we use identity labels (in a good way) when the label helps define who we are and what our interests are. They help find others with similar interests, especially in more casual situations (when we are willing to share those identities).<br/>
