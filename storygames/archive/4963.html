Whatever, just around the end of November a workable format concept for writing a beginner's guide to RPG's coalesced in my mind. Its an idea I've been bouncing around for years, but the shape of the final text was always nebulous till I started scribbling a week ago. In hopes of getting some good criticism, I'm posting my initial outline. Please, feel free to tear it apart pointing out any logical fallacies or glaring omissions. The outline appears in the post following this one, but I'd like to make some commentary first.<br/><br/>I want the final product to be a book I can confidently hand to a person who has never played an rpg before, and know that if they give the book a fair read-through they'll be able to run a game of their own afterward (I'd also like them to enjoy reading the book, if possible).<br/><br/>Lots of gamers, upon hearing that, will point out that many simple and newcomer friendly game systems are already available, so such a book is redundant. I counter that all those systems are good at covering one aspect of play (the rules) but rarely even address the other, in my opinion more important, aspects of rpg's. Things like how to set up a meet socially, how to keep the group engaged, how to interact with the wider hobby or shop for other systems. I know when I rolled my first 3D6, those where the things I was most clueless about and could have used the most help with. There will be a rule system in the book, but it will be deliberately derivative and non-innovative, built only to accomodate a few sessions of play illustrating key aspects before the players move on to a more substantial system.<br/><br/>I'd like community support, either here or elsewhere, putting this together, but I'm not sure how to go about that. Mainly I'll probably do it like this, every time I pound out a piece of it I'll flip it into the public eye and see what the crowd shouts. Ideas for more refined approaches are appreciated, but I'm unimpressed with blogs (I think they breed insularity) and am not pursuing any sort of timetable. It gets done when it gets done. Also, this is not-for-profit; I'd like the final product offered as a PDF and at-cost hardcopy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111392/#Comment_111392" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T13:13:55+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  1:13PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 1:15PM by E.T.Smith.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Parts I'm still foggy on should be obvious, but otherwise please ask for clarifications when wanted.\n<blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction </span>(1 page)<br/>Why I'm writing this, what I hope to accomplish<br/>Why I want you to become a player of TTRPG's<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a TTRPG?</span><br/>[Dramatic in Media Res]<br/>Origins<br/>Basic Elements<br/>The Inherent Conundrum<br/>The subculture<br/>Development of the hobby<br/>Current state of the hobby (think positive!)<br/>What's Good about TTRPG's<br/>What's Bad about TTRPG's<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Play</span><br/>The Social Gathering<br/>The participants: your friends<br/>Divvying up responsibility: who plays, who GM's<br/>The play environment<br/>A note on refreshments<br/>The Rules<br/>The Characters<br/>The Adventure<br/>The Beginning, middle and end<br/>Making it a series<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Sample Rules</span><br/>Design Parameters<br/>[Standard stuff (chargen, actions, etc)]<br/>How these rules work, knowing their biases and when they won't do what you want<br/>Modifying the rules<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creating &amp; Playing Characters</span><br/>[Stuff]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparing &amp; Running Adventures</span><br/>[Stuff]<br/>Planning &amp; running a series<br/>Example Adventure 1<br/>Example Adventure 2<br/>Example Adventure 3<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moving Beyond this Book</span><br/>The TTRPG community<br/>Hobby vs Industry, and going DIY<br/>Online play (I'm nearly clueless about this!)<br/>What to look for in a game system<br/>10-15 suggested beginner friendly game systems<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Index</span> </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111411/#Comment_111411" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T14:43:25+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  2:43PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 3:00PM by Larry.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have about ten percent positive things to say and ninety percent negative things to say.

I suppose I'm looking for some validation, yes, but only in the sense that the project is at least conceptually worthwhile. The outline is just the first plan that came to mind, and I expect to tear it apart and rebuild it a couple times.<br/><br/>I should point out that this isn't intended as the "Story-Game 101" whoss absence I bemoaned here a few months back. Rather this is about just getting people into basic tabletop gaming first; a lot of the high-end design goals and sacred-cow slaughtering that get bandied about here just don't figure into my goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111437/#Comment_111437" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T16:24:52+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  4:24PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks OK.

Throwing stuff up for various communities to critique is going to be a cacaphony of conflicting voices. I look at your outline, for example, and think "he's looking at the wrong stuff and making assumptions" - like, what's A GM? What's an adventure? What's a character? All assumptions that can be questioned in the broadest sense. I typically don't play games with the first two, and sometimes the last one is very fluid. But if you want to get a 12-year-old up to speed on playing, say, GURPS, awesome. So if your intent is something that truly represents the range of the hobby, that's a different ball of wax, right?<br/><br/>Anyway, expect a lot of flack from all quarters!

Here goes:  This isn't an outline.  These are quick notes jotted down about what you think should be in a book about this subject.  You're a bit far away from your outline.  In this early stage, develop your ideas more before working on the structure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>There will be a rule system in the book, but it will be deliberately derivative and non-innovative, built only to accomodate a few sessions of play illustrating key aspects before the players move on to a more substantial system.</blockquote>\nGiven your goal, can you tell us how inventing your own system and detailing it will help this?  I mean, really unpack that, because that's a lot of work in the writing, playtesting and rewriting department -- especially in playtesting with completely new-to-the-hobby people, which can be difficult as those folks aren't often easy to get to playtest something and as they playtest more and more, they stop being as useful a pool of your book's target audience (since they're learning how to role-play from your interactions and not as much from your text).<br/><br/>If your answer to my question is "I don't know" right now, or feels vague, make something up on the spot -- you can always decide against it later.<br/><br/>There is one element that stood out:\n<blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>(1 page)<br/>Why I'm writing this, what I hope to accomplish<br/>Why I want you to become a player of TTRPG's</blockquote>\nWrite this down.  Write it all down right now, because you're thinking about it.  Don't include anything like it in your text, lest you look too evangelical.  Or, if you must keep it in, think of your reader -- they don't care why you want something, so tell them why *they* should want it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111443/#Comment_111443" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T16:50:35+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  4:50PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 4:54PM by Mcdaldno.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (x-posted with the Morningstar and the Macklin)<br/><br/>ET, the following post is an attack on your base idea. I'm not judging you or calling YOU out, but I don't like the idea.<br/><br/><br/>I think that there are a lot of really volatile section headings, and other outright dumb ones. I think that if you do this, you should scrap:<br/><b>Origins, Subculture, The Development of the Hobby, The State of the Hobby</b><br/>I think what this will be is an exercise in typecasting. Trying to systematically organize a diverse creative endeavour will either lead to incoherent jumping about, or centralizing a single component of the scene. D&amp;D-centric is an example of a potential pitfall. I don't think there's a solid way to address both of those issues at the same time. Also, you run the extreme risk of telling people that something doesn't exist, in the process of telling them the scope of what DOES exist. That's potentially very insulting and marginalizing to certain groups.<br/><br/>All in all, these sections seem like a bad idea, and especially a bad idea to lead a book with. I think it would be far better to say "There are like a billion different roleplaying communities. Some are very focused on rules and gaming systems, and some are all about telling freeform stories. Some are male-centric and play extended campaigns. Some are all about convention gaming. There are a thousand million different roleplaying communities." And end the entire section there. Otherwise, what you're doing is running the risk of reinforcing stereotypes, confusing someone with a boring history lesson that makes the hobby seem less immediate and now, and centralizing a certain school of roleplaying at the expense of all others.<br/><br/><b>Running Adventures</b><br/>Um... by this point in the table of contents it strikes me how very D&amp;D centric this thing is. It now sounds like you're writing a book about "Long form, GM-driven, adventure tabletop roleplaying games that are rules heavy". <br/><br/>Most games don't follow an adventure structure, and formulizing it is a very One True Wayist approach.<br/><br/><b>Hobby vs Industry, and going DIY</b><br/>So, you're going to take this awful dichotomy which doesn't make sense and divides good people (see 207 post monstrosity on this forum right now), and hardcode it into new people so they see it and further it?

Imagine that you could go into the future, after you've written this book, and send it to yourself when you starting gaming.  Tell me everything you wish this book would have taught your younger self.  Get specific, get thorough, and be verbose.  Unpack it all.  Don't do this in ten minutes, but take some serious time to get it all out onto paper (or whatever you use).<br/><br/>Then talk about how your future book helped your past self out with those issues.

I think that if you do this, you should scrap:<br/><b>Origins, Subculture, The Development of the Hobby, The State of the Hobby</b><br/>I think what this will be is an exercise in typecasting. Trying to systematically organize a diverse creative endeavour will either lead to incoherent jumping about, or centralizing a single component of the scene. D&amp;D-centric is an example of a potential pitfall. I don't think there's a solid way to address both of those issues at the same time. Also, you run the extreme risk of telling people that something doesn't exist, in the process of telling them the scope of what DOES exist. That's potentially very insulting and marginalizing to certain groups.<br/><br/>Valid concerns. But I don't see how I can reasonably avoid the subjects either. I mean, the assumption is that the reader will be potentially looking to engage with the hobby, so its not very helpful to avoid mentioning everyone for fear of leaving someone out. However, there's no need for hand wringing because the approach you describe below...\n<blockquote>I think it would be far better to say "There are like a billion different roleplaying communities. Some are very focused on rules and gaming systems, and some are all about telling freeform stories. Some are male-centric and play extended campaigns. Some are all about convention gaming. There are a thousand million different roleplaying communities." And end the entire section there. Otherwise, what you're doing is running the risk of reinforcing stereotypes, confusing someone with a boring history lesson that makes the hobby seem less immediate and now, and centralizing a certain school of roleplaying at the expense of all others.</blockquote>\n...is the approach I want to take. Basically, tell them which ways North, what signposts to look for, and let them figure it out from there. I have no ambition to write a fifty page chapter covering everything from 70's dungeon-delving to the latest thing.\n<blockquote><b>Running Adventures</b><br/>Um... by this point in the table of contents it strikes me how very D&amp;D centric this thing is. It now sounds like you're writing a book about "Long form, GM-driven, adventure tabletop roleplaying games that are rules heavy".<br/>Most games don't follow an adventure structure, and formulizing it is a very One True Wayist approach.</blockquote>\nI think this will become a major point of contention with this community. Last I checked, most table-top games <i>are</i> D&amp;D, or other forms of "long form, GM-driven, adventure tabletop roleplaying games that are rules heavy." The dominance of that play style is inarguable, and pushing another is just another form of One True Wayism. Having said that, I intend to present that play style as "this is how most people do this sort of thing, and it seems to work, but don't assume its the only way to go." I also intend to disdain location-and-encounter based adventure preparation and instead suggest one based on character drives. Because, going from the "if I only knew then" premise, the latter form was much more fun and easier then the old one.\n<blockquote><b>Hobby vs Industry, and going DIY</b><br/>So, you're going to take this awful dichotomy which doesn't make sense and divides good people (see 207 post monstrosity on this forum right now), and hardcode it into new people so they see it and further it? No.</blockquote>\nI'm afraid I'm unaware of this controversey.

All assumptions that can be questioned in the broadest sense. I typically don't play games with the first two, and sometimes the last one is very fluid.

The community here offers one perspective, and I'll try others as well, and mix the insights that seem to go well together.<br/><br/>Those assumptions (GM, adventures) I'm planning to define in that <i>Basic Elements</i> section in the "What is a TTRPG" chapter.

I agonized over it a bit, and finally decided that I can't realistically cover every direction a newcomer might go in, from hardcore mini-fig wargaming to utterly esoteric collaborative narratives. I can't even cover most of them. So I'm going to set a single, openly arbitrary course that aims right for the middle ground. Basically, offering a methodology that is most likely to work for most people, while also informing that alternatives exist. Also, giving them a base of knowledge that will make the hobby, if not known, than at least approachable.    \n<blockquote>Anyway, expect a lot of flack from all quarters!

I implied too much by calling it otherwise.\n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>There will be a rule system in the book, but it will be deliberately derivative and non-innovative, built only to accomodate a few sessions of play illustrating key aspects before the players move on to a more substantial system.</blockquote>\nGiven your goal, can you tell us how inventing your own system and detailing it will help this?  I mean, really unpack that...</blockquote>\nFirst, because it will be easier on the novice to offer an integral system instead of telling them to go buy and master another book. Second, to provide an at-hand source of examples through a system tailored for providing examples. However, I should probably rethink whether I can achieve the same benefits with existing well-tested system. \n<blockquote>...that's a lot of work in the writing, playtesting and rewriting department -- especially in playtesting with completely new-to-the-hobby people, which can be difficult as those folks aren't often easy to get to playtest something and as they playtest more and more, they stop being as useful a pool of your book's target audience (since they're learning how to role-play from your interactions and not as much from your text).</blockquote>\nYeah, that's an issue I'm not sure how to deal with yet either.

Write it all down right now, because you're thinking about it.  Don't include anything like it in your text, lest you look too evangelical.

Just talk about how to play the games. Advice for players in different situations would be useful, I think--things like, "how to make your character unique/memorable" or "how to narrate interesting adversity for other players' characters". Those could potentially apply to almost any game you're playing.<br/><br/>I AM curious about "why I want you to know about TTRPGs" and what you think the "Inherent Conundrum" is. Would you care to outline what will go in those sections?<br/><br/>Finally, dealing with GM/player issues might be less clear-cut than you think if you're going to talk about online play. MMORPGs don't have a "GM" at all, and much of the other "online roleplaying" is based collaborative storytelling or some other form of freeform roleplay. Given the era we've entered, they're probably worth seriously discussing, particularly since both can forms can take place in tabletop roleplaying, as well.<br/><br/>Finally, just because most of the roleplaying plays D&amp;D doesn't mean they all do it the same way. In my own D&amp;D experience (which was very "traditional", as far as we could tell) we only rarely had any prepared "adventures" and occasionally just ignored a whole bunch of rules or even totally changed the nature of the game. For instance:<br/><br/>-We all played "monsters", and fought against group after group of heroes until we died. We, as the players, designed the dungeon and its traps together, without showing the GM.<br/><br/>-A few times we just sat around the table pretending we were our characters in a bar (or an a long, boring space journey) and told each other stories in-character. No game mechanics involved, and the GM didn't say a word unless speaking through an NPC who was present. Everyone had a great time.<br/><br/>I would imagine that most "traditional" gaming groups do stuff like this, even if they don't realize it. Even playing an "evil campaign" is a bit of a subversion of what D&amp;D gameplay is supposed to be like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
