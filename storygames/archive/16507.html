One of the hard moves allows you to take a String on a PC (on behalf of an NPC). The Principles, in the meantime, tell you to misdirect and never speak your move's name. Now, sometimes it's obviously silly not to tell your players about the specific move you are doing (as when you inflict harm or trigger a Darker Self transformation). But with Strings, I suppose you could just describe the in-fiction emotional power the NPC gains without explicitly saying that they take a String.<br/><br/>So I'm just wondering how you all handle it. Do you / does your MC tell the players when you take a String on them (in addition to describing it in the fiction)? Do you just mark it down for yourself and only give them the fiction? My tendency would be towards the former, but I'd like to know how this moment works for you guys who have actually experienced it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378093/#Comment_378093" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T11:46:32+00:00" title="May 13, 2012 11:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Vlad's an NPC, Betty's a PC.<br/>You decide to have Vlad take a String on Betty, as your hard move.<br/><br/>The misdirect part is easy: you just make it seem like Vlad got the String on Betty as a result of fictional circumstances. "But Vlad doesn't move out of her way. In fact, he repositions himself to dominate the entire door-frame. He's using his body to tell Betty that he's got all the power in this sitch. And it seems like he's getting his point across."<br/><br/>The never speak it's name part is pretty simple too: just don't say "I'm taking a String on someone." Don't give people reason to believe that you picked an option off a list. But in the case of triggering a specific player mechanic (harm, Strings, Darkest Self), it's fine to say that. So, continuing on with the Vlad/Betty example: "After a little while, he'll step aside. Once he's given himself the satisfaction. But now he's got some additional power over you, in the form of a String."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC" title="DavidTC"><img alt="DavidTC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">DavidTC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378094/#Comment_378094" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T12:03:29+00:00" title="May 13, 2012 12:03PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Joe">@Joe</a>: so you intended "never speak its name" in a very literal sense, as in, never read the name of the move, not, never explicitly talk about the mechanical terms you are engaging. That sounds like the most reasonable procedure here.

These games are played with a semi-open hand, and it wouldn't be tremendously fair if you invoked mechanics that directly affect PCs without telling them so.  If you think about it, it's not too far removed from something as pointedly straightforward as AW's "inflict harm (as established)".  Presume your guy tries to seduce some girl and you blow the roll+hot, so the MC decides:<br/><br/>"She's had enough of your bullshit.  She doesn't say as much, but you kind of put two and two together once she's finished removing her foot from your testicles, to the tune of 1-harm."<br/><br/>Mechanics -&gt; fiction -&gt; mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
