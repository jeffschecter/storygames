Capable contestants have been flown in across the world in order to compete at being the celebrity\u2019s next top investigator of strange.</i><br/><br/><b>Concept:</b><br/>Leveraging internet services such as Twitch.tv and Strawpoll, I desire to hack InSpectres into a hilarious RPG game show. I picture a last-group-standing competition where our contestants will be teaming up to solve paranormal problems based on viewer feedback. Our host and judge, along with viewer rankings, will determine after each round who stays and who goes with our weekly MVPs earning perks. You play until it\u2019s down to 3 or 4 people left. These finalists will then compete in the Final round to determine the victor<br/><br/>So, mechanically, this game takes the TV show dial of the original game up to 11. InSpectres's "TV confessional" mechanic now has a home with an actual audience who can vote on missions and introduce complications. <br/><br/><b>Implementation:</b><br/><br/>1.Removal of Job titles/descriptions. Players are all contestants.<br/>2.Franchise dice still determine a mission\u2019s success, but nothing more.<br/>3.Who is this season\u2019s host?<br/>4.The main office is the Game Show floor/stage/arena. What\u2019s it look like?<br/>5.All contestants share the same \u201chouse\u201d between missions. How are the rooms separated if at all?<br/>6.Contestants are assigned \u201cteams\u201d to accomplish missions.<br/>7.Each week\u2019s missions are \u201cthematic\u201d (What is the theme?)<br/>8.Missions are voted on by the Internet Via polls (Teams do separate missions tied together thematically)<br/>9.A Mission behaves like regular Inspectres play with the following changes:<br/>_____a.Twists will be introduced at times by the \u201cviewers\u201d in forms of Boons/Banes<br/><br/>10. After each mission concludes, the team who got the fewest franchise dice loses is in danger of elimination.<br/>_____a.The lowest scoring team will be judged on a combination of the following:<br/>----------i.(GM) Host\u2019s opinion (Critiques/\u201ddid contestants stick to the theme/rules of the mission?\u201d)<br/>----------ii.Celebrity Judge\u2019s Opinion (Critiques/\u201ddid contestants stick to the theme/rules of the mission?\u201d)<br/>----------iii.Viewer Polls (Popular opinion)    <br/>_____b.The contestant with the lowest opinion is eliminated from the competition.<br/><br/>11.Contestants get \u201crefreshed\u201d after missions.<br/>12.MVP contestants get a \u201cperk\u201d for the next missions.<br/>13.Eliminated contestant\u2019s players come back next week as a celebrity judge?<br/><br/><b>Shape of Play:</b><br/><br/>1. Some sort of house drama/recap<br/>2. Players file in to hear this week\u2019s mission, theme, and celebrity judge.<br/>3. Players are broken up into teams for a mission. (A and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/><br/>4. Mission A begins. (What do Mission B players do? Join twitch chat in voting or wrecking plans in confessionals/playing as ghosts?) Missions play nearly identical to the typical InSpectres game.<br/>3. Mission A Ends<br/>4. Mission B begins<br/>5. Mission B ends<br/>6. Judgement time<br/><br/>Scattered among my implementations and shape of play are my questions and thoughts on how to make this game show as fun as possible. I'd really love to hear what other's think would be fun to see.<br/><br/>So there you have it. I am a newbie to the Story Games forums and game design in general and I hope I did not break any rules posting this!

Yes, I was thinking the Twitch Streaming is a necessary mechanical part of the game. This whole concept kind of took off after reading InSpectres and thinking, <i>Hey what if there was an actual audience in this?</i><br/><br/>I picture the GM and the 8 players would be on a video conferencing service (Skype/roll20/google hangouts/whatever) being streamed on Twitch. Players are InSpectre characters who are contestants on this episodic game show. The GM is the "host" of the broadcast. The Twitch audience (via Twitch Chat and the Strawpoll voting website) will also be <i>active participants</i> and helping craft the story. Right now I see chat contributing on mission/team selection, complications during the mission, and deciding which contestant is eliminated each round.\n<blockquote>Sounds challenging but fascinating.<br/><br/>How important is it to have two teams in every "episode"?<br/><br/>Is there some kind of real "audience" and/or real judges, or will the players not in a particular mission act as judges and audience?<br/><br/>(I suppose one way would be to post recaps here on Story Games and for posters to act as audience and/or judges between sessions.)</blockquote>\nThank you, Paul. I'm not entirely sure if the 2 teams are necessary. I'm attached to that notion right only because TV shows like <i>Top Chef</i> do that. Something to do with the experience of trying to win, but also being forced on a team not of your choosing? I will think about this more critically today.<br/><br/>Additionally, there will be a real "audience" and real "judges" in this game. This is done via Twitch.tv streaming. Viewers have the opportunity to tune in AND influence the story. <br/><br/>One aspect the audience has control over is, during missions, there can be twists voted on by the audience somewhat similar to <i>The Hunger Games</i> or the video game <i>Party Hard</i>.  Another aspect the audience has control over is that they have the final say on who gets "eliminated" each round. <br/><br/>So yeah, the audience is sort of what this game will be about. Not only do you have to be the best InSpectre, but you also have to woo your audience. Without popular support, you are doomed.<br/><br/>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/><br/>I have been thinking about this more and I may have an idea on what to do with the mission team who is no longer on the mission.<br/><br/>A very important part of bad TV competitions is the downtime drama, right? The budding romances, the stolen/broken TV, or how one guy doesn't pick up after himself. <br/><br/>So what if, during the mission for team A, team B has a sort of "downtime" phase? So, what if the downtime group could not only watch the active group in a sort of greek play style commentary, but also have whacky hijinks at home? I'm still brainstorming how to mechanically reflect this desire. Right now, the simplest implementation I have is having the "downtime team" come up with the complications of the other team's mission in a sort of "anti-confessional" and then have Twitch Chat vote on the ones they come up with.<br/><br/>I'm toying with the idea of incentivizing players to do what Twitch Chat wants you to do, usually at the cost of status among fellow players. Something like bonds, AW's hX, even WW Wrestling RPG's Heat.<br/><br/>Lastly, going back to the Game Show experience I'm trying to evoke, perhaps the structure of the game should proceed as follows:<br/><br/>1.) Session Start. (Previously on America's Next Top InSpectre...) Establish this week's setting and theme. (Welcome to the 4th of July special of America's Next Top InSpectre. This week we're on the a Nimitz class supercarrier in the pacific!)<br/>2.) A Free-For-All competition to win elimination immunity this round. (Judged by Celebrity Judge)<br/>3.) The main competition's team selection (Team A/Team <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/>.<br/>4.) Team A goes on a mission (Goal: Solve problem and earn as many franchise dice as possible)<br/>_____a.)Team B begins Downtime Phase<br/>_____b.)Twitch Chat votes on mucking up team A's mission (Possibly Team B's downtime as well?)<br/>5.) Team A mission ends/Team B goes on a different mission.<br/>_____a.)Team A begins Downtime Phase<br/>_____b.)Twitch Chat votes on mucking up team B's mission (Possibly Team A's downtime as well?)<br/>6.) The Lowest franchise dice earning team is judged<br/>7.) Twitch Chat votes on which member of the losing team gets eliminated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448692/#Comment_448692" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-23T02:25:22+00:00" title="September 23, 2015  2:25AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that's a very interesting (and ambitious) project!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
