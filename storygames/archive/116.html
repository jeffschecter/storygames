                    Here's the deal: <br/>1. I have a Little Idea, detailed below, that I'm casting out here for collective design, a la <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=47&amp;page=1#Item_36" rel="nofollow">Giant Imperial Robot Haiku</a>. Bread upon the waters, and all that.<br/>2. However, unlike GIRH, I will serve as the editor/developer of this thread. This essentially gives me veto power over off-tone, derailing contributions. (My contributions can be vetoed by the joint resolution of three other participants.)<br/>3. A post should focus on <i>either</i> rules or setting (though the effect of a rule on setting or setting bit expanded into rules are kosher).<br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">4. If we get something fun and publishable out of this, I know a guy who's a game publisher. . . </span><br/><i>EDITED TO ADD: 4. After you've added your post, you cannot add again until at least two others have done so. Try not to contradict something already written. </i><br/>5.

<h1>Roadsigns &amp; Ley Lines</h1>
<b>Inspirado:</b> <i>Knightriders</i>, Mad Max movies, Tim Powers' <i>Last Call</i>, <i>Easy Rider</i>, <i>Devlin</i>, <i>Street Hawk</i>, <i>Demolition Alley</i>, <i>The Dark Tower</i>, <i>Six-String Samurai</i>.<br/><b>Game Blurb:</b> Between the last outposts of Civilization, the great road-ships sail on rubber wheels. They shift the goods and people needed to keep the Last Cities alive. Without the road-ships, humanity will die.<br/><br/>Of course, there are those street pirates and road barbarians who don't care about greater humanity, seeking only supplies for their tribe (at best) or plunder for themselves (at worst). They raid the road-ships, take the crews and passengers for ransom, and loot and pillage the small hamlets along the road-currents.<br/><br/>Only the loyal knights of the King of the Road can protect them. Blessed with the king's magic (or is it technology? does it matter?) and mounted on their Motor Steeds, the Knights guard the merchants, couriers, and pilgrims who journey into the Dusty Waste on the road-sea. <br/><br/>Are you willing to stand against the cutlasses of the Brotherhood of Pirates, the electro-lance of the Black Knight of Blackrock, and the strange magics of the Sorceress of Sixty-Six in defense of Civilization?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><br/>(Okay, that's what I've got, other than the following :<br/>1. There should be a limited number of common attributes or pools or stats that all characters should share. I'm fond of Physical, Mental, Social, and Technomagical as the core set.<br/>2. The system should be <i>dead simple</i>.<br/>3. I would like there to be either no GM or everyone GMs -- in parallel or in serial, either is fine.)<br/><br/>Have at it.<br/><br/><br/>CU                </div>

<i>Attributes are assigned scores by . . . </i>building the character like a vehicle.  That means you pick a character's Motor (his driving passion/motivation), Chassis (physique), and Interior.  The different kinds of parts give scores for each attribute that then combine for the final numbers when added to a base 1 for each attribute.  The parts also indicate character traits, and the Motor needs to be further defined toward a particular goal.<br/><br/>For example, a Rage Motor would give two points for Brawn and one for Bravado, a Bentley Chassis gives one point each to Brains, Bravado and Brass, and a Luxury Interior gives two points to Bravado and one to Brass; add that to basic scores of 1 each and you get Brawn 3, Brains 2, Bravado 5 and Brass 3. You also know now that your character is driven by rage, built handsome and resilient, and likes to indulge.<br/><br/>The Ride is created by. . .                        </div>

                            ...the same process - each combination of Motor, Chassis, and Interior provides three points that are combined with the initial attributes.  <br/><br/>For a Ride, the attributes need a little explanation.  They are identical - Brawn, Brains, Bravado and Brass - because a Ride is a living thing.  A Knight's mechanical mount is imbued with magical power; it's consciousness is an amalgam of the tiny motive spirits that reside in every part.  A Ride can reason and - with a high enough score - even communicate.  Similarly, if the scores dictate it, Rides can do all kinds of crazy things, like drive themselves, or parley with bandits, or use magic themselves.  The fact that a Ride is really a composite personality has a dangerous down-side, though, namely ...                        </div>

which is if the Knight orders the Ride to destroy the Knight him/herself, in a matter that runs counter to the Knight's Motor.  At this point the bond between Knight and Ride is damaged, and the Ride becomes a free agent.  It is possible for the Knight to regain his Ride, but the bond will never be the same, and the Ride will find it possible to resist the Knight.  If the Knight does not regain his Ride, or if the Knight releases the Ride, the Ride becomes a free agent and may be claimed by another Knight.<br/>

<h1>Roadsigns &amp; Ley Lines</h1>
<b>Inspirado:</b> Knightriders, Mad Max movies, Tim Powers' Last Call, Easy Rider, Devlin, Street Hawk, Demolition Alley, The Dark Tower, Six-String Samurai.<br/><b>Game Blurb:</b> Between the last outposts of Civilization, the great road-ships sail on rubber wheels. They shift the goods and people needed to keep the Last Cities alive. Without the road-ships, humanity will die.<br/><br/>Of course, there are those street pirates and road barbarians who don't care about greater humanity, seeking only supplies for their tribe (at best) or plunder for themselves (at worst). They raid the road-ships, take the crews and passengers for ransom, and loot and pillage the small hamlets along the road-currents.<br/><br/>Only the loyal knights of the King of the Road can protect them. Blessed with the King's magic (or is it technology? does it matter?) and mounted on their Motor Steeds, the Knights guard the merchants, couriers, and pilgrims who journey into the Dusty Waste on the road-sea. <br/><br/>Are you willing to stand against the cutlasses of the Brotherhood of Pirates, the electro-lance of the Black Knight of Blackrock, and the strange magics of the Sorceress of Sixty-Six in defense of Civilization?<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Character Generation</h2>
Every player creates a Knight for themself, and a Ride for another player. During the game, they play the Ride during chases, rumbles, long hauls, and duels when appropriate - the bond between Knight and Ride is always symbiotic and, in some cases, magical. Nobody can coax the performance out of a Ride that her Knight - her true driver - can. <br/><br/>Every character (Knight, Ride, or other) in the game has the same attributes, which are:<br/><br/><b>Brawn:</b> Physical strength, nimbleness, and toughness.<br/><b>Brains:</b> Mental smarts, strength of will, and education.<br/><b>Bravado:</b> Social skill and understanding; also rank and status.<br/><b>Brass:</b> Talent in using magic and technology.<br/><br/>For each of these attributes, characters pick 1 thing related to that attribute that they're good at (<i>Forte</i>), and 1 thing related to that attribute that they're bad at (<i>Flaw</i>). <br/><br/>Attributes are assigned scores by building the character like a vehicle. That means you pick a character's <i>Motor</i> (his driving passion/motivation), <i>Chassis</i> (physique), and <i>Interior</i>. The different kinds of parts give scores for each attribute that then combine for the final numbers when added to a base 1 for each attribute. The parts also indicate character traits, and the Motor needs to be further defined toward a particular goal.<br/><br/>For example, a Rage Motor would give two points for Brawn and one for Bravado, a Bentley Chassis gives one point each to Brains, Bravado and Brass, and a Luxury Interior gives two points to Bravado and one to Brass; add that to basic scores of 1 each and you get Brawn 3, Brains 2, Bravado 5 and Brass 3. You also know now that your character is driven by rage, built handsome and resilient, and likes to indulge.<br/><br/><i>[EDITOR'S NOTE: We need several Motors, Chassis, and Interiors.]</i>
<h3>The Knight's Ride</h3>
The Knight's Ride is created by the same process -- each combination of Motor, Chassis, and Interior provides three points that are combined with the initial attributes. <br/><br/>For a Ride, the attributes need a little explanation. They are identical -- Brawn, Brains, Bravado and Brass -- because a Ride is a living thing. A Knight's mechanical mount is imbued with magical power; it's consciousness is an amalgam of the tiny motive spirits that reside in every part. A Ride can reason and - with a high enough score - even communicate. Similarly, if the scores dictate it, Rides can do all kinds of crazy things, like drive themselves, or parley with bandits, or use magic themselves. The fact that a Ride is really a composite personality has a dangerous down-side, though, namely [that] a Ride is always subordinate to it's Knight. If a Knight commands his or her Ride to do something, it does it -- no matter what -- even this could lead to something the Ride doesn't wish to happen, the betrayal of the King of the Road, or the Ride's destruction. <br/><br/>However, there is balance: as the Ride is under the mystic command of the Knight, the Knight has mystic responsibility and accountability for his or her Ride. If a Ride does something that leads to problems (usually, in lieu of proscriptions from its Knight), it's the Knight that's held to be at fault, even if he or she knew nothing of what the Ride did or was planning to do. Furthermore, the Knight psychically shares all damage (physical, mental, social, or magical) that his or her Ride suffers.<br/><br/>There is one very narrow chance for a Ride to rebel against its Knight, which is if the Knight orders the Ride to destroy the Knight him/herself, in a matter that runs counter to the Knight's Motor. At this point the bond between Knight and Ride is damaged, and the Ride becomes a free agent. It is possible for the Knight to regain his Ride, but the bond will never be the same, and the Ride will find it possible to resist the Knight. If the Knight does not regain his Ride, or if the Knight releases the Ride, the Ride becomes a free agent and may be claimed by another Knight. <br/><br/><i>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Any differences between cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other land-based vehicles as Rides?]</i><br/><br/><hr/>

<b>EDITORIAL</b><br/><br/>Hm. Just realized that the 20 trumps could be represented by the court cards plus aces in a standard poker deck. Including a correspondence chart in the text could help. <br/><br/>I'm not sure about the viability of PDF'd playing cards for home printing. Anyone have anecdotal info?<br/><br/>Also, and this is harsh: despite the coolness of the mechanic that's shaping up, does a card-based Rummy system fit the game?<br/><br/>I'm starting a separate thread to pull more of the DEV comments over, leaving moderation on this purely EDITORIAL.<br/><br/>Game design in practice, baby.<br/><br/><b>[CU</b> </div>
