I want there to be a good incentive to cooperate but not an easy/obvious choice (like whether or not to take an extra card for fifty cents when you get a 4 in Baseball).  I thought I'd turn to Story Games for some help, if not for the full game, then for some brainstorming.<br/><br/>I think I want each player to have 2 hole cards and one revealed card.  And also some community cards, maybe even a standard Flop, Turn, and River as in Hold'Em.  It needs to be able to play up to 10 players.  I have the seed of an idea where players have "store windows" where they have "wares" in form of cards.  I don't know whether they pay money or cards for the wares though, or how much control the seller will have over whom they can sell to.<br/><br/>If anyone would like to take a crack at coming up with their own Kwanzaa poker game, here are the seven principals:<br/><br/>Umoja (Unity) To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation and race.<br/><br/>Kujichagulia (Self-Determination) To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves and speak for ourselves.<br/><br/>Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility) To build and maintain our community together and make our brothers' and sisters' problems our problems and to solve them together.<br/><br/>Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics) To build and maintain our own stores, shops and other businesses and to profit from them together.<br/><br/>Nia (Purpose) To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.<br/><br/>Kuumba (Creativity) To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.<br/><br/>Imani (Faith) To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247069/#Comment_247069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T08:57:08+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  8:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2009 8:57AM by lachek.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know poker.<br/><br/>But, dude, what a fantastic design challenge!

S'why I posted it even though it's Poker.<br/><br/>Another Ujamaa seed: your "community" is defined as the player to your left, and you benefit in some way if they stay in the hand and if you maintain a "store" together, a "store" being a community card between you.  The betting structure needs to encourage most people to stay in, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247095/#Comment_247095" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T10:42:04+00:00" title="December 16, 2009 10:42AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once per hand a player can swap revealed cards with a neighbor, forming a poker cooperative.

Unless you change that, or obfuscate it, any time any players cooperate they will be doing so at the direct expense of those players not in their cooperative. Poker, unlike life, doesn't natively have a huge influx of resources from the sky. Here are two ways to get around this huge obstacle:<br/><br/>- Make the choice to play the poker variant a negative expected-value choice, but the actual play a positive-sum game. The rewards for cooperation are produced by the prior agreement to essentially burn money sans cooperation. For example, each hand all players must ante 2 BBs to the fire. During play, any time you take an action to stay in (call or raise, but not fold) you may reveal all of your hidden cards to let everyone except you take 1 BB from the fire-ante. If there are not enough BBs in the fire-ante for everyone but you to get one, you may not reveal. After the hand, if someone revealed at least once, start a new hand with the remaining fire-ante still on the table; otherwise throw the fire-ante money into a fire and watch it burn, then start a new hand.<br/><br/>- Each hand, whoever is first to act is the Cruel World. Deal that player an extra face-down card. If she wins any of the pot, each other player must give her 2 BBs.<br/>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
