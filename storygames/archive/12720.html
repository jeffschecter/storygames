Only three of us, though, but for most games, that's enough. We've recruited others for certain games, but none of them stuck like the rest of us three "core" members. No matter, for most games, it works. Though often we are wanting for a fourth...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I digress. We've been playing to a rythm of 1 game session per week,approimately. We've skipped several, and added a few mid-week.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, we've been trying out games we'd never played before. We'd play them once, either as a one-shot or as a short campaign (which would usually finish before the end). And then we'd put the game down, and pick up another for the next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's great! Of the thirteen games we've played together in the past 12 months, there were nine which I've had never played before! That's very neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I realize we've often gone for quantity over quality. Many games were not given a fair chance to shine at our table. Others provided a good experience, but we still put them aside for another time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I still have over a dozen unplayed games on my shelf (more counting what I have on my hard drive).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided, for one thing, to not buy any new games for a while. (Actually, I said a year, but that's not very realistic...) Also, I'm going to try and play fewer games, each of them longer and more often. That means not trying as many new games (new games I already have) as last year, probably, but still a few. It would be way too frustrating not to. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I wonder how much my gaming habits vary from my fellow gamers.

When it is your turn, you get buy-in (if anybody isn't happy with your choice you pick a different game) and GM or facilitate or whatever. Right now we're playing How We Came To Live Here and before that it was Diaspora, etc. The only game I can recall playing more than once is PTA, although I may be forgetting something.<br><br>The other group has seven people. Also more or less weekly, usually down at least one participant - the rule is if two can't make it we either skip a week or do something else. We used to eat together but don't anymore, although we share snack-bringing duties. This group also rotates through games, but we have a more limited assortment - primarily TSOY and PTA these days, with the occasional experiment. We pitch short campaign ideas twice a year and our games tend to run eight or more sessions. This group has been together for like ten years.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286010/#Comment_286010" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T04:58:37+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  4:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's like 8 people here that I would consider part of our gaming group. However, three of them are absent most of the year and one is a complete casual player, of whom we don't expect any investment. So it boils down to four regulars. Depending on who shows up we have various games going now, and try to find something ongoing to play with the people present or kick off something new. At the moment we have a Vampire, BattleTech, WHFRP2 and D&amp;D games going, with Burning Wheel, Apocalypse World, Mouse Guard, Rogue Trader and Cthulhu pending (with a chance of becoming regulars). In between we get to play stuff like Lady Blackbird, Ghost/Echo, Montsegur, my playtests and other one-shots. If there's no RPG game going for the people present, we usually end up playing one of our many boardgames (recently: Twilight Imperium, Game of Thrones, Catan, Hero Quest, Battlestar Galactica).<br><br>This has been going on only for the past few months, when we managed to "get back" two of our absent gamers, and began to re-evaluate our gaming times, scheduling, etc. I made a roster of people present and we cross-reference to see what we should play. Before that it was far more sporadic and unorganized, with practically no games going. Long before that it was highschool and we had campaigns that lasted years that we would play for 12 hours at a time. Ah, youth.<br><br>The approach of having many games running at once for different combinations of players has worked very well for us in terms of quantity. We've gamed a lot more in the past few months than in the past few years, probably. The problem is, we all want to settle down with something and play it for a while, but it's really hard to do with this setup. Plus, one of the irregulars will be moving away soon and one of our core group will probably go to work abroad, too. So...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286030/#Comment_286030" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T06:49:09+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  6:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just moved to a new place and I am still working out what my gaming habits are.

The numbers have fluctuated some.  There were six of us in a dedicated Mouse Guard game that ran for several months, interspersed with some one shots that sometimes included a couple other people.  Most of the players have another regular game of some sort, so sometimes there's a bit of "I need a break from all this gaming".<br><br>Now that the MG game is over, it'll be interesting to see what happens to the group.  Some of us are interested in startijng an AW game, but some others may be drifting off due to a lack of time/interest.  My initial worries that we had too many regulars for AW have turned into worries we have too few.<br><br>We've had a couple extra sessions on the weekend where we met for dinner and a one-shot.  It's more relaxed than the weekday evening sessions.  Hopefully we'll have more in future, but for a regular game, I'm limited to weeknight play.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286046/#Comment_286046" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T08:09:06+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  8:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now my gaming habits include: reading about games, listening to gaming podcasts, and reading games.
