With a couple of exceptions, I've not played or run anything in the past ten years.  I barely remember what it was like to sit behind a GM's screen and my funny accents?  Questionable.<br/><br/>Anyway, a <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/dc-gameday-discussion/288754-so-whatcha-gonna-run-whatcha-wanna-play.html" rel="nofollow">thread was started</a> asking people what they were interested in running and what they were interested in playing and I participated.  But it got me thinking what would have been unthinkable a year ago: could I actually attempt to <i>run</i> something?  I figure it would be a simple game \u2014 I'm thinking <i>Dogs of W*A*R</i>, which is powered by the same system behind <i>Barbarians of Lemuria</i> \u2014 and not aspire to great art as a result.  Just something fun and knockabout.<br/><br/>If I did decide to do it, I'd have about a month-and-a-half to practice my moves and try to get my mojo working.  I've never actually tried to run in a self-contained four-hour block before, and I suspect it takes a certain set of skills to do correctly.  Basically I'm setting the bar kind of high for myself.  <i>If</i> I do it.  If.<br/><br/>Do you think I should go for it and accept the end result if it's a failure, or should I feel an obligation to the players I might attract?  I mean, they don't want to see somebody crash and burn at the table, they want to have a good time.  I'm looking for some encouragement here, or perhaps some kindly advice against this course of action.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C" title="Tom C"><img alt="Tom C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C">Tom C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286496/#Comment_286496" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T14:10:19+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  2:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely you should go for it. We've got lots of folks who show up to DC Gameday to run a game for the very first time, and it's always a success. Even if you "mess up" or don't quite hit it, the players are totally supportive and constructive in criticism as a rule -- DCGD is all about just showing up in your backyard (so to speak, although we get lots of folks from out of town as well) to play with folks you might not otherwise get a chance to play with, and you certainly shouldn't feel like it's any kind of high-performance/high-expectations kind of event. People generally don't care if you crash and burn at the table, and I suspect that wouldn't happen anyway, as most (if not all) the folks I know who attend would help you figure out what wasn't working and address it on the fly.<br/><br/>Because that's how we roll. <br/><br/>I think your idea for a game is perfect, using DoW/BoL -- many (if not most) of the sessions run are usually not intended to be anything but action-packed fun and entertainment... although I did end up bawling my eyes out once at <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i> game facilitated by Jim Henley.<br/><br/>So, yes, show up, and run a damn game. You might even be able to get some folks to commit to a playtest in advance if you get it done in time -- I'm assuming you live local to the DC metro area. The only way you're going to get back in the saddle is to simply get back in the saddle and ride, my friend. <br/><br/>Tom aka madwabbit @ ENworld                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286538/#Comment_286538" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T16:12:54+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  4:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never heard of Dogs of W*A*R is it an story game?<br/><br/>If your in the Northern VA area, and want to run or play story games, A butch of us meet up at The Complete Strategist, in Falls Church on Thursday at 6pm<br/><br/>Nick                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286693/#Comment_286693" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T09:15:05+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  9:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 9:15AM by Sam!.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zipht</cite>Never heard of Dogs of W*A*R is it an story game?</blockquote>\nAccording to some, <i>every</i> roleplaying game is a story game, but I'll provide <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=78447" rel="nofollow">a link to <i>Dogs of W*A*R</i></a> and you can decide for yourself.<br/><br/>As far as location goes, I am just a half-hour south of Baltimore, so I'm a little out of your area for play.

Don't be afraid to do some railroading -- it's a common expectation for most (but not all, certainly) one-off con scenarios. For action-intensive games, start 'em in media res, if you can, *or* toss the action at 'em as quickly as possible after they've established their characters via RP, to set the right mood. Conversely, for an RP-heavy game, give 'em a solid scene at the beginning to get to know their characters, know who everyone else is, and play 'em in character.<br/><br/>For beats, plan on two-three major roll'y up-beats (combat encounters, intense confrontation with the Unspeakable Beast from the Abyss, social engagements, etc., where they're all going to be busy doing lots of dice rolling or resolution), and one-two down-beats, i.e., time for them to role-play, ponder the mysteries that need to be solved, etc. Ideally, for a 4-hour game, the beats run in a five-set: UP down UP down UP -- but obviously there are variations on that. <br/><br/>Design the characters in such a way that they have "hooks" or are interlocked with one or more other characters in the group -- that kind of thing is golden for getting super-quick player buy-in, particularly if the folks playing don't really know each other all that well.<br/><br/>That should do for a start -- this is a tried (trite?) and true one-shot con game formula that usually works for the kind of game I *think* you said you were going to run. If you're facilitating "A Penny For My Thoughts" or "PrimeTime Adventures", obviously this advice is not applicable. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
