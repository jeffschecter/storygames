But, I'm too much in love with what I read to just give up. So, I got a question for those of you who has played it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way changes in NPC status only can come as a result of a conflict, does this mean the GM is forced to set up alot of scenes without PCs, only new potential victims and running conflict between monster/acolyte/slave and this new victim? Is this a problem in actual play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282885/#Comment_282885" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T06:58:13+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  6:58AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, it's been a long time since I've played Afraid, but victimization was one of the thorniest issues we encountered. It's definitely critical to the feel of things, but -- at least as I recall -- it sometimes seemed like it led to a never-ending cycle, where the PCs would free one victim just to have the monster victimize another.<br/><br/>I don't recall anything specifically about scenes without PCs, though.  That seems a bit weird.  Shouldn't those conflicts happen when the PCs are present, so they have a chance to resist the monster's efforts at further victimization?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282908/#Comment_282908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T08:47:32+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  8:47AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's Afraid?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282918/#Comment_282918" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T09:57:44+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  9:57AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2010 9:58AM by Elizabeth.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the Great Baker's foray into horror games, using Dogs In The Vineyard-like mechanics and My Life With Master-like scene framing. Imagine if, at the end of each My Life With Master scene, you went through a full Dogs conflict. It's got some cool things in it but can be problematic.<br/><br/>I think changes in NPC status happen in PC scenes, as offshoots of conflicts with PCs. I don't think there are scenes without PCs.<br/><br/>P.S.

That is, if I as the GM want the monster to get a few more dice, I need to frame a PC into a scene when a NPC status is about to change?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282977/#Comment_282977" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T15:20:39+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  3:20PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, something like that.  There's probably a way to think about it where it makes more sense, thematically, though.  Because the PCs are all supposed to be people who know the victims, right?  So it makes sense that the victimization will happen all around them.  Or maybe the monster is gradually trying to draw them in so it can victimize the PCs too.  Basically, the rule is that victimization has to happen on camera, not off camera.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, if I was gonna run Afraid nowadays, I might try to hack in some newer ideas from Apocalypse World and make Fronts for the monster's hold on various victims.  That way, you could, like, "threaten badness" against a particular victim and, if the PCs didn't do anything about it or failed in their efforts, you could advance the victimization on a AW-style countdown clock.  I know that AW and Afraid are different games with different principles, but there's probably a way to make off-screen victimization make sense, even though it may mess up the timing of other mechanics and make things even harder for the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283098/#Comment_283098" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T10:40:44+00:00" title="July 27, 2010 10:40AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I was running Afraid these days, I'd use all the monster creation rules and some of the scene-framing stuff, but a different system.
