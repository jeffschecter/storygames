That said, we're not going to run our campaign until coming late march this spring. One of the best advice I've read about KickStarter is this: "when you think you are ready, add three months". And so that is what we're going to do.<br/><br/>Our KickStarter page can be found <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/671321082/1879808645?token=d8e09677" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Some questions:<br/>- Is the goal of the project clear enough?<br/>- We have worked very hard to come with a limited, but coherent number of perks (reward level). What do you think?<br/>- As you can see, we have chosen to be multi systems, as discussed previously <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18862/kickstarter-and-rpg-is-compatible-with-fate-pathfinder-worth-the-trouble-is-it-a-must" rel="nofollow">here</a> and I think we have managed to find people who would know what they are doing with each system.<br/>- Please note the vote system we're trying to put in place. Do you think this would be engaging?<br/>- Note the very long stretch goals we have and how we have decided to regroup them, and only show the first ones in each category.<br/>- Any comments on our strategy to wait 8 to 10 weeks before launching and using our KS page as a promotional tool?<br/>- We are hesitating to put the "explicit backer" level more around 4K or 5K. We're not sure what this is worth exactly ...<br/>- We hesitate to include shipping cost in all rewards level, when applicable. Does it really change something?<br/><br/>Well, thanks again for your time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alvan" title="Alvan"><img alt="Alvan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alvan">Alvan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427538/#Comment_427538" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T06:59:34+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  6:59AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2014 7:02AM by Alvan.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The previews look gorgeous and as a developer, I'm really looking forward to seeing what you guys are doing with the website.<br/><br/>Some thoughts:<br/><br/>Just scrolling through that page takes me over 15 seconds, and that's steady mouse wheel scrolling without reading the details. There is way too much going on there for someone like me who likes to just back the project and know what they're getting. <br/><br/>The non-linear stretch goals are hard to understand and are frankly off-putting. If I was interested in getting a Shadow of Yesterday version of the product, as far as I understand, I have no way of actually knowing how close or far it is from becoming a possibility. Also reading that the project is compatible with various systems, and then discovering that the support actually depends on the stretch goals reached was very disappointing.<br/><br/>And as a person who always goes for the physical product if there is the possibility, having shipping costs listed from get-go is a huge plus. Having to allocate unknown amount of extra money to a project in addition of backing it is a hassle that I don't really like and that has (at least in the past) had a huge tendency to cause misunderstandings and mishaps.<br/><br/>All that said: If I happen to have the spare cash when the kickstarter hits, you guys have a backer here, so the preliminary promotion plan is a good one <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427544/#Comment_427544" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T07:45:10+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  7:45AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random notes:<br/><br/>Regarding the clarity and length of the page, does the Kickstarter page-building paradigm allow any sort of collapsibles? (A small Javascript script and the ability to define a div element in the html, basically.) It could fundamentally improve the approachability of the page if you could put all deep detail under some sort of links that can be opened up when the reader wants to see more detail about any given issue. Imagine if those vertical bars at the beginning of each section were collapsed when the page is first opened, and you could open each individually by clicking.<br/><br/>Failing that, putting all ancillary details about e.g. the company or the details of the complex stretch goal system on your own site and just linking to it might be worthwhile in combating the page bloat. Not that long Kickstarter pages are bad (you need to give people enough time to decide to participate while reading the page, ideally), but the presentation still needs to be manageable.<br/><br/>Also, a table of contents is a time-honored structural tool: introductory paragraph, ToC (with links to topics), and then everything else in logical linear order.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/507/280/6e3411570a3e340a68b33dd8110da743_large.png?1389199803"/>The PDF materials that you link in the "About Existanc3" section don't need to have such large cover arts as to take the entire width of the page. It makes for choppy reading when you have a sentence like "Here's an introductory download:" and then you need to scroll down to skip a huge picture to find the next sentence, only to have that followed by another big image... I know you want to put your art front and center, but an introductory video (plenty of opportunity to showcase the art in one of those) and some restraint would serve better there. The ideal way to visually depict a download like that would probably be something like I'm demonstrating here: a small visual link directly related to the text paragraph that explains what it is.<br/><br/>Technically the name of the rules system of The Shadow of Yesterday is <i>Solar System</i> (not my idea, Clinton named it in 2005 or so). It's like the name of the rules system for <i>Vampire</i> is the "Storyteller" system, two different names for slightly different, yet related, things. It's not much of a deal, and maybe the TSoY name is better known, but perhaps it would be better to use a phrasing like "the Solar System, as seen in The Shadow of Yesterday", if one wants to emphasize the TSoY connection. That way people who <i>do</i> know the game well won't get miffed about your perceived lack of knowledge about a game they like. Besides, these days there are some people out there (particularly in Europe) who know what "Solar System" is without knowing what TSoY is, as funky as that seems.<br/><br/>Regarding the ordering of the various topics, you probably shouldn't have the "News and Updates" section right up top when you start the campaign; rather, have it start at the bottom and only move it to the top when the campaign moves into a phase where returning visitors to the page are more important than newcomers. The top of the page is the first thing they'll read, so it's better if you can provide something concise and concrete about the project there until you've gotten through the first rush, at least. Even better: put a link to the news and updates at the top, and put the section itself at the bottom.<br/><br/>"About Existanc3" is a very good section to have early on in the project description, as it's the chapter where you explain what the product here is concretely. (In the lead you've established that it's a tabletop rpg campaign compatible with a bunch of rules sets; here's where you should make the detailed pitch.) However, it's named wrong, it should be "About the Project", and it should lead with as simple a description as possible: "Avalanche is a traditional high fantasy tabletop rpg campaign structured and presented in an entirely new manner..." and so on. Remember: corporate marketing speech that attempts to force immersion is not compelling in the Internet age, you don't need to drown your reader in a mass of specialty terminology you invented. You can explain about "Existanc3" later in the text, at this point it's most important for you to explain the underlying logic of what you're proposing.<br/><br/>Speaking of which: you shouldn't end the aforementioned section without having actually explained the theoretical underpinnings of the project. I could be wrong, but I suspect that the two selling points of this project are the aesthetics (which you'll need to import with choice art and flavour text detail, much of it in the video) and the unique campaign structure. The latter you need to explain with a simple description and a couple of diagrams, I suspect: tell about what problem this new setup solves, and what kind of roleplaying it accomplishes, and you should get anybody interested in experimental grand fantasy campaigning on board. A sample is good, of course, but if you don't have a theoretical bird's eye explanation, many might not care enough to examine the sample.<br/><br/>In the "Our Goal" section, swap the order of the list and the elaborating text; this way around it's more vague that the visual list at the end of the section is a listing of the project goals. Also, make that list look more like a list, now the elements sort of float in space. Maybe make the art a bit smaller and add list bullets of some sort, or make it a table with a thin border, or number the goals.<br/><br/>In the "Rewards" section, indicate clearly which rewards go with which reward levels. E.g. you might put the graphic of each entry on the left side, the text in the middle, and a balloon of some sort with the minimum dollar amount on the right. Also, put the elaboration about what the voting perk means into the table, all logical-like. (If it feels difficult to modify your images with the reward descriptions, that might be an indication that it's a bad idea to have your text be in images in the first place; cut the text out, write it on the page, and align the images as floats.)<br/><br/>Make a literal flow chart of your stretch goals; if it's a road-map of future development, make it look like it. Start it from the top of the image, put in a money gauge and a time gauge, and present visually how all these potential stretch goals inter-relate. Then, make the road-map clickable, or put in tooltip hints, so that the audience can interactively examine it and get details about the stretch goals that most interest them. Much more appealing than a long, long list.<br/><br/>Hmm, I need to leave for a dinner date, but I think those are pretty much the biggest issues that come to me. As always, being clear and straightforward about the nature of the project and its biggest selling points is the biggest chokepoint for Kickstarter campaign quality: don't let the complex stretch goal game draw all the attention, you need to make the base promise compelling to get people far enough that they'll get hooked on the rewards carneval.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427548/#Comment_427548" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T08:36:31+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  8:36AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2014 8:39AM by pells.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, thanks a lot: this is really helping me.\n<blockquote>Just scrolling through that page takes me over 15 seconds, and that's steady mouse wheel scrolling without reading the details.</blockquote>\nWell, KickStarter page are just way too long ... I know. I need to put things in the right order, but hey, I won't elude the long page. And trust me, we've worked hard to cut it down.\n<blockquote>The non-linear stretch goals are hard to understand and are frankly off-putting. If I was interested in getting a Shadow of Yesterday version of the product, as far as I understand, I have no way of actually knowing how close or far it is from becoming a possibility.</blockquote>\nOkay, about that feature, there seems to be a problem ... I'll explain and I need to find some solution for the KS page.<br/>There are two goals to this feature:<br/>- provide of fun reward at a 1$ stretch, other than the "mention in the book/twitter"<br/>- have a way to engage my audience. Some campaigns ask for the color of the t-shirt, we're thinking of asking on a regular basic where they this project to go.<br/>The behavior we are expecting from the backers:<br/>- Many backers, from my readings, wait for backing on a higher level, until certain stretches are reached. What we have in mind is a whole community, let's say 13th Age, backing us at 1$, and then all voting for a 13th Age compatibility.<br/>How this works:<br/>- For information, I'm a Agile project manager, working in IT. The idea comes from there: building up a backlog of features, of <i>almost the same size</i>. I don't know if you've worked with Agile process, but what we did here is not easy.<br/>- In fact, you will know a little bit, how far you are from the TSOY version.<br/>- We will have three states for the stretches:<br/>.   - reached: it is financed<br/>.   - unreached, but planned: it is in the upcoming stretch and <i>won't moved</i>. This states could have three, four or five <i>ordered</i> stretch goals<br/>.   - unreached, unplanned: well, you don't know how close you are of them<br/>What might needs to be done:<br/>Maybe I should represent that in some kind of graphics and already choose a stretch goal myself as unreached, but planned (maybe a compatibility system?). And below it, explain how this works.\n<blockquote>Also reading that the project is compatible with various systems, and then discovering that the support actually depends on the stretch goals reached was very disappointing.</blockquote>\nOkay, okay ... you're not the first one to tell me. I've added the information just below the image. Note that many others successful KS campaign didn't mention it. I think it is fair, and it allows me to state that it is compatible with other systems.\n<blockquote>Having to allocate unknown amount of extra money to a project in addition of backing it is a hassle</blockquote>\nWell, finally, we'll go with the "add 25$ for shipping worldwide". Is that alright as it is?<br/><br/>I'll need separate posts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427559/#Comment_427559" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T10:15:41+00:00" title="January 22, 2014 10:15AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Regarding the clarity and length of the page, does the Kickstarter page-building paradigm allow any sort of collapsibles?</blockquote>\nEero, the text editor of a KS campaign is shit. Really. No Javascript, no HTML code, no anchor. I just love your ideas and understand what you want, but nope, I can't be done. I can do italic, bold, link and image/video. Not even h1, h2, h3. Can't put an image beside a text. Forget about tooltip, table of content. <br/>That's why, I think, KS pages are way too long.\n<blockquote>Not that long Kickstarter pages are bad (you need to give people enough time to decide to participate while reading the page, ideally), but the presentation still needs to be manageable.</blockquote>\nI know. I need to order things a little.\n<blockquote>The PDF materials that you link in the "About Existanc3" section don't need to have such large cover arts as to take the entire width of the page.</blockquote>\nI'm thinking of doing two things about this:<br/>- have "about the project" how on the page, with links to the three teasers in text (no image).<br/>- put below (way down below the stretch) a section about Avalanche and use smaller images, adjacent to text (well, obviously, it would be all an image) that explains what you're about to download. That way, I think I get the best of both worlds.\n<blockquote>Technically the name of the rules system of The Shadow of Yesterday is Solar System </blockquote>\nI've found the logo. I'm going to change it. Just give me a couple of days.\n<blockquote>Regarding the ordering of the various topics, you probably shouldn't have the "News and Updates" section right up top when you start the campaign; rather, have it start at the bottom and only move it to the top when the campaign moves into a phase where returning visitors to the page are more important than newcomers.

That said, I think it is better to have it at the top of the page. You'll tell me what you think.<br/>Honestly, here's the first things I want you to know:<br/>- we're not live until late march. Go hit that button "notice me when this campaign launches" and "go to my Facebook page to like me".<br/>- things are not perfect, we have identified it, and we're working on it.<br/>I do think, and I may be wrong, that using a KS page for 8 to 10 weeks as a direct promotional tool is not that common. I'm going to drive trafic there (and Facebook) and also I'm going to do some buzz with the video (we're doing separate launch on purpose). So, I want people to feel it alive as soon as possible. I would use the update option if I could. Does it make sense? I'll keep the section very short by cleaning it.\n<blockquote>However, it's named wrong, it should be "About the Project", and it should lead with as simple a description as possible: "Avalanche is a traditional high fantasy tabletop rpg campaign structured and presented in an entirely new manner..." and so on.</blockquote>\nYes, I'll follow your advice and move stuff around.\n<blockquote>You can explain about "Existanc3" later in the text, at this point it's most important for you to explain the underlying logic of what you're proposing.</blockquote>\nI know ... but you might remember I always had a hard time explaining it ...\n<blockquote> I could be wrong, but I suspect that the two selling points of this project are the aesthetics (which you'll need to import with choice art and flavour text detail, much of it in the video) and the unique campaign structure.</blockquote>\nYou are right.

Our second teaser, this <a href="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/ExiStanc3-The_game_master_way.pdf" rel="nofollow">one</a>, explains this in 8 pages, with diagram. We also explain, with a strong bias what rpg is for us. You didn't download it, didn't you? That's why I think I need to put the link into a text.<br/>Also, lately, I've been thinking about a way to present it, but I'm not sure this works well:<br/>"Where most websites that offers tools to help you manage campaigns for rpg use some kind of Wiki or blog, we, at ExiStanc3, think those linear tools are not sufficient to help you with the truly epic, challenging stories you want to build. What we are proposing is some kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart" rel="nofollow">GANTT</a>, specifically adapted for role playing games, that will help you organise all the important events happening in a <i>living</i> world, where stakes are high and time does matter. The website we are developing is a somehow lighter version of MS Project, that will allow you to know what is happening where in the world in a couple of clics and add your own content. We'll help you play the game at the scale you have always dreamed of. Avalanche is a one of kind product, the first to use this specific design."<br/>Not sure how evident it is to speak about GANTT. How does this sound?\n<blockquote>In the "Our Goal" section, swap the order of the list and the elaborating text; this way around it's more vague that the visual list at the end of the section is a listing of the project goals.</blockquote>\nYou want everything up in the image? I won't have much space. Well, I guess a good "about the project" should make this section lightier.\n<blockquote>In the "Rewards" section, indicate clearly which rewards go with which reward levels.</blockquote>\nWell, rewards and perks (reward level) are separated on purpose. We have tried something to describe the perks (what type of customers you are). It seems it doesn't work (you're third telling me it this week). I'll just put the description, the same as on the right column to describe the reward. It's dull, but hey.\n<blockquote>Make a literal flow chart of your stretch goals; if it's a road-map of future development, make it look like it. Start it from the top of the image, put in a money gauge and a time gauge, and present visually how all these potential stretch goals inter-relate. </blockquote>\nFirst, I have to tell you that we did cut a lots of stretch goals. We do have around 150 stretch goals budgeted. It is the roadmap for the next three years. That said, we already "regroup" them together. They do not really inter relate more than we do already. In fact, I can continue to write Avalanche and have feature of the website developped at the same time. I think I can begin by removing some. I would remove: "management of systems", "multi DM play", "do it yourself", "our system: Shadow and Light". I'll always be able to show them later and it would simplify the page. Maybe, I'm just putting too much of those.<br/>But, they are also there to show that this project is ambitious, and has a vision of long term development. What do you think?<br/><br/>I'll begin to make some changes.

That might help both present the full scope of the vision as well as keep the currently relevant possibilities somehow manageable. Right now that list of potential stretch goals blurs together easily for the reader, as it's so long and arranged by topic instead of importance.<br/><br/>Also, you might consider putting those visual stretch goal introduction lists into a single pdf that you link from the page, similar to how you're liking the preview materials. This would also help manage the information flow, and I suspect that this type of visual list would look better in a separate pdf. Note that nowadays web browsers are starting to be pretty handy with pdfs, for most users clicking on a link like that can be just as easy and fast as opening a html page. If you had the full explanations in a separate file, you could then have a compact list/table of the possibilities, their popularity, whatever else metadata on the page itself.<br/><br/>Regarding having a detailed explanation of the structural approach - yes, I totally didn't look at those pdfs yet. I suspect that this might be how your audience will approach the matter as well, they won't read the pdfs before they've decided that they're interested, and that might be too late if they never get to be interested. I mean, one would assume that I'm at least moderately interested in this funding drive, and I still failed to immediately investigate the offered pdfs, so what does that tell about how others are likely to act <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Now that I've looked at the pdfs, yes, they provide the exact sort of detailed information that people will want. Perhaps you could lift some little bit of this detail for the actual page as well? Something like 3-5 paragraphs of text and a single diagram of some sort, just to give a taste of the <i>type and quality of thinking</i> that this project represents. I suspect that it might attract some people to look at the pdfs for more detailed information; the sort who will cynically ignore a video and just skim through the text of the page to see if there's any concrete ideas, any beef to the project, or if it's all just pretty promises and explanations about backer rewards.<br/><br/>Regarding the dragon hunters pdf, don't you think that you should provide some simple, detailed instructions for how to turn the timeline and backstory into an adventure in real play context? I know that the idea of the product will be to have space for different games to process the material differently (I know that e.g. Solar System has completely different adventure structure from Pathfinder, say), but you could say this and still show for the sake of demonstration a step-by-step example of how some game - perhaps your own favourite one - would utilize this material in practice. I fear that without such pointed advice a reader might come out confused and dejected, thinking that the idea of the project is interesting, but too difficult to use in practice.<br/><br/>(Also, it might be preferable to start the scenario with the setting and NPC data, and have the time-line at the end. At least to me it seems easier to grasp what the material is attempting to do if it's presented in that order, as setting and NPC specs are familiar types of material from other rpg products already.)<br/><br/>I quite like the pdfs, for what it's worth; I think that once you get somebody to be curious enough to look at them, it's likely that you'll have a sale if they're both a) not averse to traditional high fantasy, and b) generally Kickstarter-optimistic. Those are not that uncommon traits, so as long as you can get people to look at the pdfs (or maybe make your video so informative that it'll transmit the same vision), this might well have some fortune in the crowdfunding marketplace.<br/><br/>A minor technical point: the Firefox integrated pdf reader doesn't display some things in the pdfs correctly. The most important bits are the lower sidebar boxes in the sample adventure, the text in them is not displaying. I use a somewhat old version of Firefox (various add-on compatibility issues make me a bit slow to update), so it's possible that this isn't an issue for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427595/#Comment_427595" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-23T11:54:41+00:00" title="January 23, 2014 11:54AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Right now that list of potential stretch goals blurs together easily for the reader, as it's so long and arranged by topic instead of importance.</blockquote>\nI have taken out 60% of the blocs. I believe, at the moment, what we need is to focus on the first initial goal. The four last blocs we left behind are really highlights. The thing is, if this KS goes well, I can always put them back easily. A long list of financed stretch is a better thing than a long list of unfinanced ones.\n<blockquote>Also, you might consider putting those visual stretch goal introduction lists into a single pdf that you link from the page</blockquote>\nNope. I'm quite happy as it is. This just looks too complicated. I do have a complex project, so let's focus and keeping it simple.\n<blockquote>Regarding having a detailed explanation of the structural approach - yes, I totally didn't look at those pdfs yet. I suspect that this might be how your audience will approach the matter as well, they won't read the pdfs before they've decided that they're interested, and that might be too late if they never get to be interested. I mean, one would assume that I'm at least moderately interested in this funding drive, and I still failed to immediately investigate the offered pdfs, so what does that tell about how others are likely to act <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nI think I like the solution I've come up with. I've followed your advices. Look at the text 'about this project': the teasers are included in the text. And below my stretch goals, I have place the three teasers with small images. I think this is going to work best that way.<br/>What do you think of the text in 'about this project'? Is that what you had in mind? It's mostly extract from the teasers (as you recommanded).\n<blockquote>Regarding the dragon hunters pdf, don't you think that you should provide some simple, detailed instructions for how to turn the timeline and backstory into an adventure in real play context?</blockquote>\nThe dragons hunters is not my favorite teaser. You might have noticed that it is not present in the 'about the project'. It seems (not my call here, but the one of the team) that this is playable that way. The idea with this teaser (by the way, if you have not noticed, it's my old one that was pimped) was to introduce new comers to the world of Avalanche, without the specific structure. So, it's supposed to look like a typical adventure module. It is meant to be played in a linear way.\n<blockquote>I quite like the pdfs, for what it's worth; I think that once you get somebody to be curious enough to look at them, it's likely that you'll have a sale if they're both a) not averse to traditional high fantasy, and b) generally Kickstarter-optimistic.

"Setting reminiscent of the Renaissance more than the middle ages" and "world where the likes of Sauron and Ganondorf are victorious" are very good soundbites, and I think they'll appeal to your customer demographic. The rest of the description is satisfyingly clear as well; I think if that doesn't sell it, then it wasn't the customer for this project to begin with.<br/><br/>The rest of it is looking increasingly polished as well (needs proofreading, of course, but what doesn't). The amount of detail is much better, and moving the downloads to the bottom parts makes it much easier to get to the informative bits while scrolling. The only part I'm iffy on is the stretch goals, perhaps because they're expressed in such cumbersome format, but they do admittedly paint an ambitious picture, so maybe it works.<br/><br/>A few more stray thoughts (I promise, I don't have many more of these):<br/><br/>I would rather see the "Rewards" graphics lined up the same way the graphics are in the "Our Goal" section; having them zig-zag from side to side seems unnecessarily disorderly. By using the same left-aligned visual arrangement in both you'll increase visual consistently through the page.<br/><br/>One thing you might add to either the video or the preview pdfs: screen mock-ups of software and websites are a compelling tool that shows people very concretely what you mean when you say that you're creating a computer tool of some sort. It might be a good idea to have a few mock-ups here of how you envision the website version of Avalanche to look like.<br/><br/>I notice that your team boasts some real website management experience. Perhaps that's something you should emphasize a little bit more. For example, you could boast in the "The Team" section a little bit about how this isn't the first website that these people have ever developed. Some Kickstarter backers care about prior merits, after all.<br/><br/>Regarding the terminology you use about system compatibility - this was already said, but you should perhaps not rely on standard expressions like "compatible with" in explaining the relationship of the product to various rules systems. In actual fact the product is a systemless fantasy rpg campaign, which is an understandable and established product niche; it <i>might</i> gain compatibility with one or more rules systems via stretch goals, but it's too soon to say that it is compatible now, except in the way it's compatible with anything anywhere. Perhaps a way to express the relationship with your chosen rules-sets less likely to annoy pedantic customers would be to say that the campaign is "well suited to" these systems, or "developed with an eye towards compatibility with" (too long, I know).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427692/#Comment_427692" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-27T09:01:56+00:00" title="January 27, 2014  9:01AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I would rather see the "Rewards" graphics lined up the same way the graphics are in the "Our Goal" section; </blockquote>\nGrrr ...

I've settled for 'Play with your favorite system'. The funny is, the compatibility is not Avalanche, but the system.
