All stats point towards that, but I've been considering adding a certain feature that would force the players acting against their character's best interest in order to make them somewhat develop their personality and avoid bidimensional characters. This would be a narrativist feature, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe feature is, more specifically, called a "theme". While characters have by a definite style given by advantages that help defining them, in adding this theme, they should write down a question whose answer is going to them to get against what they usually would do. Like in a ruthless, cruel character, a good theme would be "can I show mercy?" or a coldminded, cautious one, could have "can my feelings overcome my logic?".<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, at the end of a given period of play, the answer is "yes", the character is awarded victory points (which advantages him because this is a player vs player game.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think this feature could be superfluous or worse turn the game into an incoherent one? <br/>\nIf my explanation wasn't clear enough, please let me know and I'll try to rephrase. You have to forgive my terrible English :)<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nTazio                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234504/#Comment_234504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-28T04:21:31+00:00" title="September 28, 2009  4:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you're doing is encouraging people to ALWAYS play all their scenes so that the answer to the question is yes (since that's rewarded). Also, there will probably be a lot of arguing about the answer. Who should answer it? If you want harcore Step On Up play, you can't let the player decide (since she'd be incentivized to always answer yes, since she's trying to "win"). If you let the GM decide, there's a "play to impress the GM" dynamic that you might or might not want.<br/><br/>Those are my quick thoughts. The main problem is that there is no incentive not to behave so that the answer to the question is always yes. So that certainly won't make the characters less flat. In a worst case scenario, you're punishing people for playing their characters well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234510/#Comment_234510" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-28T05:47:56+00:00" title="September 28, 2009  5:47AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Simon, and thank you very much for your valuable comment.

Which will you choose? Which is more important? This builds Theme.<br/><br/>The core of gamism is to choose between two different means. Which is more effective? Which will bring you closer to your goal with as little cost as possible? This builds Challenge.<br/><br/>The way to have one of the modes support the other (which is what you should aim for in order to avoid incoherence, according to the Big Model) is to first let the characters choose between goals and then, once that is set, give them different means to use to pursue those goals. Depending on where the focus lands, you'll get a narrativist game supported by gamist Techniques or a gamist game supported by narrativist Techniques. Or an inbetweeny game that will easily Drift to one mode or the other (Abashed, I think is the term). Or an incoherent mess, I guess.<br/><br/>Sorry for the jargonspeak, but you started it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234515/#Comment_234515" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-28T06:47:13+00:00" title="September 28, 2009  6:47AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, jargon is perfectly ok, so no worries :)<br/>\nAnd you explanation was, again, very helpful.<br/>\nEach goal should, according to your description, also imply different game mechanics or could it be a mere "what I want to earn" thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be more specific about the game.

The most important thing is that you don't have a choice where one option means not engaging with the challenge. Like, your lover says to you to spare her mother, who's the woman you've been trying to kill. Choosing to spare her will mean you don't get to engage the combat system, but rather just end the mission for you right there. In gamist play, that'd be a buzzkill.<br/><br/>In fact, having the exact same mechanics independent of goal chosen might be an advantage, as you don't have to worry about the "I want to do this, so I choose that" risks. Ideally, the choice between goals should only affect the Color. Since Color is pretty unimportant in gamist play, that's very safe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234565/#Comment_234565" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-28T13:40:28+00:00" title="September 28, 2009  1:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Point well taken.

Like in Montsegur 1244. At the end of each mission, there's an important choice to be made, like "Do you rescue the scientist or kill him?" or something like that. The one who gets there first gets to decide what to do with it. This way, you can lay out facts pointing in different directions, like meeting the scientist's daughter who wants daddy back, or seeing the results of the scientist's terrible experiments on humans. All of these revelations have no impact on the game when they're done (you still have to get the Conquest), but they all inform the choice that the winner is going to have to make in the end. You can get some cool dramatic irony effects out of this, as the player knows something her character doesn't, due to some other character finding it out. Like, the character thinks the scientist is a monster, but another character found out it was all a misunderstanding. Pretty cool, and shouldn't get in the way of the gamist core.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234624/#Comment_234624" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T00:08:53+00:00" title="September 29, 2009 12:08AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true.

Steal it? Destroy it? Sabotage it and kidnap the scientist?). You have to choose the Goal at character creation, but nobody forces you achieving it in a literal way: you may find yourself wanting to break your contract with the Employer, and if the game goes on after one Conquest, the Employer might as well become a nemesis (and there are specific rules for Nemesis that make them rather fearsome).
