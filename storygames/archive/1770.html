                    One of my backburnered projects has been rising to the top of my brain lately, and it occured to me that maybe it wouldn't be entirely out of line for me to talk about it here.  Maybe ask for helping hand.<br/><br/>The project is an rpg called Brimstone.  The setting is bland medievel european fantasyland sans all supernatural elements.  Sole exception and point of interest: there are demons.  The PCs are highly motivated, self-destructive people who, one way or another, have ended up with a certain amount of demon-derived power.  Their fuckedupness is derived from the corrupting nature of their power and/or the mindset required to find/achieve that power in the first place.  Demons are alien, inimical to our reality and from somewhere else.  They are also usually on fire.  They do not understand you but they hate you and they need you.  Under the increasing influence of demons, the world has been ending slowly for a while now and is approaching tipping point.<br/><br/>Baseline mechanic (assume a standard rpg task resolution system): Rolls are Xd6+Y.  The X is your stat and any advantages you might have.  it probably hovers around 2-5 depending.  The Y is an unnatural modifier which varies wildly.  <br/><br/>Note the way that natural and unnatural things contribute differently to the roll.  This is thematicly important.  Demons, for example, behave oddly in the system because their rolls are mostly unnatural modifiers.  This is good because it means less dice rolling for the GM to bother with, and because it makes them stand out within the system as being weird and wrong, just like they are in the game world.<br/><br/>There are character classes, which define the nature of your kewl powerz.  Because I love character classes and because I love kewl powerz.  And I want the distinctions between those character classes and their abilities to be <i>important</i>.  As much as possible I want to create an appropriate feel at the player level for what their character is like in game.  And I'm doing that with dice tricks.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/><b>Gunslingers </b>â€“ otherwise normal humans who have taken up hellfire-spitting guns to level the playing field  â€“ get to add a bonus to the result of a violence roll.  Much like damage is normally handled in degree of success games, except it's only gunsligners get to do it here (because pyreguns are <i>important</i> and they go BANG).  They can also grit their teeth and <i>try harder</i> to get re-rolls in certain circumstances.  Partly to reflect their general strength of will, and also because it helps counterbalance the whiff factor that all-or-nothing mechanics like the bang usually create.<br/><br/><b>Swordbearers </b>â€“ your average dude bound to a demon weapon that's fated to eat his soul.  They get to add their taint (cariable tracking degree of demonic corruption) to their violence rolls as an unnatural mod.<br/><br/><b>Firebloods </b>â€“ someone with demon-derived immortality â€“ get to be reckless and use health as a renewable resource and can â€œbuyâ€ situational bonuses at a cost of personal injury.<br/><br/><b>Exorcists </b>get to add <i>their opponent's</i> taint level to their own rolls.  They can also seccumb to temptation and get an instant bonus at the cost of increasing their own taint level.<br/><br/>Those guys (and a few others)  are sorted.  They're all at the stage where I can say â€œI know what I want the gubbins of the system to cope with and I'll sort out the specifics laterâ€.<br/><br/>Grafters are the problem.<br/><br/><b>Grafters</b> are people who have decided, for one reason or another, that the rational thing to do is to carve away their bodies and replace certain vital organs and/or appendages with replacements harvested from dead demons to make themselves, faster, stronger, better.  No, they are not well-balanced people.<br/><br/>The root of the problem is that the Grafter's forte is supposed to be violence, much like the swordbearer and the gunslinger.  But by the design constraints I've set out they've got to feel appropriately different.  Extra complication - I want to use the idea that grafts can be transitory and changed in play.  Emphasise the fact that these are guys are freaky body-modders.  Fiddly specific rules (the usual easy way to make customization interesting) are not what I'm after though.<br/><br/>I've been wordy enough so far, so I'll cut the blather and get to the point:  Anybody got any useful ideas to make them feel good and different mechanicly, along the lines of the examples I've already given?<br/><br/>Also, aside from that specific problem, any general feedback on the ideas I've talked is always nifty.  What is/isn't cool?  What sounds appealing and what sounds boring and dumb, etc.                </div>

                            If they're using parts of dead demons...do those parts last forever? Or do they slowly wear out and need to be changed? That then requires them to do some swapping, and mechanically you could track the wear-down.<br/><br/>Another option is to have the possibility of the demon-parts rebelling in some way. Maybe harming the grafter or try to twist his actions into something he didn't intend.<br/><br/>Combining the two, you could have parts that "go rebel" at some point. Maybe the grafter needs that extra boost of power at some point, so he let's go some of his control, and lets a demon part use its full power. But at that same moment, the demon part gets back some of its intellect/consciousness, and it's a one-way street. Forever after, it'll try to twist what he does. The only option is to live with it or replace it with a new part.<br/><br/>I think imparting the idea that these are living demon pieces, with their own crazy identity, is important.                        </div>

OK, so to state the obvious: we need an inventory of demon parts and each one could have an "unnatural" modifier. It sounds like the the "unnatural" modifier for a part could be derived from the taint level of the original demon: a bit like the rule for Exorcists.<br/><br/>I like Jasper's ideas of the parts going <i>wrong</i> in some way. I think that, if you roll a 1 in your 3d6, your part goes out of action, and you have to use another one next time (this will happen very often). Perhaps, if you roll two 1s, the part actively works against what you're trying to do.<br/><br/>Yeah, it does sound cool, and I like the different classes. I'm slightly worried about the 3d6 + unnatural modifier: how's that varying modifier going to play out in the game? It'd be irritating if I kept getting huge plus and minuses to my roll which I couldn't control.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Two ideas:<br/><br/>1. The demon parts morph. Sometimes under the control of the wearer - but mostly not (maybe you could tie this to the die roll being above or below the unnatural modifier).<br/><br/>2. The demon parts gradually turn the Grafter into the original demon, changing from symbiote to parasite to devourer.                        </div>

                            Consider the option of creating an interesting die mechanic and then replacing the Grafters with a character class that matches your new mechanic - if only as an exercise that might yield some fruit, before coming back to your Grafters.  Not to discourage, but you've created a difficult design problem for yourself in that you want a sort of modular, customizable class, but don't want "fiddly specific rules" associated with it.<br/>
<br/>
If you simply want to play up an additional "power at a cost/risk" angle, perhaps Grafters make some kind of "saving throw" when they change mods and/or use whatever modular power they've gained, and failing that save increases their Taint (or harms some other resource). <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like an interesting setting.  I hope some flavorful puritanical organization that does not traffic in demons, but whose methods and morals are equally suspect is in the making.                        </div>

                            Thankyou.  And yes actually.  I'm glad the need for such a thing is obvious to someone other than me.  I've actually got them as one of the two "poles" of the setting, the other being a "city of sin" where demonology is indulged in openly and everyone is steppiing on their fellow man's fingers.  The idea being that both are opposite extreme reactions and just as bad as each other.<br/><br/>Anwyay.<br/><br/>Grafts rebelling and doing their own thing is definitely an appropriate thing.  I'm disinclined to define a class by its weakness though.  My current plan is to actually make that a positive ability - one of the options you can pick to make your character unique beyond the character class.  A vestigial demonic consciousness in your grafts that acts to protect you without you having to actively think about it.  The negative side would be invoked in exchange for some kind of currency.  Ideally I'd like all the demon-derived customisation options (for every class) to be double-edged swords like that.<br/><br/>I was thinking that it might be a good idea to distinguish between recent and old grafts.  There's all the work that the grafter has done to themselves in the past that's been properly integrated into their system - that would probably be abstracted as a continuous unnatural bonus.  But the arm you just took from that demon last scene would be handled differently mechanicly.  It would give you a specific extra bonus when using it.<br/>You can assume that any grafter is constantly making minor improvements and tending fresh grafts.  At some point you incorporate that arm fully into your system and you lose the specific bonus in exchange for an increase increase in the generic grafter bonus.  Which also releases enough strain on your system that you could make another major modification. (this would probably tie into the advancement mechanic, which for all characters boils down to increasing their taint level.)<br/><br/>That way I can limit the fiddly specifics to just one graft at a time and creates an imrpession of gradually upgrading themsekves, rather than gradually beoming a mess of weird features.  But at the same time there's variation in what exactly the grafter can do.  What if the player keeps a list of all the specific grafts that have been incorporated into his system, and they can still be invoked (maybe once per scene?) for an appropriate one-off bonus.  That might be a way to prevent old grafts from being forgotten, and to give the grafter a kind of toolbox feeling.<br/><br/>I like the idea of having the current graft-in-progress being semi-disposable.  Maybe they can sacrifice it to ignore an injury (the new arm gets chopped off), or for a larger one-off bonus by overstressing it.  I'm not sure if that'd be too much mechanical detail compared to the payoff though.  But it <i>would</i> encourage more chop-and-changing.<br/><br/>Still - the end result would still be a flat unnatural modifier, just like the swordbearer.  I'm thinking it might be worthwhile to focus on the tooolbox of old grafts and make invoking them the mechanicly interesting bit.  That way the grafter <i>does</i> just function like a less-potent sowrdbearer most of the time, but has a set of trump cards they can play in certain circumstances to shine (without the need to continually track a bunch of different abilities).  <br/><br/>A flat unnatural bonus for invoking seems like the easiest solution, but also the least interesting.  Maybe they can set a dice to a 6 without rolling it - that effectively turns that (natural) dice into a +6 unnatural modifier, which matches up nicely with the grafter's theme of turning themselves from human to demon.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>
