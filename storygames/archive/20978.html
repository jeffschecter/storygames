Ostensibly it was aimed at Indie RPG designer and publishers playtesting the games of tomorrow for people. In practice it seems to be the usual mix. (There was some Cthulhu, for instance.) <br/><br/>Given that IndieCon is gone or appears to be (the corpse is twitching), and it never really filled it's remit anyway, do people think there would be any interest in a convention devoted specifically to new games? Or is there already something like this in the US?<br/> <br/>I don't think it would work for one main reason. Everyone wants to playtest, run and play in their own games. No-one wants to playtest, run or play in other people's rules. Or see them playtested or run at an event which could be playtesting and running THEIR great creations. <br/><br/>Or are the authors and players of story games generally more open an welcoming?<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460411/#Comment_460411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-18T09:38:29+00:00" title="February 18, 2017  9:38AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I've been idly mulling this over since forever, so here's some random thoughts.<br/>It's sort of an exchange, isn't it? I mean, it's generally not-so-easy to find people you can playtest <i>with</i> who aren't your regular crew you've been gaming with every other week since forever (and you can read each others' mind and stuff, so not necessarily the best possible playtest). With the right kind of organization, it makes sense to have a convention where I get my own game playtested with and by strangers, and contribute some time of mine toward playtesting a stranger's game or three. It's a mutually profitable exchange.<br/><br/>However, there are a lot of qualitatively different steps in the design/playtest loop... When I bring a game of mine to a con and label it a playtest (and I do) it's always something I've been trying at home at least once or twice with my close friends, and now I'm looking for proof it can be enjoyed by strangers too... Like, I'm not <i>warranting</i> you'll have a good time playing - nobody ever can - but I am trying in earnest to give you a good time and make it worth your while. It's a <i>play</i> situation, not just a do-me-a-favor situation. Conversely, I've been in "playtest" sessions at conventions which felt like a chore, not play, because frankly the game being tested <i>wasn't ready for testing yet</i>. I'm not holding this against the designers, who did believe labeling their sessions as playtests completely excused them from not having a playable prototype yet: we just had very different expectations about public playtesting.<br/>Organizing a playtest convention should IMHO entail either taking a stance on the above point, or developing some sort of basic language about different stages of completion in a game design, to prevent excessively mismatched expectations from souring it all up.<br/><br/>Speaking of mismatched expectations... Usually, when I bring a game of mine to a con I expect it to be played in earnest and for fun. By labeling it a "playtest" I mean it hasn't been played a lot yet, thus I'm still collecting data from play to decide on eventual (possibly major) design changes. But I genuinely want people to try and have fun, and if they can't, it's a failed playtest to me. I've seen people, though, who knowing it's a playtest interpret it as a "stress test" situation: they actively start looking for ways to break the game. I suppose this has its uses too, but to me it feels more like work than play, and if it were what I was looking for I'd be explicitly asking for it.<br/>As a different but related case, I've seen people who, in a role-playing game "playtest", are much more lightly engaged with the fictional content of the game than they usually would, while trying to engage with its explicit mechanics more - as game mechanics needed be tested and the fictional content wasn't as important to it. I don't believe this is possible for a "story" game, where fiction and mechanics feed into each other and fictional content isn't just a boardgame's packaging. Like Ben Robbins has said, at my playtest sessions I want people to "just play" --- confident that the accumulated data from a lot of sessions will show any important design weaknesses I have to deal with.<br/>Again, in organizing a playtest-oriented convention you'd have to address these sorts of mismatches in expectations <i>somehow</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460412/#Comment_460412" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-18T09:49:33+00:00" title="February 18, 2017  9:49AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I conducted a playtest gaming group - a group that convened weekly to playtest various games - in Helsinki for a couple of years, and it worked well enough. I think a convention would be a bit more difficult, and it wouldn't necessarily bring any particular advantages with it. A regular group has the advantages of flexibility and in-depth studio critique, as you can run quick one-shot verifications, long virgin flight campaigns and everything in between, plus it's much more realistic to get people to commit to homework (writing up play reports or whatever) with a regular group than with a convention.<br/><br/>So I guess that while organized playtesting is a good idea, I wouldn't recommend a convention dedicated to it. Or, if it has to be a convention, could it be a monthly affair? I feel that the playtest process as a whole benefits greatly from continuity, and a single one-off convention just doesn't do much more than whets the appetite for it. To me it feels like a convention gives you the most trivial part of playtesting (quick one-offs with strangers) while militating against the actually useful parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460413/#Comment_460413" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-18T10:01:26+00:00" title="February 18, 2017 10:01AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as cons like that in the US, while I've never been to it I'm under the impression that Metatopia fills that role of a convention dedicated to new material, playtesting, and designer interaction. It's not story game-dedicated in any way, but it has substantial interaction from story game designers (with names like Vincent Baker, Jason Morningstar, Avery Alder, Ron Edwards, and Marissa Kelly on the list last year, to name a couple).<br/><br/>I don't find much truth in designers not wanting to play in other people's playtests just because we have our own stuff we could run, but it's possible that experience is merely regional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460414/#Comment_460414" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-18T10:48:05+00:00" title="February 18, 2017 10:48AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments.

My first couple of years at GenCon, I barely left that room. There were at least eight games in every two-hour play slot for the whole four-day convention (some repeated several times, but still, a lot of variety and a lot of games) and the room was generally full. People generally get to meet the designers, try the games, and provide feedback. I've been at tables where the designers experimented with rules on the fly to see how players responded, or solicited optional rules from players. <br/><br/>Last year I went to a con called Archon that has a robust gaming track, where people just sign up for RPG slots. Two of the games I played last year were being betaed by designers who wanted to run their games past new players and get feedback before launching Kickstarters.<br/><br/>I have in the past been part of a group, arranged by a local RPG podcast, that met monthly to play whatever indie games people brought. The podcasters would sometimes bring their own games to beta with an indie-friendly group.<br/><br/>So while IndieBetaCon might be hard to get off the ground, there are lots of ways to take advantage of existing scenes and existing audiences and conventions. And if your indie track at an existing con is well-organized and fun, it'll be well-attended, which might make it easier to spin it off into its own con or meetup group once you have a following of your own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460419/#Comment_460419" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-18T18:19:39+00:00" title="February 18, 2017  6:19PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2017 4:18PM by James_Stuart.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Metatopia is the highlight of a lot of people's con's schedule in the indie/freeform community. There's a lot of techniques they use which help:<br/>* designers pay a larger fee, people who playtest only get in for nearly free<br/>* they strongly discourage 4-hour playtests, and have a non lockstep schedule, which means there's always lots of socialization opportunities.<br/>* they do a good job of encouraging games at all stages of doneness, and then signal how done a game is to potential players (&lt;- <a href="/forums/profile/rafu%29">@rafu)</a> <br/>* designers are strongly expected to be playtesting other people's games<br/>* there is no finished games track: every game there is to be playtested<br/><br/>But really, at the heart of why the con works is that Vinny and Avie put an enormous amount of time into making sure that every playtest goes off, it's got the type of players they want, and the designers come in feeling supported. I think that love and care for the experience is really crucial to getting people to try out things they're unsure about.<br/><br/>You will also have to deal with, as organizer, a lot of tensions. People have very different notions of what giving feedback means, and new game designers are often in the worst place to know how to control those conversations.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460443/#Comment_460443" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T12:23:22+00:00" title="February 20, 2017 12:23PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Everyone wants to playtest, run and play in their own games.
