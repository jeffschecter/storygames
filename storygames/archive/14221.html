And this detail adds to the game.<br/><br/>Partly, it creates interesting situations. The second example, above, does this. <br/><br/>And partly it adds colour. <br/><br/>What it <i>shouldn't</i> do is act as a needless block. So here is a GM overstepping the role of the Guardian of Realism:<br/><br/><i>Player: So I force the lock open.<br/>GM: Right.

So not allowing the librarian to break in, is because that's the thief's job. Realism extends not just to game world but also what the characters do.<br/><br/>To a certain extent this includes player expectation. Characters have abilities which they should use in appropriate situations. If there is an outdoorsman skill then hiking through the night implies that this ability should be used. Some players like to triumph through adversity, so just resolving the hiking situation is enough for them. Some players like story so the hiking situation needs to have narrative impact to be interesting, it should be about more than just a use of the outdoorsman ability. Which kind of realism are you after?<br/><br/>And there we go, I've just bought GNS into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322738/#Comment_322738" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T03:57:15+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  3:57AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a role that's very much in use when I'm GMing to children. <br/><br/>"Let's break down the wall!"<br/>"That's an excellent idea! The wall is thick and made of stone. What kind of tools should you use? Light or heavy? Wide or narrow? Blunt or sharp? What skills or spells do you have that might come in handy?"<br/><br/>"I'm going to jump on his head and bite his ears off!"<br/>"I'm having a little trouble imagining that. Could you mime it for me?"<br/><br/>Basically what I do as GoR is to make sure everyone is on the same page, and everyone can imagine the kind of action that's going on. I also encourage the players to think on their character's resources as "real" resources such as tools rather than game resources such as chips and hit points.<br/><br/>Because adults have a more established perception of reality and basic physics, and are much less likely to suggest breaking down the wall with an empty tin can, the GoR rears his head much less often in adult groups. However, when I supervise children GMing to their peers, the GoR is much more lax; if your ship sinks, of course you can swim all the way to the next island. If your army goes hungry, they can just eat grass and worms or whatever. Sometimes, as a non-GM guide, I wear the GoR hat.<br/>"So, guys, how long can you swim in real life? How much better are your characters at swimming. GM, how far away to the next island? What are the chances they'll make it there before passing out from exhaustion?"<br/><br/>On an unrelated note, I once played in a sci-fi campaign where one of the players was a physicist. Even though he wasn't the GM, he often wore the GoR hat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322760/#Comment_322760" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T07:12:20+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  7:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>What it<i>shouldn't</i>do is act as a needless block.

Physical realism may be a priority, yes, but what's more interesting is, say, setting stakes, or making it clear what they're attempting, etc.<br><br>Steve, yay GNS! I would add that a) a good design and b) a group that knows what it wants will, together, use procedures/mechanics that prioritize "activating" abilities for reasons appropriate to the group's agenda (take "agenda" as broadly as you like). <br/>So, in the case of the hiking-by-night, it could totes be just about the physical realism (well, that's hard, and you shouldn't be able to just do it without problems!), or it could be a significant challenge, or maybe your stats are powered by Love or whatever, so you gotta see if the Establish-Relationship Scenes you've had with your PC's son are going to give you sufficient bonuses to find him in Yellowstone, at night. <br/><br/>To put that idea more succinctly, the type of stumbling block the game/the group puts forth is a reflection of their priorities. For example, plenty of games don't really question it if a player announces "I'm here in this other PC's scene!" or "We go there. Now what?" without challenging that framing. If it's just not important to keep the characters apart, then don't do it. "Not important" has plenty of different meanings, of course, but here it's short-hand for "we're not interested in that aspect of the story."<br/>That doesn't have to be about the CA, either - that could just indicate a focus on particular elements of setting or genre. A game with a stunt mechanic SHOULD be encouraging players to do crazy moves without it being as difficult as it'd be for a real person (Exalted, I'm looking at you); at the same time, being able to pull off stunts has nothing per se to do with CA - it's just a reflection of the swashbuckling, or wuxia, or other, related genre the game espouses.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322794/#Comment_322794" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T09:30:15+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  9:30AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2011 9:32AM by jenskot.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Guardian of Realism helps: <br/><br/>- create situations that require real trouble shooting<br/>- make the setting feel real<br/>- me feel that my choices matter<br/>- enhance immersion<br/>- maintain the consistency of the fiction we've been building<br/>- encourage players to pay attention to fictional details<br/>- reinforce "show, don't tell"<br/><br/>Unfortunately, abuse of the Guardian of Realism role has led to me to quit more games (especially Call of Cthulhu) than any other reason. <br/><br/>The problem is related to blocking but it is more than that.

But I didn't call her on it - nobody did. Wouldn't it have been nice for me if the GoR had stepped in and said something like, "But wait - aren't you all the way over here? How are you going to run down that long passageway in time?" Not so nice for her, though - she must have been imagining the scene differently than I was.

If there are no explicit mechanics to create adversity ("It's a really strong lock!") then the GM or whoever has to invent the adversity-- sometimes GMs are great at this (good experience for the players) and sometimes that are bad at it (bad experiences, blocking). The role of Provider of Adversity is separate, I believe, from that of Guardian of Realism. <br><br>As JD says, the GoR can be anyone (or multiple anyones) at the table; her conflicted role is to enforce conformity among competing visions of "reality" in the narrative (especially when one person's narration mistakes or confuses the narrative-- "No, wind drakes can't breathe fire, remember! That'd be insane!"). The Provider of Adversity often uses (should use?) recourse to the "reality" of the fiction in providing adversity ("... because you are weak and the lock is strong"), but that does not mean that the two roles are the same. Both can block, certainly, and both position themselves relative to the established fiction-- but then, that's true of <i>any</i> player's role.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322866/#Comment_322866" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T12:51:59+00:00" title="May  3, 2011 12:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After years of GMing as the Guardian of Realism, I learned that, no matter how willing you are to look to the fiction for answers at every turn, there are gonna be cases where you just have to make shit up.

Sounds like Guardian of the SIS to me.<br><br>Now, sometimes people interpret that as "Guard the SIS from the players" which seems sort of wrong.<br><br>Or "Ensure that the SIS is what I personally want it to be" which also seems sort of wrong.<br><br>Those bibles that tv series use to keep all the writers on the same page?  That's pretty much Guarding the SIS right there.<br><br>So taking away all those bad things, I think we're left with the Steward of the SIS.  His job is to make it clear to the players what's already in the SIS, and what the limits around the potential SIS are.  He doesn't own the SIS, but he is invested with the stewardship of it.<br><br>It comes up in Cthulhu games for the same reasons it comes up in all games set in established pre-defined Settings -- the integrity of the SIS is both well-defined and fundamental to the game.<br/><br/>As to what he's protecting the SIS from, well, there are at least two distinct threats:<br/><br/>1.  Unintentional wandering.  "You can't go down to the local bar because we're still in Prohibition, remember."  This is fine.<br/><br/>2.  Intentional jackassery.  "No, you can't be a 1930's ninja."  This can be problematic, but it's been well-discussed elsewhere.<br/><br/><br/>In terms of GNS stuff, this sort of role is primarily associated with Sim.  G and N don't care enough about Setting for it to generally be an issue; they just want to get to Situation already.  I suspect that's probably where most conflicts arise -- when G and/or N players are trying to get to Situation already, but the S GM is saying, hold on, the Setting can't let you do that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322878/#Comment_322878" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T13:20:22+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  1:20PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2011 1:21PM by Chroma.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting topic, but I think the terminolgy is a little misleading... this being isn't the "Guardian of Realism", but is more the "Guardian of Plausibility", working to allow players to agree that things "make sense" and don't break the "reality" of the shared imagined space, since such spaces could be wildly "unrealistic", but still require "plausibility" for enjoyable play.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, "GOP" is already established as meaning something else... *laugh*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322881/#Comment_322881" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T13:49:09+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  1:49PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2011 1:54PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chroma</cite> this being isn't the "Guardian of Realism", but is more the "Guardian of Plausibility"</blockquote>GoR = GoP + certainty of opinion                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322882/#Comment_322882" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T13:52:16+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  1:52PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>1.

The problem is, in many cases, your sense of realism has little to do with actual reality. <br/><br/>I've played CoC with history professors who have stopped a game because they couldn't agree about a historical fact, even though they were both experts in the field being discussed. I've countlessly seen professionals be wrong about their own expertise. Especially in the heat of the moment where there is something else on the line (can my character do something) and it's emotional for them. Emotions often cloud our judgment. And sometimes we can't tell the difference between "that's not realistic" and "I just don't want that to happen." <br/><br/>In my opinion, you can't have the Guardian of Realism both moderate a conflict and also have a stake in that conflict. It is a conflict of interest. It is also best not to make decisions in the heat of the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322926/#Comment_322926" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T15:53:06+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  3:53PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Railroading I certainly understand. It's a short step from what is often a fairly linear structure in the first place, but to my mind there's a big difference between 'you can't finally resolve these issues unless you go here, because this is where the problem fundamentally lives' and 'the players will go here whether they want to or not'. <br/><br/>I'm thinking particularly here of the players who deal with a haunted house by burning it to the ground, which is perhaps social asshattery, but from another perspective quite rational and reasonable, and the GMs who try to think of ways to block this undesired outcome. That sort of thing?<br/><br/>To my mind the "history professor" problem is one of the possible strengths of having a GM: someone whose vision of the game we're going to work with, whether we think we know better or not. Given that IMO games such as CoC need a strong GM role for maximum effect anyway, one may as well take advantage.<br/><br/>But can you unpack your last comment for me a little?

And if there is an agenda at play driving arguments of realism that has nothing to do with what is actually most realistic... my preference is to be either honest or have the least biased and most informed person available mediate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322956/#Comment_322956" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T18:22:17+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  6:22PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... it's really kind of the Guardian of Verisimilitude, isn't it?

Some things are obviously not realistic (e.g. you can't fire a bullet through a solid, 3'-deep stone wall... usually), but "real life" throws all kinds of surprises at us. My father used to tell me about his time in the army, and dealing with hand grenades. They had a "firing range" where they would practice throwing live grenades at targets, to get a sense of what it's like and what the effects are, etc.<br/><br/>One day, a soldier dropped a fragmentation grenade. It fell to the ground right between his legs and went off. The guy's cloak was torn to shreds, but there was no serious damage to him himself: every single fragment missed him, and he was basically just pretty badly shaken and bruised. Unbelievable.<br/><br/>Not much later, an experienced training officer (who knew quite well the threat radius for a grenade of that type) threw the final grenade far into the field (well beyond a safe distance) and turned around to walk away. A single fragment from the grenade hit him in the back, killing him almost instantly.<br/><br/>Now add to that the undefined nature of the gameworld space (the SIS), and there is just so much uncertainty about what a plausible outcome is that this kind of Guardian of Realism role becomes pretty subjective pretty quick.<br/><br/>As a GM, when playing in this style it's often a question of maintaining your own mental image of what's happening, maintaining your ability to provide adversity, and adding detail. Ideally, all these details and corrections add interesting material or interesting choices to play, meaningful things that propel the game forward, as opposed to blocking: when you think you have a good idea about how to get through that door, but the GM just says it can't be done, that sucks. But if it just makes your choices more interesting, or challenges you to be more creative, it can be quite cool.<br/><br/>You end up exploring the GM's psyche to a certain extent in this kind of play, and that can be fun, although the main feature is also the main drawback: play is only ever as good as the GM. (I find a lot of the more collaborative styles of play, or those guided by improv principles, include more surprises for everyone and tend to move along a little more dynamically. It's fun to discover stuff as you go along. But doing a strong-GM game like this can give you much more of a sense of entering an alien world or foreign reality, and perhaps some disagreements along these lines can even strengthen this feeling?) <br/><br/>As a player, it's also interesting. I've often been in games where what I considered plausible or sensible ideas "didn't work". But sometimes a much less sensible idea (or one that I didn't think was possible) would be accepted by the GM. Those situations feel a little like cheating to me as a player: I knowingly suggested something I don't think would work, and now it's been accepted. Do I speak up against myself (or a party member, in a team-based game), and thereby stall the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323318/#Comment_323318" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-06T10:33:00+00:00" title="May  6, 2011 10:33AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>One day, a soldier dropped a fragmentation grenade.

Like, people go to see the Matrix, and there's that part about using people to generate energy, and some people say "That's ridiculous" and others are like "Come on, it's comic book logic, it's fine."  Or in Spider-Man 2, when Harry Osborn is like, "Spider-man didn't save my life! He insulted me by touching me." (Talking psychological realism here.) Some are, "Oh, come on, how contrived." Others are like, "Comic book!" <br/><br/>So you kind of want your GoR to have his disbelief-suspension-height on par with everyone else's. Too high and the game's unrealistic.

I think task res is particularly prone to Reality Policing. <br/><br/>task res: the question the gm is supposed to answer is - If the dice say this (task) is successful, what (result) happens?<br/><br/>whereas with conflict res its - do you think its plausible that (result) could be achieved using (task)?  Then let the dice decide.<br/><br/>Its a lot easier to answer the second question as 'sure its possible' than it is to answer the first 'um, this is what I think is a plausible result given the circumstances'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323414/#Comment_323414" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-07T14:44:34+00:00" title="May  7, 2011  2:44PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>"Turns out your dead brother was really alive all this time, just hidden away, and now you're magically reunited in the seventh season?"

How'd they successfully fake his death?  How'd they keep him hidden?  What did he do during all that time?  Why is he back now?  Why didn't they just kill him, wouldn't that have been easier?  It changes a lot of history and tends to make you look for continuity gaffes, especially when you think they just pulled the whole idea out of their ass.<br/><br/>But a clone raises fewer questions about history.  The brother still died, you don't have to ask questions about what happened before, all you need to know is the crazy guy made a clone.  Whatever continuity police instinct you have doesn't get triggered and you can just accept the reveal for what it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323417/#Comment_323417" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-07T15:41:25+00:00" title="May  7, 2011  3:41PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Accounting, <br/>Exactly!
