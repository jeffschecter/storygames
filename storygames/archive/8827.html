But then, I've run a lot of DRYH at this point, and know what to do to make a party game work for my sensibilities as a GM.

Valerie fled the <br/>apartment, got ensnared in other situations...<br/><br/>DRYH is working for us because Amelia and myself are able to structure the narrative in a way that pleases both of<br/>us, it's most likely that we'll have just one more session. There was a bit of a showdown last night...<br/><br/>i keep digressing.
