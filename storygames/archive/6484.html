Imagine a Cthulhu <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poboy" rel="nofollow">po'boy</a>, with a Hellboy, X-Men, and Delta Green batter.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><b>Purpose:</b><br/>I am using this thread to invite commentary and critical review of the two sessions of Mythos Hunters Zero at Camp Nerdly last weekend. Comments and questions from other concerned parties are welcome as well, but I'm hoping to get some good discussion and riffing from the players as if we'd had a post-session debriefing.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><b>Origins and Evolution:</b><br/><br/>Mythos Hunters Zero is intended to be a setting shift for the soon-to-be released Tenra Bansho Zero, to make it more palatable for those who have trouble with anime. Admittedly, this was for one individual, whom I've run the game for successfully; since then, however, I found it to be a fun scenario to run and am delighted with the response it has received. I intend to release it as a free PDF along with the book's release if possible.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><b>Actual Play:</b><br/><br/>This scenario focuses on a team of supernatural powerhouses organized by an out of time leader from the future who saw the end of the world and came back to stop it all (or start it all, who knows?). The format of the scenario is that each character receives a spotlight scene wherein they have a difficult choice or are forced to act under pressure, and the leader's player is to watch carefully, and they'll use this knowledge to assign the team roles. Then, the leader has their spotlight, which shows everyone at the table this future End of Days, and what their leader is like when under pressure. Then, the leader chooses a mission from amongst some prewritten choices, and the adventure begins. It never runs the same twice, as I have no back history assigned to any character, the Zero acts are always different, and even if those were static, the leader picks the 'focus' for the session.<br/><br/>I ran two sessions - one short in both players and time, and a full session. I feel that I ended up using the first short session as a springboard for the second session - my guidance for the game didn't work as well as I'd hoped. I felt like I ran the most difficult game in my GMing history for the full session - I was tested on many fronts - rapid response, reincorporation, spotlight balancing, pacing, etc. The best part of both games was the delight as I realized that I understood the system well enough that I could just focus in my techniques. I wasn't flipping through rules or second guessing myself.<br/><br/>TBZ is a system for over the top action adventures where the characters tend to always do well and are only under the gun to succeed when both success and failure lead to interesting forks in the story. As a GM, I use the "always tend to do well" part as guidance for how to narrate part of the story - lots of successes mean something and only one success means something. Using that will be a key part of how to run the game for others, in my opinion.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>So, my players - jump in! Regale us with what was most interesting or most boring or needs working on! I love praise, but a critical dissection will be necessary to write this up for others to use.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143527/#Comment_143527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T11:26:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2008 11:26AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First comment: There is a special player at the table in Mythos Hunter Zero. They have a different role than the others and will help guide the adventure. It isn't the GM! One character is assigned Leader. They have an ability to distribute free successes to players if they obey what the Leader orders them to do. They also assign a Role, which grants a bonus on all rolls involved in that function.<br/><br/>First criticism: I didn't pimp the Role bonus die as much as I could have. It was neglected and either needs better integration on my part or to be reworked to become more obvious to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143549/#Comment_143549" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T12:22:56+00:00" title="May 12, 2008 12:22PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2008 12:24PM by jenskot.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Logo</i>, is fantastic and is what led me to ask you what the game was and sign up before even knowing what the rest of my schedule looked like. Your friendliness also sealed the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Pitch</i> (at nerdly), made me a little worried at first. The descriptions of the characters or more specifically the combination of characters made me feel the game would be less Hellboy / X-men (superpowers but still very human) and more extreme Justice League with an anime twist (feel less human, way more over the top). It wasn't a big enough of a concern that I didn't play but it made me nervous. The game itself actually felt very human and the zero scenes really helped push this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Zero Scenes</i>, were perfect. I loved that we had the option to frame the scene. I loved that it was a scene to test how we would react under stress. I loved that you awarded us a new destiny ability based on how we roleplayed the scene. I loved that the leader uses this scene to assign roles to the team members. I loved that after the Zero Scene, you can assign points to your destinies and signal to the other players which one was the most important to you. Can I use the word love again? My only question is... how much of this is in the actual game vs. your own GMing style?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>System vs. GM style</i>, are procedures like "players can frame their zero scenes" part of the game or elements you threw in? I liked the game. My hope is that these sort of procedures are explicit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Relationship Chart</i>, was exciting and eerily predictable and unpredictable at the same time. I loved that you use 2d6 to determine the results rather than introduce new dice. This is very much a personal preference but I felt spending resources to shift the results took a little bit away from the drama of using the chart. But I suspect many people will want this option.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Leadership Role</i>, was great but I feel we were lucky. The person who played the character made for a great leader. I don't think everyone will. Definitely something the GM should be very careful about. I love that the leader assigns roles. Although we often forgot to take the bonus. I love that the leader can generate free successes for the group as a whole. Having a physical indicator for the successes definitely helped.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Exploding Dice</i>, love them but I'm not sure why I wouldn't choose to roll them. Why not just make all hero dice exploding?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Damage Track</i>, love the idea of choosing to put my character in lethal situation and as I get closer to ending my story, I become more powerful and influential over that story. Although the game being Mythos Hunter, I wish sanity was addressed in some manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Attribute + Skill System</i>, slick and easy to use. The only thing I didn't like was rolling Empathy against my Destiny, "issues I care about" to generate Resolve Points, "resources to get what I care about". It just seems like something that should be more meta or about the player instead of the character. Why should 1 player have more say in the story than someone else because of a character skill / attribute? Why not just make the players roll their highest skill / attribute against their destinies? That way you are rolling the skill / attribute you care most about against the issues you care more about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Resolve vs. Fate points</i>, why have both? Especially since Fate points can be spent as Resolve points. Edit: I realize now that they are probably separate because once you spend more than 108 resolve points, you are out of the game and spending Fate points as Resolve points doesn't count against this limit. That makes sense. I just wonder if there is a way to streamline this.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143570/#Comment_143570" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T13:35:47+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  1:35PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><em>Pitch</em>(at nerdly), made me a little worried at first.

What game pitch would you make? If you were going to run this for a group, what would your Elevator Pitch be?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><em>Zero Scenes</em>, were perfect. ...

I don't think there was anything explicit about "danger or decision" and I know there wasn't any tie to the Leader. Adding a Destiny (Fate in the original system) was always a part, I think.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><em>System vs. GM style</em>, are procedures like "players can frame their zero scenes" part of the game or elements you threw in?

I think that the text either leaves it open to group preference or demands the GM to frame the scene. I know that in most campaigns, the GM is there for character creation and then the next SESSION is when play starts, and the GM has everything planned.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><em>Exploding Dice</em>, love them but I'm not sure why I wouldn't choose to roll them.

Exploding dice are NOT a part of the original system.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><em>Damage Track</em>, love the idea of choosing to put my character in lethal situation and as I get closer to ending my story, I become more powerful and influential over that story.

The only way in the core rules to gain Resolve (Kiai) is to spend Fate (Aiki) at the end of an Act. For the over the top feel, however, I felt it necessary to continuously pump Resolve into the system. I may need another way entirely.<br><br>Also, in a real Tenra Bansho campain, the game has a full three acts in addition to the Zero act. I've never gotten a game to run that long (obviously, as a con scenario has to be truncated). Maybe I should break up the acts quicker? This would allow the economy to flow as normal, but give more of a chance for points to come into the system.<br><br>Thanks, John!                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143577/#Comment_143577" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T13:55:02+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  1:55PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2008 2:03PM by jenskot.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Mark!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>"If you were going to run this for a group, what would your Elevator Pitch be?"</i><br/>\nX-men vs. Cthulhu in the 30s, almost over the top, with a human touch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>"Sanity is supposed to be that edge that Resolve moves further toward.

This means that that character is more "selfish", and doesn't care about the world out there: It's rare that something comes along that drives that person over the edge.<br><br>Meanwhile, a weaker character who has the capacity to feel for others, will totally bust out some Theme Music and Smackdown when those things are in jeopardy. She will have a greater capacity to love people and the world, and is thus more capable of, well, fucking it up on rare moments of Resolve-spending-spree.<br><br>Hope that makes sense!<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143682/#Comment_143682" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T08:39:41+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:39AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Andy! <br><br>What was the list of benefits you can buy with Resolve points? I know you can use Fate points as Resolve points but not vice versa? I'm having trouble remembering which benefits we bought with which currency. <br><br>What you are saying about Empathy makes perfect sense. It's a character's ability to empathize and manipulate people. Additionally, the more Empathy you have, the more you can motivate yourself to kick ass when the things you care about are in jeopardy. <br><br>Do the mechanics support that? They definitely seem to partially. I think (stress think) I remember spending Resolve points on protecting myself. I'm mainly asking if the use of Resolve Points awarded via Empathy are focused on empathizing and manipulating people and kicking ass over Destinies you care about. It may 100% do this and I'm just mixing up our use of Fate and Resolve points.
