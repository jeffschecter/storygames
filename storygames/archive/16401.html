We crafted a creepy, lonely, Alien-like vibe and ran with it. And there were a lot of scenes with people huddled around control panels or sitting in the dining nook having tense conversations. It felt very live action - at one point I got up to refill our water glasses and basically did it in character, carrying on the conversation. For the most part we stayed seated, but the roleplaying bits were pretty intense and had we been completely larping it, we would have been sitting anyway.<br/><br/>It made me wonder if there is a liminal space between the two forms, perhaps a sweet spot that could bring disparate enthusiasts together. I think Jeepform exists in or near this place, perhaps skewing toward the live action side.<br/><br/>Anyway I'm super interested in larp right now, and I'm filtering it through the lens of my many years of tabletop experience. I'm exploring what each form can offer the other, and I'd love your insight into that. <br/><br/>If you larp a lot, what sort of larp is it and how does that impact your engagement in tabletop play?<br/><br/>If you play a ton of tabletop but larp occasionally, same question but reversed. I'd just like to hear your thoughts on this topic if it is relevant to you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374673/#Comment_374673" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T06:27:14+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  6:27AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is such a place, yes. (That is, a nexus between tabletop and larp that is palatable from both sides.) I was exploring it a bit in 01-03 before I got seriously involved with the Forge. Based on my experiences, it is entirely feasible to create a game that would be compelling and recognizable to both larpers and tabletoppers at the same time and at the same table. My masterpiece in hindsight was "The Temple", a pretty straightforward simulationist-immersionist treatment of the titular Lovecraft story. The closed room environment made it easy for the game to be agnostic over the degree of live action, so while there was a GM and pacing and external events, everything that happened inside the submarine could be shifted freely over the continuum between the forms. I designed the game for an abnormally large table (up to 15 players, if memory serves), and there were premade characters for the convention environment, so it was quite larp-y in many ways.<br/><br/>I haven't larped since the '90s, though, and reading the last three paragraphs of your query I see that it's probably better for me to not draw any deeper conclusions here. Interested in seeing what others more currently involved have to say, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374674/#Comment_374674" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T06:54:45+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  6:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It made me wonder if there is a liminal space between the two forms, perhaps a sweet spot that could bring disparate enthusiasts together.</blockquote>\nObviously there is. I could quote Matthijs on "multiform" (or was it "multi-morph"?) role-playing, from the <i>Society of Dreamers</i> manual, and that fits nicely with my experience w/that game, which was in degrees of larp-ness, peaking in the playtest session with Norwegians and a Swede.<br/><br/>But a "liminal" experience of mine which more closely resembles yours, Jason, is playing Joe's <i>Ribbon Drive</i> \u2014 all of the times. It makes sense, considering most scenes involve 3-5 people sitting in a car and talking, which means the practical differences between "tabletopping" or "larping" those scenes would be minimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374675/#Comment_374675" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T07:01:43+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  7:01AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As you Jason I recently experienced an overlap playing around a table. There were many family dinners scenes were acting out happened naturally like doling out stew, getting up from the table and leaving, leaning over and whispering or just touching a shoulder. It happened in some other scenes but mostly the dinner ones. What I found was that the fiction had the mirror our physical positioning for the acting out to happen, we never rearranged ourselves in anticipation of acting.<br/><br/>Perhaps if you rearrange your physical positions at the start of each scene the acting out will happen more often. If the players setting the scenes do it it might even become natural.<br/><br/>My only LARP experiences have basically been drunken costume parties done in character so not much experience there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374676/#Comment_374676" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T07:09:43+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  7:09AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some versions/variants of freeform are in this space. And "Play With Intent" is (to me) all about exploring that space. Rafu mentions "Society of Dreamers" and multiform, which is also all about that space.<br/><br/>So it's pretty much the space I'm in these days. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>What I like from larp is the physicality of it. Using your own body - to shout, to dance, to sit in a corner and moan, to intimidate, to be servile - makes the experience more real, more physical, more in the moment. You are <i>there</i>, much more than when you tabletop.<br/><br/>However, tabletop has the weird effect of adding color in retrospect. Larp feels like a "real" memory - I was Matthijs in these clothes, I did these things. Tabletop feels like the memory of a dream - Euanthe was talking to the sphinx, the Greek mountains smelled of these herbs.<br/><br/>I like freeform/multiform because it lets you talk and plan, and it lets you improvise hugely - larp is very bound to its physical form; if you and I are both in costume, it's sort of stupid if I say "...and then my sword starts to glow and you see me transform into your ancestor!" In freeform, however, I can do this, because we're not in costume; there's no attempt whatsoever at verisimilitude/360 degrees/whatever. <br/><br/>Freeform, in this space, is augmented reality.

And of course; not always easy to tell apart (like twins, sometimes).<br/><br/>The different forms of role-playing games are:<br/>- physical (larp)<br/>- verbal (rpgs)<br/>- literary (pbf/pbm/pbm)<br/>- visual (mmorpg)<br/><br/>I find it interesting to think that the different forms of role-playing games also correlates to each their narrative artform:<br/>- physical (larp) - theatre<br/>- verbal (rpgs) - storytellling<br/>- literary (pbf/pbm/pbm) - literature<br/>- visual (mmorpg) - film<br/><br/>For myself I have experienced a lot of verbal rpgs that plays out like a larp. I've made some of them myself. I've played larps that resembles rpgs too. We need to observe these two forms as distinct entities, in order to discuss the strengths of each form, and to design on its particular strengths. <br/><br/>But the divide is not something we may expect to obey us in all circumstances; there are lots of games crossing the border we have invented. And those games are often very, very interesting.

To me it sounds like the latter, in which case, defining it as either larp or tabletop seems outside the point, right?<br/><br/>To me, playing a larp with really structured resolution mechanics (mostly stuff in the American larp tradition, like MET and Shelter in Place) feels much more like playing a tabletop game with really structured resolution. But playing tabletop games with much more freeform resolution (Silver &amp; White, Metrofinal) feels much more like freeform larp. So the way players engage the mechanics and each other seem more important that how they perform play. Formal resolution leads to a play experience that feels more like a game. Freeform resolution leads to a play experience that feels more like a church service.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374688/#Comment_374688" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T08:33:36+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  8:33AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have an agenda.

The act of building handouts or character sheets or whatever is a way for me to really dig into the material, understand it, and make sense of it from an information design POV. It's just what I do. So I created handouts for The Tribunal, which it doesn't completely need, and J. Tuomas Harviainen's comment on my effort was "Interesting, you've made it more accessible to tabletop players".

Our characters arrived in some tomb that had been disturbed. We began to use the short hallway leading to bedrooms of the apartment we were playing in. The lights were out in these bedrooms, the hallway was dark. At one point, to illustrate where a body was laying, the GM laid down and had us show how we were approaching the body.  One of us got close enough to touch, but nothing happened for 5 seconds - then he grabbed that players wrist. It freaked us all out and our characters started panicking.<br/><br/>I can't stand the idea of LARPing completely (esp with dozens of players or more). I want the rules and structure that tabletop allows, or at least the minimalist structure that Jeepform promises.<br/><br/>To make it more rote and common, I could see posing the question (either to the table to just an internal assessment) on whether or not getting physical could help out.  Or, perhaps just in general the answer is "yes" in scene framing, and only "no" when outside of peoples' comfort zone (e.g. a gladiatorial match, or flying super heroes).  Simple stuff like whether to remain seated or stand could be the baseline.<br/><br/>On the other hand, despite some great experiences, I am not really convinced. I'm thinking about the game I'm running, a sci-fi first extra-solar colony setting, and the idea of moving around for scenes just doesn't worth the discomfort of being more in my body (which is a purely psychological discomfort). It's not really something that's a whole lot of fun to push.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374691/#Comment_374691" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T08:54:08+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  8:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, you seem to be interest in the theatrical threads along the line of larp &lt;-&gt; jeepform &lt;-&gt; tabletop.

When these discussions come up on Story Games, we invariably talk about the former, but not the later.

At the time it did seem normal and natural)<br/><br/>"tabletop" is a legacy term, a relic from the time of lead miniatures and dungeon geomorphs. When we play we are communicating and we use the table only to have a place to put the sheets, food and beverages. From there, is only a matter of scale, of pushing some forms of communication over others, and you get jeepform (or you get A taste for Murder played "live" with the table used only to roll dice, as I like to play sometimes).<br/><br/>So, if tabletop isn't about any table at all, what it's about? It's about having the means to narrate and describe something, and not being limited to acting out the scene.  LARP is limited in the kind of communication that it allows, but this limitation means that there is no need for everybody to know what the others are doing all the time (or a GM that do) anymore<br/><br/>An hybrid of these kind of pgs? I don't know, in practical terms it's something I can see (limiting the narration, acting out the descriptions, etc.) as something that make one of them more similar to the other, but it still would be one or the other...<br/><br/>(Once upon a time, I thought that Jeepform was that hybrid, but a lot of discussions with LARP aficionados convinced me that the Jeepform I like are much more similar to "tabletop" games than LARPS)<br/><br/>Apart from these "theory" thoughts, in practice I noticed that I like very much a lot of acting in my tabletop games, and a single imagined space in my LARPs, so I suppose I am trying to get to that middle point...<br/><br/>(it's difficult for me to even use "tabletop" talking about rpgs, it's specific American term, in Italy nobody would use "tabletop" to mean a rpg. At most one would use "pen and paper", but usually it's only "role-playing game")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374697/#Comment_374697" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T09:20:00+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  9:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

In the same vein, I think hacking or prepping for the next adventure (making new monsters, etc.) plays that same role in more traditional play: you're taking the game, internalizing it, and then spitting the game back out.

It seemed like they spent a long time exchanging poetic small talk, compared to "solving" the plot.<br/><br/>To me, watching larpers sort of larp their tableop suggests that tabletop is often more about the group narrative, while larp has more tendencies toward individual narrative; tabletop is more about the overal story, while and larp is more about the personal experience -- sort of the difference between doing and being, if that doesn't sound too ridiculous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374708/#Comment_374708" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T10:06:04+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 10:06AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Read Lizzie's book.

Mostly. For the most part, players say what their characters say and do what their characters do.<br/><br/>But Jeepform plays down the costuming, staging stuff and only uses the most minimalist and abstract of props. So it doesn't do a lot of the "mapping the physical reality to the game reality" stuff. They might do things like placing a 4 chairs in 2 rows to represent the seating arrangements in a car, but that's about it (from everything I've read, this is how they do it. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)<br/><br/>And Jeepform plays down the simultaneous action / disparate narrative stuff. They use small groups of players and all the players are present for 1 scene happening at a time.<br/><br/>Also, Jeepform uses a lot of tabletop-y handling. They have a GM cut and frame scenes. They have a GM use bird-in-ear to nudge players toward things that will ratchet up the drama and conflict and such. They have players monologue their inner feelings (which isn't super common in tabletop, sure, but it's even less common in larp).<br/><br/>So yes, Jeepform makes use of larp-style communication. But in other ways, it's more like one of the more experimental indie tabletop games like Penny For My Thoughts.<br/><br/>Yes, though, it does make good use of exploring that in-between space to create powerful games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374711/#Comment_374711" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T10:23:06+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 10:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone, this is very useful and interesting to me.<br/><br/>I like the idea of perfect knowledge that tabletop (sorry Moreno) provides - five of us who all know everything that transpires.

We always experience different things out of a shared group activity when it comes down to it, but by employing those techniques, the difference is expanded and becomes more noticable.<br/><br/>The "speaking and doing in character" aspect has been explored quite a bit. When you speak out an argument rathern than just saying "I convince him to let us in, what do I roll for that?" you're exploring part of that continuum. I would argue that most people who are considered good roleplayers are called that because they stay away from the total abstraction end and engage in dialogue instead. Adding movement in is an extension of that.<br/><br/>Probably the least commonly explored of the 3 differentiators is the mapping of physical reality to game reality. Some GMs have done this by using props, especially interactive props. If you have to actually put together the puzzle that your character is putting together, you're exploring this space a bit. Also, some GMs do a little bit with decor and mood lighting and such to help engage their player's senses along these lines. And I would say that the OSR technique of mapping out a dungeon, which has gotten a lot of attention lately, is an exploration of this space.<br/><br/>So, yeah, there's been a long history of exploring these spaces in very traditional games. But like I said, it's usually only one aspect at a time. Tabletop players tend not to want to get "too larp-y" in their play, like they might accidentally catch it by being exposed, like you do with gayness (j/k).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374717/#Comment_374717" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T10:42:30+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 10:42AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2012 10:43AM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>In addition to looking at jeepform, which meets your criteria, you should also look at blackbox larp.<br/><br/>Hopefully Levi Kornelson will drop in and say more about it. He's an expert on it and I only know what I've heard from him over several years. But from my understanding, it works like this.<br/><br/>Players get together in a location - usually a blackbox theatre. One or more stage spaces are designated. Players have their characters to play and are costumed, but costuming is not a huge concern (I think you could skip costumes and also jump characters, really).<br/><br/>A player sets a scene on a stage by writing it on a post it note. They jump on stage with some other players and start acting out the scene. The post it is there so that if someone comes along who didn't hear the stage setting would know where it's taking place. Other players can bring their characters on or off the scene as it seems fitting to do so.<br/><br/>While anyone is off stage, they are audience to the other scenes that are happening.<br/><br/>So basically, it's kind of like jeepform play done for larger groups and without some of the techniques like bird-in-ear.<br/><br/>I think you'd find it interesting to spend a few moments reading up on it. Levi has posted threads in various places about it - Forge, rpg.net larp forum, etc.<br/><br/>It looks like my dissection of where the differentiators are has helped you see what spaces you are interested in exploring more of, Jason.

This is probably my bias toward story over character, as Lizzie notes.</blockquote>\nWell, I'd say that part of it is your habit of being used to knowing the whole story of an event.<br/><br/>I'd suggest trying, at least twice (not once, that's a horribly subjective sample size for just about anything), a solid pregen game with ~20ish characters. If you get a chance to play The Final Voyage Of The Mary Celeste, which is now available online for free (Don't read it before playing, though. Half the fun is in the spoiler stuff.), jump at it. Maybe even go both feet in and try an InterCon once.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to convert you or convince you that you are wrong or anything. Just trying to suggest a way to really try out a solid disparate narrative experience a few times before being sure that you don't like it. Also, you might learn something interesting about disparate perceptions that you can bring back to tabletop games.<br/><br/>Also, I think it's worth noting that story is something that typically happens after a game, not during (unless it's a REALLY long game, in which case stories happen during). Because story can't happen until there is an ending. Story is what happens when we have a conclusion and we construct a narrative of what lead to that conclusion. Story is the process of applying causation as a way of understanding outcomes.<br/><br/>So in a bigger larp with simultaneous action, there are a lot of outcomes, many of which any individual knows nothing about. But for what happens to you, there are still your outcomes and what lead to them. There is still your story.<br/><br/>That's why a lot of time is spent after a large larp talking about what happened. That's the process we go through to find out the things that affected you that you didn't know about at the time (character X's secret motivation to thwart your plans, for example). During that process, you add detail to the narrative of what happened to your character.<br/><br/>It can be a really fascinating process. It's different from what happens in a smaller tabletop game where people know what's going on. It's even more different from a jeepform game, where players are encouraged to monologue, so you get even more exposure to what's going on in people's heads during the game (which can then affect the remainder of the event, which is also really neat).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374732/#Comment_374732" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T11:26:05+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 11:26AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I definitely will try it.

I had a teacher that wanted to impress upon us how easy it can be for a jury deliberation to become something out of Twelve Angry Men. Turns out it's pretty easy, at least when a bunch of teenagers are involved. The main thing I took away from it was that the greater the reality of the experience the more profound of an effect it can have on the participants. That sounds obvious, but at that point I had never thought about that sort of thing in a role-playing context. <br/><br/>So, "reality of the experience". The fewer, and less distracting, the elements are that you're surrounded by that don't simulate, emulate, or reinforce the scenario of play the more likely it is that at some point you'll buy into that scenario on an emotional level. That buy-in won't even happen consciously. The main impediment that I think tabletop play has in this regard is the artifacts of the ritual. We usually have character sheets, dice, cards, play aids, books, and what have you spread out before us. They frame and shape the situation in a particular way, and act as interpretive layers between the players and the scenario. Their form and function is also usually in no way related to the fiction in the scenario. It seems to me that being able to use objects that can reflect the nature of the scenario, turning props and surroundings into system, could go a long way towards pulling a tabletop experience towards that nexus between it and LARP. Of course, a lot of that may rely on how closely the scenario mirrors sitting around at a table, in your living room, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374744/#Comment_374744" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T12:12:51+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 12:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Tell me more about "playing before you play".

It's a simple phrase, and most sorts of game prep don't really fall into it. When it does happen, though, it seems very pointless to many gamers, myself included. My impression is that it's more common in more theatrically oriented groups, larps included, perhaps because it's easier to mix up important content and support structures on those games.<br/><br/>Note that "playing before play" properly should only refer to situations where you're actually going over the same important content twice. If the game happens to be one where we know the plot in advance but the creative agenda is about seeing the emotional states of the characters involved, then it's not "playing before play" to outline the plot in advance. However, if you also outlined the emotions involved, then you would be "playing before play" by pre-arranging the important details. The actual play would be merely acting out the things already hashed out in advance. That's properly called theater, not gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374745/#Comment_374745" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T12:13:07+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 12:13PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really good point, Chris.

Make sure to workshop those mechanics before the game (during lunch, perhaps, or a pre-dinner the night before). Preferably work in drama-game style exercises during the workshop that the players use to create their characters and establish relationships. Then you'll have made your own Nordic style larp game. Then make sure to take pictures and document it afterwards and send it in for next year's KP book.<br/><br/>Oooh. And make sure to include a solid discussion of lines and veils and talk about how that affected the game in your writeup. Then you'll have addressed an aspect that the Nords are currently focused on and struggling with, and they'll be even more interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374751/#Comment_374751" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T12:39:36+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 12:39PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend of mine went to an organized murder mystery with meal with the twist.....it was a wake for his relative or friend I cant remember which.<br/>\n<br/>\nsome of the actual guest were actors of the event.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when this gorgeous bird introduced herself ,asking how he was related to the deceased he spluttered then twigged what was happening and started some spiel he remembered from his background.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said the moment was bizarre but introduced him to lots of plot, which he then spread in conversation later in the evening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374753/#Comment_374753" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T12:56:01+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 12:56PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Playing before you play:<br><br>"OK, in this scene I want to ask for the hand of the princess."<br/></br></br></blockquote>\nOk.

Very helpful.)<br><br>Ideally (and this is an important word in this sentence) that's super different from what a good after game discussion after a good disparate narrative larp is like.<br><br/>Ideally, you had a well developed character (probably a combination of what was developed preplay and what happened in play) and had some goals (probably some of which were given preplay and some were discovered during play) and some relationships (probably some of which were established preplay and some discovered during play). And ideally, you went through the game and engaged with your goals and relationships, while also engaging with new ones, and you had a good time doing that.<br/><br/>So right after the game, you've reached some sort of conclusion and can create a story in your head about that, based on your experience.<br/><br/>And then, everyone gathers and tells about who they were and what they did and stuff.<br/><br/>And as you listen and laugh, many additional, related stories come out. Some were tightly intwined with yours and give you mindblowing insight into the fact that, for example, a person you thought was helping you was secretly your enemy and was the reason you failed to accomplish one of your goals and if only you'd asked that one girl about it, she'd totally have told you that and that whole outcome would have been different. And other stories you hear are less closely related, but still interesting because they have one or two connection points with the experience you had.<br/><br/>So now, after having played this game, you have not just one story of what happened, you have this whole intertwined network of stories about what happened, like some crazy postmodern novel told by 20 unreliable narrators talking about the same event.<br/><br/>Ideally that's what happens.<br/><br/>What actually happens is usually less than that ideal, but when luck holds you get pretty close. And picking the right games to play helps.

I ran John Wick's Curse of the Yellow Sign pt1 a couple of years back, and had the player of the first casualty start playing the part of the ghostly tormentor monster/NPC, bby running around the table and whispering horrible things to the other players, kinda-sort Bird in Ear style and it worked really well. I also got a chance to meet up with john kim and some of his pals who'd been running a very lomg-term coC campaign for a session, and a good bit of that was run very casually, in-character, and was quite a bit like a mid-sized larp played indoors in the hosts' home, with people moving around in different areas and having individual conversations, even while some part of the gatherde players were getting more traditional TTRPG type play with the GM.<br/><br/>IIRC, a classic old CoC scenario from UnspeakableOath magazine called <i>In Media Res</i> also involves a good bit of advice on how to make that scenario almost parlor larpish, as does <i>Grace Under Pressure</i> , another well-know classic, this one set on a submarine.<br/><br/>Some forms of table top gaming, especially with multiple players also tend to go a little LARPy. Reports on the original braunstein games certainly suggest people were doing more than sitting around measuring and moving lead people while waiting for their turn to go. Diplomcy games can tend toward this direction as well, and i've seen older articles talking about people really getting into the character of their nation's diplomat, to the extent of creating a personality and game-name for themselves. i wish i still had the articles, as i believe they predate D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374777/#Comment_374777" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T15:40:40+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  3:40PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems to be a direction different from the one this thread has taken, but my friends and I have sometimes discussed what the intersection would look like if it involved hand puppets.

I'd add in also that there's usually a unity of time and space.  I don't mean wysiwig, like Rob says, but that usually the action of a larp takes place as one continuous event.  You generally don't skip time, and if you want to change the scene you generally have to actually move in space (like moving to another room, or going to another area of the campsite.) I can think of exceptions, but it definitely affects the writing - you know you can't skip the routine 'dull' bits of the characters' lives to get to the exciting car chase or whatever, so you try to write it so that it's all exciting/interesting.  Most larps I've been to were trying to mash up key points of all their characters' lives so that they all kind of mix up together and explode into story.  Tabletop games can be more liberal in their timing (even if the actual time spent playing is the same), because they can just jump forward three months with the actual consequences of what the players did.<br/><br/>I've run a few games that were sitting in the intersection - technically they were larps, but the setting was a group of friends getting together for a conversation, so they were mostly sitting around the room talking.  I had some food and drink as props related to the theme of the conversation (in one, they were tied to game mechanics, which worked out pretty cool in one run, as the player who wasn't eating and thus not getting the same magic realism experience as everyone else had also taken the most skeptical stance in the conversation).  And people came who 'only' do tabletop, and said that they had a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374782/#Comment_374782" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T16:58:31+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  4:58PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2012 5:00PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point, Stephanie.<br/><br/>Maping time to reality and maping space to reality very often go hand in hand. Usually when a game is flexible on one, they're flexible on the other in the same way - you cut and frame scenes, which may include skipping forward in time past the boring stuff like travel. <br/><br/>Wysiwyg larps tend not to do that, or do it very little. Liminal games such as jeepform and blackbox have mechanics for how to do scene/time framing (in fact, it's among the very few mechanics those liminal games usually have).<br/><br/>But occasionally some games address time in a way that's different from how they address space. I just read in Lizzie's book about a game that, in order to express insanity in a game with crazy people, set a scene where players were cleaning up after a party and then days later, had the actual party (it was a game that took place over several days. And I assume the cleanup scene involved actually cleaning up a room.)<br/><br/>But yeah, games that are "more larp", if you will, tend to not use time as a flexible thing where you can skip ahead (or back) to the good stuff.<br/><br/>In fact, for a lot of adventure larps, time is very commonly used as a primary power resource. For example, in many such games, you spend magic points to power special powers. And those magic points typically refresh either in a trickle (such as one point every minute or five or ten) or in clock cycles (all your points come back every quarter day - 6 am, noon, 6 pm, midnight, for example). Time is one of the common ways adventure larps use other types of power limiters instead of randomizers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374787/#Comment_374787" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T17:14:54+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  5:14PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>This seems to be a direction different from the one this thread has taken, but my friends and I have sometimes discussed what the intersection would look like if it involved hand puppets.

I was surprised to discover it doesn't involve actually playing with hand puppets, just drawing them and talking about it.<br/><br/>That being said, Puppetland uses actual time mapping, while not using other larp vectors (I'm thinking vectors might be the right word instead of differentiator, at this moment).

We decided to set it in Gothic-Punk Canberra and call it "Canberra by Night".<br/><br/>Now, Canberra is a pretty small place. Even including its half-absorbed Siamese twin city Queanbeyan, on the guideline of one leech per 100,000 urban population we worked out that we were going to have the entire vampire population of Canberra-Queanbeyan in each group that played. Since nobody much else is even relevant to vampires, that meant that any NPCs the GM might play would be minor characters, and all important conflict was going to be within the party. So Andrew and I, leaning heavily on his experience of writing freeforms, stewed up a brew of lust, intrigue, hatred, and betrayal and designed five <i>heavily symbolic</i> characters trapped in a mesh of ambitions and resentments that all related to one another. There was a precipitating incident (the murder of the utterly vile prince of Canberra), and the adventure consisted of, basically, everything coming to a head. The characters were LARP characters, but their number (five) was tiny for a LARP, and the game was played (mostly) at a table, with a GM doing bit part NPCs and minor bits of conventional GMing. We advertised it as a hybrid of tabletop and freeform game\u2014I think "multiform" might have been the term we used\u2014and that was the way it ran.<br/><br/>The essence, I think, was to have conflicted issues among the PCs, with a robust crucible but no <i>dynamic</i> external threats requiring the GM to represent them. It helped that there was no prospect of playing on after the end of the session: with no pressure to keep the party viable PCs could pursue their ambitions and resentments where-ever they led.<br/><br/>It was pretty successful, and some iterations got quite intense (personal horror and all that). It was in <i>Canberra by Night</i> that I GMed a woman into shock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374842/#Comment_374842" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T08:47:03+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  8:47AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To follow up, Jason, on the character/story thing:<br/><br/>To me the cool thing about Nordic larp is that it combines often combines the story concern of tabletop with the character concern of larp. The Dogma 99 manifesto, for example, forbids main plot as opposed to plot for all characters. In fiction writing, this sort of corresponds to the inside/outside story. In literary fiction, characters undergo an emotional transformation (the inside story) that is mirrored by their circumstances (the outside story).<br/><br/>In larps, this concept of no main plot, only plot for everyone seems to do away with the puzzle plot; instead everyone gets an emotional plot or goal (an inside story -- something like "find love" or "survive prison" or "deal with human mortality") and external plot scopes down to the setting. Even if you don't know the particular ins and outs of what every character did, players still know what happened in a general way, sort of substituting for that absolute tabletop knowledge.<br/><br/>The debrief, then becomes not necessarily a tool for relating what happened during the larp, but for discussing the emotions raised. And interestingly, at the Solmukohta safety panel, a couple organizers suggested that the most important part of the debrief is constructing the meaning of the game and declaring that no one was harmed; saying it sort of makes it so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374843/#Comment_374843" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T08:49:58+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  8:49AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lizzie, that's hugely interesting.

Events that happened in a place had an impact. Players would write down the impact of a fight or an action in the locale by adding bits of color (bullet holes, graffiti, smells, etc.).<br/><br/>If a PC was injured, they could go to the hospital to recover by lying on a bed and writing me a couple of small notebook pages worth of text about their recovery.<br/><br/>Task resolution was based largely on sending PCs on various mini-quests that forced them to either create more fiction or make hard choices between two different things they desired.<br/><br/>If two PCs had a conflict, they would use both their bodies and words to simulate the fight, but the loser of the fight would basically be put on the Owe list for guaranteed character praise in the post-larp discussion (which I also see as a ritual that's an integral part of larp game mechanics).<br/><br/>The system generally worked because we had 5 GMs and 12 players... a wonderful ratio! The GMs I saw not so much as omniscient authorities but as active <i>counter-players</i> who took on the roles of various NPCs and were there explicitly to push back against the PCs and/or make their lives more interesting.<br/><br/>In effect, we designers who have grown up with tabletop and are now moving into larp design are taking the lessons we've learned from tabletop with us. And they're producing interesting results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374955/#Comment_374955" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T14:12:49+00:00" title="April 29, 2012  2:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of Cthulhu tabletop gaming turns into LARP without much effort.

Sure, some friends (and in-game allies) might debrief at the pub after a session, but that's almost always still "quasi-in-character" in that folks don't spill secrets or explain motivations. I might not portray my PC... but I'm not going to BETRAY my PC, either.<br/><br/>Hmmm... new point: LARP is less resilient to an abundance of OOC information ebing in the game; TT can (somehow) better handle separation of character and player knowledge. Now, is that a function of the forms or of the players I've seen in the forms (in all varieties)? Not so sure, there.<br/><br/>I will disagree, however, with those posters saying LARP is "about character" while TT is "about plot". I'd say that's walking AWAY from Jason's question about the overlap/liminal space. Further, I'd point out that the vast majority of my LARP experience is with highly plot-driven play, managed by teams of GMs with volunteer NPCs. Now, as it turns out, I tend to make PCs with a lot of "character" to them, so that I can enjoy being IC even when there's no plot to engage or pursue (or I'm tired, or all the GMs are asleep) and we're sitting by the fire.<br/><br/>But, no... not a whole lot of "touchie-feelie" character exploration in my LARP background, unless it's done by the players, out of a personal desire to explore that space while away from the "main events" of the actual LARP game.<br/><br/>Oh, and again: I'm talking about on-going LARPs, not romantic one-shots, Jeepform hugfests, or psychotherapy-as-game events. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375059/#Comment_375059" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T07:23:38+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  7:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I'm back where I started with this inquiry, which is fine.
