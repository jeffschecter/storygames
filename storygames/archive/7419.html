But, I do think that good gaming on IRC depends on the quality of the group. More so than FTF. Some of the issues I have seen are:<br/>\n1) Chat lag - People not sure if someone is AFK or typing something big or...<br/>\n2) Cross Chat - two people responding to the same narration out of order<br/>\n3) Attendance - It's hard to get people to show up on time...<br/>\n4) The "Anonymity" factor - sometimes people will say/do stuff in chat they would enver do FTF<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things that are really great<br/>\n1) Nobody "does voices" via text<br/>\n2) People can do longer, more flowery narration without getting interrupted, etc.<br/>\n3) With chat logging, you can easily keep a record fo what happened.<br/>\n4) People can play at more flexible times, since they don't have to show up anywhere, get dressed, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good luck man!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164986/#Comment_164986" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T13:21:44+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  1:21PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            btw, since i've been extra interested in <i>Bliss Stage</i> lately, if Elliott Belser reads this, can you tell me about your game and what problems you had due to the format and good ways to overcome them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164988/#Comment_164988" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T13:24:19+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  1:24PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played most flavors of White Wolf games on IRC, Exalted being the current (going on 4 years soon O.o) one.

Either everyone waits for them (this is the nice way) or they get lost in the shuffle and whatever they were responding too has scrolled off the screen by the time they post.<br/>7) You can't split the pizza bill with people who aren't there.  Some people consider it to not be a social activity without everyone being physically present in the room.  (see also, Attendance)<br/><br/><br/>and the greatness:<br/>5) Ability to have IC and OOC channels - this is wonderful.  You can discuss mechanics and make off-color comments without getting lost as to where you were in the game, or really interrupting the flow of IC stuff.  <br/>6) The game fiction can be read back over easily to refresh memory, share with others, or just enjoy as a story.<br/>7) Dice scripts simplify/speed math (tells you how many successes automatically, etc.) and you can program new ones to do rather elaborate things if you are so inclined.<br/>8) I find immersion (by which I personally mean right now, 'getting into the character's headspace') much easier without having the actual people there to be dissonant with my mental image of their characters.

I knew there was one more on the tip of my tongue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah, the channel thing is a plus/minus on its own as well. the more channels a game takes, the harder it is for all the players to remain involved with each other. I played in a HQ game that had like 4 IC channels and an OOC channel and I quite honestly didn't know what was going in in most of them. And it was hard to get socially engaged with the Players when there was no common medium to discuss (I thought we were going to die, your character did something cool, etc). But, it did offer a way for players to pursue their own subplots without derailing the groups main activities. So, it, again, relies on your group/GM and what you want from the game.<br/>\n  Hope that helps!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165015/#Comment_165015" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T14:51:35+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  2:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D,<br/>Yeah definitely.

I haven't really got a solution to this kind of thing; it's the same thing around a table - the group has to develope their sync over time - it's just that it's a lot easier when you can use eye contact and signal stuff through body language.<br/><br/>With Panty Explosion that issue kind of goes away as soon as someone grabs the dice. Once you start a conflict everyone gets a chance to act - we've been using the alphabetical list over the characters that's automagically created by just being in the same IRC channel. Does someone wanna make a response action? Just wave your e-hand. Rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>A strong point with using Panty Explosion for IRC-play is that everyone in the group can still be involved even though only a few of the characters are "on screen" in a particular scene: a soon as someone initiates a conflict another player will have to narrate (best friend narrates success, rival narrates faliure). This way no one is completely left out - just make sure the friend/rival-connections are evenly distributed, anything else would just be dumb. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Finally; using a dice bot has proven extremely handy for this game where you have pools of dice that are drained and refreshed frequently. So... thumbs up for Panty Explosion online!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165051/#Comment_165051" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T17:59:18+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  5:59PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>What games have people played via IRC or other text-based internet chat programs?<br/>What are problems with gaming this way, and what are some ways these problems can be surmounted?<br/>What games work pretty well via IRC and what games are really really bad for playing this way?</blockquote>\nI've played a couple of WoD games this way.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is attendance and focus. I have no idea how to surmount them. Since it's online, people tend to act more casually - commiting with less forethought, dropping out with less warning. There's also distractions of food, bathroom breaks, family members around, etc. There's less of a "game space" for individuals, so interruptions occur more easily. Perhaps givign people concrete times in which to create a space to set aside might be good.<br/><br/>Another issue is typing over each other.  You can develop codes to use to state "I'm done now" or "I'm not done yet" like ellipses, with perhaps a two or three entry maximum (they can continue past, but others can interrupt). For action and task level games, it's a bit of a bear.<br/><br/>I've only tried the WoD ones and although I think games like HQ, Polaris, and such might work better, the idea of gaming online just puts me in a "no gaming is better than bad gaming" state of mind. And I used to use IRC as a social tool, but RPGs online just didn't seem as social.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165055/#Comment_165055" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T18:14:26+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  6:14PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Complicated works really well on IRC, and even has a java app to help facilitate play.

I played about four sessions. The biggest obstacle was scheduling. We had West Coast players and someone in France in the same game, so we would get together when we could for a long session (like 6 hours). It just didn't work out. <br/><br/>There never really was a problem with typing order or anything like that. The game was a lot of fun. <br/><br/>We also ran a one-shot of Don't Rest Your Head -- that worked really well too. In that game we framed scenes aggressively and kept the scenes short. This seemed to help with the inherent slowness of play-by-chat. <br/><br/>I don't mush as much as I used to -- it just feels too hard to commit to the time that seems to be expected. I'd really like a game where dropping in occasionally would work, because I like the sense of a persistent world and asynchronous play happening on a mush. <br/><br/>For what it's worth a Spirit of the Century mush (Victorianesque Mars) is under development right now, and I have designs simmering for In a Wicked Age and The Shadow of Yesterday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165132/#Comment_165132" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T21:58:24+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  9:58PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: george</cite>There never really was a problem with typing order or anything like that.

I did too. I lost touch with them (and fear they might have lost their shine compared to MMO's) but I LOVED MUSH's. I never really thought about that seeming disconnect. It does seem to really highlight the problems I pointed out, I think. Playing a MUSH, people tended to devote more attention to it when playing, or appeared to. Perhaps it was an illusion, but if someone had to take an important phone call or get something to eat, they would usually have their character depart and the game wasn't stopped for anyone else. I bet looking at MUSH's for tips and tricks to improve IRC would be a good thing.<br/><br/>As for OOC in IRC, (we would put it in parentheses). Anything a character said "Was in quotes."
