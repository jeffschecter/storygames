I can attest that I personally have enjoyed facilitating all these games and look forward to doing so again at the London Indiemeet, Conception, Concrete Cow and anywhere else that I can ensanre the unwary. Anyway, if you have the time, please feel free to have a look and let me know what you think of these:<br/><br/>Whatever the Cost: an updated version of my light horror game that does the opposite of Cthulhu Dark by  Graham Walmsley and lets you skip much of the investigation to go straight to punching Cthulhu to death.<br/><br/>[Excision: a more polished version of my contemporary covert ops/conspiracy game, with the missing rules for assets and liablitles reinstated. This is a player driven, GM moderated diceless game that combines elements of Leverage, Spooks and Kolchak: the Night Stalker.<br/><br/>The Next Big Thing: the first published edition of my freeformish, near future, hard SF space opera game, in which the PCs are spearheading a major engineering project, guiding it from inception to conclusion.<br/><br/>Blood &amp; Water: an unofficial 'Being Human' RPG with the strong central friendships between the characters heavily foregrounded in both story and mechanics. I liked this game so much at Indiecon that I've also written two hacks in the appendices, one of which I expect Scott Dorward will be very pleased to see...<br/><br/>Links to all these games  are on the front page at <a href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
