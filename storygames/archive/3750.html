But what would they get if they <i>weren't</i> Chorus?  Oh, I know ... how about the right to frame scenes?"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was thinking ... suppose you have three players, and they each have main characters, but they may also choose to either have Chorus role or Scene Framing role.  I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, that players will choose to frame scenes that include their main characters, most of the time.  Let's examine the options:<br/>\n<br/>\nThree Chorus, no Scene-framing:  Whatever the first scene is in the game, that is <i>it</i>.  All the action occurs there, with a wide and varying panoply of minor characters coming into and out of the scene.  I'm not convinced that I love that as a concept, but it's certainly <i>interesting</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo Chorus, one Scene-framing:  The one scene-framing person's character is the central focus of the narrative ... the camera follows them.  There are two other characters who appear to be the central nodes of the <i>world</i>, but who probably do much of their activity off-stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne Chorus, two Scene-framing:  I think, in this case, the <i>Chorus</i> character becomes the central focus of the narrative ... or at least the thread that connects the two focus characters.  Simply because the abilities of the Chorus allows them to insert themselves or some representative in <i>every scene</i>, whereas there is a good chance that a scene-framing player may find their character written out of scenes framed by other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Chorus, three Scene-framing:  I find this one fascinating:  There <i>is no world</i> outside of the three focus characters.  Yeah, we may describe people walking by, but the story is going to be about these three people, and they're going to get all the lines.  This format works much better than it sounds.  It is a staple of scripting for the stage from way back ... when extras can be variable (depending on what troupe is performing the piece) you don't want to depend on the extras for more than a flash of color and movement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how such a division would impact the kinds of stories that people can tell with their characters.  Is a character played by someone who has Chorus abilities inherently geared for a different set of possible stories than one played by someone who has Scene Framing abilities?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84198/#Comment_84198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T23:44:54+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 11:44PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very interesting. I'm playing around with something kind of similar for Suicide Beast and Ghost Bike Club, but I hadn't drawn the distinctions as clearly as you have here, and I made the  assumption that the game must have one of each. <br><br>I think it's completely possible to tell the same story with a Chorus character that you could with a Scene-framing character. But the focus would be very, very different. Same series of events, same outcome, completely different point of view. <br><br>I think.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84202/#Comment_84202" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T02:26:21+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  2:26AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 2:28AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The 2 Chorus, 1 Scene-Framing model is exactly what I'm doing with my game, The <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18492.msg195022" rel="nofollow">Lucky</a> <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20855.0;prev_next=next" rel="nofollow">Joneses</a>. So far it's worked brilliantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy 'brilliantly' I mean that everyone who's given the 'Chorus' card feels completely liberated to introduce characters into the scene, and in the 7 playtests with about 30 players I've had, all the NPCs that have been introduced have felt completely natural to the scene and didn't overstay their welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
