                    New Month, new thread, though a bit late ^^;<br/><br/>I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/10/22/crowdfunding-collection-86/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 86, including every tabletop project started between 09/25 till 10/22.</a></b><br/><br/>As I had to take a health related a total of 114 new projects related to tabletop rpg got started, about 26 of those are new games. Because of the sheer amount I will keep the teaser text to those projects I actually backed or very much consider backing. Which means that you’ll find a lot of big projects within the list, that I haven’t mentioned.<br/><br/>Thus my favorite project so far is <b>Orun</b>. The RPG produced by New Agenda Publishing offers an afro-centric SciFy setting which I do find very fascinating and unique. The system seems okay and I am intrigued by their proposal for character creation. Thus I gladly pledged to it and do highly recommend to check it out.<br/>I did as well back <b>D.O.U.S – Dice of Unusual Size</b> to complete my set of cool looking translucent teal dice with strange sides. I was very happy with the previous kickstarter, having my dice and with the communication with the project creator, and do recommend this one. I did as well get close to back the <b>Pride Flag</b> dice.<br/>In regards of the German projects I would like to give a small shout out for the new edition of <b>Spherechild</b> and for the <b>Frosty Pen&amp;Paper Online</b> Patreon.<br/><br/>There are literally over a hundred more projects, which I invite you to check out:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Universal-Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Urban Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Sci-Fi Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Superhero Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Rules-Light Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Role-Playing Games Hybrids<br/>4 Gamebooks<br/>3 Settings<br/>5 Supplements &amp; Toolkits<br/>6 D&amp;D 5E Supplements<br/>4 Adventures<br/>6 D&amp;D 5E Adventures<br/>6 Dice Projects<br/>5 Coin Projects<br/>2 Dice Tower<br/>5 Dice Accessoires<br/>2 Card Decks<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>2 Secondary Literature (Books, Docus)<br/>2 Magazines<br/>6 Maps &amp; Tiles<br/>8 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Various Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Podcast<br/>1 Gamecafe<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Supplements<br/>1 Dice Project<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Dice Tower<br/>1 Comic<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfunding</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/>Link: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/10/22/crowdfunding-collection-86/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/10/22/crowdfunding-collection-86/</a> </div>
