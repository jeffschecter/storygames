Choose one that seems appropriate, according to the nature of the Threat.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weird</span></b><br/><br/><b>Psy Burst: </b>The hero must exhaust a bonus die <i>ability</i> of their choice, if available.<br/><br/><b>Spectral Drain: </b>Remove a power token from a hero that has two or more.<br/><br/><b>I'll Be Back!:</b> The threat is getting away!  Introduce a normal movement threat with a countdown of 1 that must be overcome or the threat that made the move escapes!<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Science</span></b><br/><br/><b>Disruptor:</b> The hero must exhaust a bonus die <i>gear</i> of their choice, if available.<br/><br/><b>Stasis Beam:</b> cripple a vehicle rendering it useless until repaired by a appropriate trait test.<br/><i>(define more precisely what a crippled vehicle can or cannot do elsewhere?) </i><br/><br/><b>Against the Clock!: </b>Add a countdown 2 to an existing threat that has no countdown.<br/><br/><b>Science!:</b> Add Resistance 1 to an existing Threat.  <i>\u201cI knew you were coming and prepared my minions accordingly, Dr. Nemo!\u201d</i><br/><br/>Names are all quick brainstorms.  I probably wouldn't do threat \u201cnatures\u201d either.  Just spit-balling.<br/><br/>I'm not certain what the Threat move level of any one of these should be.  You'd have to think carefully about the economic of the turn and power resource represented by them.  One established baseline I see is that a power token can generically completely mitigate a Reduced Hit (Danger 2 move).  As the game stands a player's turn is perhaps the highest resource unit.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just a lack of mental acuity but I start to lose some creativity in describing Reduced Hits over the course of an action scene so I see the Danger Move 2 as most needing some variability. <br/><br/>Spectral Drain is probably perfect at 2.  Given that a power token can completely mitigate a reduced hit, it's simply a reduced hit by another name that the hero <i>must</i> mitigate. <br/><br/>My sense is that most non-standard Threats moves should be 2 with a few possibly being 3. Danger 1 escalations, \u201craise the stakes or make the situation worse in some way\u201d are golden.  Even if I can think of and price an alternative move at 1, I'd still want to choose the escalation move most of the time.<br/><br/>I'll Be Back is simply a narrow version of the existing Danger 3 Threat Move and could be priced at either 2 or 3. <br/><br/>Some or all of these might possibly seem dickish/anti-fun.  But I priced at 2 or 3 they'll often be a kindness compared to the alternative.  They'll <i>seem </i> mean, making the players really gun for the threat that did it to them.  They'd be another dial for the GM.  Hero too injured?  Take a little of their \u201cstuff\u201d instead of hitting them.<br/><br/>Other possible threat moves might temporarily reduce 1 specific trait die outside of the Injured condition economy.  A Mind Control move that forces the hero to fight against his foes (as an extra turn outside his normal turn so he wouldn't lose his own turn! \u2013 he'd be fighting the influence) is another thought.  Probably a Danger 5 move...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269758/#Comment_269758" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T18:22:10+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  6:22PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes.

A sort of escalation of <i>potential</i> danger/harm  rather than an immediate thing evident in <i>visible</i> changed circumstances as with the current Danger 1 move.  Might be a Danger 2 move - not sure.<br/><br/>You might even describe this move as something where the camera/narrator shows us something the hero doesn't know about but which could make his life much more interesting, a trap or the like.  And then the player or GM can incorporate it later if they like.  It'd be a Vincent-esque thing where a Move is also a GM technique like foreshadowing or breaking the fourth wall.  And in the Pulp wheelhouse, I think.<br/><br/>Elite moves might be more about providing unusual options for the GM to flavor a Threat rather than being truly "elite"/scary.  You could err on making them over-priced options if they're not in the Standard moves where you'll probably want to get it <i>juuuust right</i>.<br/><br/>I want to see Brendan's Threat moves.

It occurs to me that this is where the bread and butter is of GMing Danger Patrol. I mean, I KNEW that already but this brings it home. If your players are bringing their A-game and really describing crazy stuff and trying wild stunts and introducing a lot of threads for you to take advantage of, then this is how you reciprocate. Not with "the laser hits you for a reduced hit" but with "you blow four gaping holes in Dr. Maddscienz's 50ft tall robot including one through the clear dome on its head with crackling energy inside. That crackling energy arcs out through the holes you made, hitting you (take a reduced hit, man) and striking several of his minions who suddenly mutate into giant, purple brutes with rippling muscles and rows of fang-like teeth."<br/><br/>Forgive the comparison, but prepping for Danger Patrol is a little bit like a rap battle. You want to have some ideas in advance and maybe a few lines pre-written just in case you're caught flat footed but mostly you're doing that bit of pre-writing to get your mind right, to get in the right mental frame to spit the other 98% of your verses freestyle and with the same hope of getting "oh snaps" and "hell yeahs" from your audience (that is, players). Elite threats moves and maybe a Hall of Fame of threat movements from APs would be great for getting the juices flowing even right before a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270340/#Comment_270340" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T07:33:12+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  7:33AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One I thought of the other day: place an obstacle in front of the character, or move the character on the map so that there's now an obstacle in the way.

Prepping for a rap battle is about right in terms of the mental agility you're about to exercise when playing DP.  My improv training persuades me not to have any lines pre-written.  Ever.  But I'm not in my 20s or 30s anymore, so maybe I should yield a little on that, at least for the teaser action scene.<br/><br/>For me personally I do pretty well with the Danger 1 Moves; my brain understands what's required of me for an "escalation."  I'm adding something to the fiction, cool dangerous things or changed circumstances.  I have to create *something* to justify placing that die on the Threat card.  What was it?  Think brain!  Think, damn you! <br/><br/>But on the Danger 2 reduced hit Move I just seem to slip to easily into, "The shape acolyte blasts you with his sphere crystal.  Take a reduced hit."  Thus, my "need" for alternate Moves.  But maybe just better mental prep, perhaps aided by more Move examples from the game text would go a long ways.  I *still* want cool/weird alternate Moves though.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Ironically, I'm hyper aware when I'm running 4E of how stale a simple reporting of hit point losses are and go out of my way to color those as vibrantly as I can.  It really is a lot about a mental approach.  I recall John's reduced hit Moves adding a lot to the fiction each time when he ran DP for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270347/#Comment_270347" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T08:26:10+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  8:26AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>One I thought of the other day: place an obstacle in front of the character, or move the character on the map so that there's now an obstacle in the way.

Those would work even better now than they did in DP Alpha because I could have them be only 1 or 2 hit Threats rather than the full 3, and I might allow the hero to have any leftover hits apply to the original threat she was moving towards to take out.  Hmmm, maybe "spillover" should be included in the general definition of movement threats, similar to how that works in FATE\u2026  They'd be like "threats with a built in weakness."<br/><br/>But yeah, Matt, maybe defined as a specific kind of Move and maybe movement threats only cost Danger 2 as you suggest, unless they have a countdown or something...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270410/#Comment_270410" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T23:23:50+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 11:23PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, Matthew, you've spent a lot more time thinking about these than I have!
