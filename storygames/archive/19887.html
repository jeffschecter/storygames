If things work out, it will go through it's first round of testing on Dec 6, and after that I will be opening it up so I can get a wider range of feedback.<br/><br/>Dream Palace is the Story Game of Hollywood Cinema. It is GM-less. The players take on the various jobs in a movie production in order to put together a Hollywood style story.<br/><br/>As stated above, there is no GM, but the jobs performed by a GM are split up between three of the players. They take on the Staff Positions of Writer, Director, and Producer.<br/><br/>Writer- Sets up the beginnings of the movie's Sequences and plays the parts of the Extras.<br/>Director- Keeps the story on track.<br/>Producer- Casts the actors and doles out Star Power.<br/><br/>One of the concepts in the game that I am both proud of and nervous about is the Story Track. Movies are meant to manipulate the emotions of the viewers. Scriptwriters will often use a "<a href="http://www.savethecat.com/category/beat-sheet" rel="nofollow">Beat Sheet</a>" to help them with that. It acts as a guide to what happens where in the story. I've adapted the Beat Sheet concept to Dream Palace. As the story progresses, a marker advances along the track and the space it lands on tells the players what is expected in this part of the movie and any changes to the rules.<br/><br/>The narrative of the game is controlled by playing cards. Players can take the Spotlight by playing a card from their hand that is higher than the card played previously.<br/><br/>I'll keep everyone updated on how the playtest progresses. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reply.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
