We had from 18 to 38 people playing and running per slot.  Everyone involved really threw themselves into it and were great.  This thread is to go over successes and any areas you think might be improved.  I'd also like to open it up to brainstorm ideas for next year.<br/><br/>What was great (just off the top of my head)\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of games and lots of GMs that spent time there showing off games<br/></li>\n<li>Some people just spent a lot of time there making it a fun place to drop by and hang out<br/></li>\n<li>Lots of new players introduced to games and hopefully interested in playing them more<br/></li>\n<li>People came from the exhibitor's hall to play games they had found<br/></li>\n</ul>\nThings that could have been improved (again just a quick list )\n<ul>\n<li>There were a few times when we had a group of players but no GM to run something.  Most of them found something else, but in a couple of insistence I think they came from a recommendation from an exhibitor so I felt bad we couldn't make that immediate connection.<br/></li>\n<li>Location stuck out at the edge of events made it tough to get to and coordinate with the booth staff.  Given that we were running things full time while the exhibit hall was open meant we couldn't just drop by and communicate.<br/></li>\n<li>We have no way of knowing how well we are getting anyone to get back to the booths and the booths don't know how well we get to play their games.<br/></li>\n</ul>\nSome specific feedback, discussions, etc I'd like to see.<br/><br/>For those who were there, did you enjoy it?  What did you see that may be worked on for next year?  Is anyone interested in some kind of contact list so that if people show up looking for a particular game and no one's there to run it, we could find out if you are available.  <br/><br/>Would the companies, designers, etc, want to be able to send their volunteer GMs with people to run stuff at a central location?  The other people at Games on Demand are a higher concentration of your customers so getting it out there for enthusiastic play I think tweaks peoples interest.  Also, you may send a GM and a few of players over there and find more interest, filling up your games.<br/><br/>Would you be interested in having a table for a certain slot were you could have people sign up at the booth and know they could play the game then?  Is there interest in a sign-up book to commit to a game in a particular slot (say a bunch of people a looking for Mouse Guard, and you could play it tomorrow, put a sign up sheet in the book and come back and run it then).<br/><br/>Is there any reward you would be interested in give a player in one of your games to get them to show up at your booth?  To convert interest into a sale (and a potential new enthusiastic community member).  I know that margins are tight but something might help, even a button, other swag, a drawing for something, etc.  <br/><br/>Were the postcard sized adverts useful, helpful, did people show an interest?  Did you get any feedback from people saying their impressions of what we did (positive or negative)?<br/><br/>Any other thoughts for this year (or next) are welcome.  I certainly had a great time so I'm certainly interested in continuing to help.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225018/#Comment_225018" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T07:11:12+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  7:11AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a great time at Games on Demand this year! I think it was a huge success. Also, we seemed to have more GMs running indie games there than in previous years. I agree more GMs will help next year, though. A couple people expressed to me a desire to help out as a GM at GoD next year, too.<br/><br/>We did manage to drive people down to the exhibitor's hall to purchase games. I know that Design Matters (especially Nathan) thanked me personally for generating so much traffic for them. Nathan sold out of Annalise. If IPR had been selling My Life with Master, they'd have sold a number of copies. I had at least 8 different people ask me if I knew if anyone was selling MLwM at GenCon -- I suspect because Tony and I each ran a session of it at GoD and I ran another session of it at Embassy Suites.<br/><br/>I know from discussions that people were seeing the postcards and that boothies were sending folks up our way. That part worked great.<br/><br/>I think staggering our four-hour slots against the normal slots (most GenCon slots start at 8 AM; ours start at 10 AM) meant that people who didn't have events in the morning could check out the dealer's hall and then mosey up to GoD for fun later on. It may have increased traffic to our booth. On the other hand, if people had an event at noon, they didn't want to jump into a 10 AM - 2 PM event. It might be mixed bag, but it seemed to work.<br/><br/>My only suggestion for next year is to change the duration of the "host" role. As it was, one person was on point for four hours and they needed to avoid running games unless they could also watch the display table. Four hours of doing nothing is a killer. Also, because GoD ran from 10-6 -- same as the dealer hall hours -- it meant that fully committing to GoD meant missing the dealer's hall entirely. I recommend we set up two-hour host slots against the four-hour game slots so that you can watch the table and greet people for two hours, then go eat and check out the hall for the other two hours, and then return to run games later. <br/><br/>Another thing that was wildly successful for me was the two-hour demo slot. I ran a two-hour demo of Carry for five players and they loved it. I also ran three extended demos in another two-hour slot (40 minutes each of Annalise, Carry, and Misspent Youth). The players really enjoyed this. I think the booths should do something like this at GoD. Perhaps we have a Games on Demand Demos slot (Saturday 10-2 or something, or even just 10-12) where a few boothies come up and run 40-minute demos of several games. I suspect people would line up for miles for that.<br/><br/>Pretty much everyone who showed up at Games on Demand later on showed up at the various indie booths, or they had been to the indie booths before coming up, as far as I can tell from discussions with them. I personally stopped down at the booths on Thursday and let a number of boothies know that a couple GoD tables were free for them to run games from 10-6, and I think a few people took advantage of that. I also was very open about inviting those same people to Embassy Suites for informal, ticketless gaming in the evening. Saturday night, my Carry group came back and Arnold graciously ran a game of The Mountain Witch for us all.<br/><br/>The idea of sign-ups seems to go against the spirit of Games on Demand, really. I'm not saying don't do it, but it does mean that the GMs we have available will be committed to games well in advance of players showing up to "demand" games. Part of the coolness of what we do is being available when the players show up and magically giving them a game right then and there. <br/><br/>I would have liked to have had a better communication channel with designers of popular games. For example, if we'd have had a line to the Burning Wheel / Mouse Guard folks, perhaps we could have gotten them to send a GM up. They were all really busy running demos and selling product at the booth though, so maybe not. &lt;=) Still, it'd have been good for us to work with them on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225037/#Comment_225037" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T08:07:28+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  8:07AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved the 2 hour slots.
