Basically I'm 99% sure that every decision is made out of character, with post decision justifications if i ask him why his character would do what he did.  How do i get him to roleplay better? <br/><br/>I was thinking of asking him to fill out character questionaires to ask makethink about who his character is and to build a kind of fictional perspective.  Does any one do this, does anyone have questions that they can post here?  And does anyone disagree with this format or agree with it but feel that i should do this differently?  Lastly does anyone have anything to add ?<br/><br/>Its an age old discussion, but I've never seen this problem so bad before....  his character could be a sociopath, but otherwise....                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437173/#Comment_437173" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T14:14:34+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  2:14PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a friend like this that never grew out of it. When pushed to role play and develop personalities, he just started making up character personalities that linked with sociopathic behavior to explain why his character made all decisions based upon "winning."<br/><br/>This guy just may not be into the whole character thing. One idea that COULD help is get him to identify fictional characters he likes and have him role play as one of them. Then you and he have a common ground to discuss how that character would think and behave.<br/><br/>My friend's favorite characters are all bad asses that do whatever they want and win all the time. So this approach didn't work for him. Favorite action hero? Blade. Favorite thinking character? Doctor house.

Maybe play a game that's more about the tactics than about the role-play. Just a session or two and see how he likes it. He might just have a different play preference than you. He might be all over D&amp;D 4E Encounters, for example. Really light on the RP, all about one hard-hitting combat encounter.<br/><br/>2. Or try a game where it's basically impossible not to role-play, like Fiasco. If you're not familiar with it, it's a one-shot game, produces awesome results pretty reliably, and basically has no character sheet or stats. It's all storytelling and role-playing.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437175/#Comment_437175" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T14:45:33+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  2:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whether you use Fiasco or not, be clear at redefining the "winning conditions" of the game you are playing. Right now the problem is that you both have different "winning conditions" in mind. It looks like for you it's achieving a shared aesthetic reaction with your group. and the rest of your players seem to have understand that. But for this player you mention, since his previous game experience with similar games comes from videogames, it seems his "winning condition" is wiping out the oponents. Since all the fun roleplaying related to that is being a badass, in his mind he's doing things the right way and probably doesn't understand what you mean at all.<br/><br/>Now, let's see, if you could write down a "winning condition" that could produce the kind of game you enjoy, what it would look like? For Fiasco, I'd tell my players that the winning condition is making a character performance that could win an Oscar. It must have scenes with drama, humor, bad plans, lack of self control, the character needs to look vulnerable at some points so the audience can feel it's believable, noone can be totally evil, nor good, nor perfect and it all should end up terribly bad for everyone. The player who does this better totally wins the game (even when rules doesn't state a clear winning in Fiasco)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437176/#Comment_437176" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T14:55:58+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  2:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2014 3:09PM by cupbearer11.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys thanks for the fiasco suggestion, but i was more specifically looking for suggestions about the game we're playing - d&amp;d.  <br/><br/>Further the winning conditions are not nescessarily set by the game, you can play an rpg 3 trillion different ways, if you're saying the answer is not to play that game, im not sure i can agree wit that.

Rather than putting this guy on the spot by asking questions you don't ask anyone else, make it a regular part of your GMing that you <i>ask leading questions of everyone, all the time.</i>  Don't worry if it takes him a while.<br/><br/>Because...  Meanwhile you are building up NPC character relationships - which takes a little time - and some of them will be with him.  Some of them will lead to hard choices or emotional dilemmas, sacrifices, tests of loyalty, or emotional responses to his sociopathic actions.  Use these NPCs to <i>make him see the effects of his actions on realistic people</i>, not just on targets fit for killing.  Make what Vincent calls "PC-NPC-PC Triangles" (that's where an NPC treats two PC very differently and they have to come to some consensus on how to deal with that).  Or put him in a situation where if he does his typical thing, somebody he cares about (or has use for) will get hurt, upset, or lose faith in him.<br/><br/>In a similar way, <i>encourage your other players to speak to him in character.</i>  Set up some scenes for this to happen.  "Ok, I know Rayche and Blademan have different ideas on how to get the maguffin.  While everybody else goes out to get supplies, you two are left alone in the camp to discuss it.  Let's see that scene."<br/><br/>Finally, <i>let him "cast" his role.</i>  Pick an actor or character that he emulates, and then every time it's his turn, have him literally think of that actor in the movie scene: picture his look, picture his stance, and then deliver a line of dialog.  Even players who don't bond with their characters strongly can imagine little cool chunks of roleplay, like a single shot or one scene at a time.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437178/#Comment_437178" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T15:01:11+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  3:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">@DustinDePenning</a><br/>I think you're friend mightve chosen those people because his "winning condition" (to put it like Mr. Dray and WM) was to counter the GM...   <br/>In my case, my guy is new to roleplaying, no matter how much i stress what the purpose of the game is (in my opinion its to play a character, have fun etc..... nothing too extreme here) he seems to think that the rp part is window dressing.

I'm a semi trained actor and have fun with roleplaying, but the rest of the group is not and i don't expect them to suddenly be super amazing rp'ers just because i enjoy it so much.  The existing players are experienced though, and though i wish they were better roleplayers, i am accepting of what they can do, and measure each person by their personal capabilities not some bar that i set as a standard.  In other words, this is not a drama class, nor is it an immersive angst filled explorative characters study.  Were talking basic roleplaying.

He is a cryptic person in real life and difficult to discern in general.  I feel that he views the world through a set of filters that are far different from what i am used to or have come to understand.  He responds to my attempts without resistance, but it fails to have any real effect on him<br/><br/>Example:<br/>The characters need to use the brain of one of these two brothers (npcs) to restore a creature that will tell them how to get inside a particular area in the game.  The first brother is funny, cute and innocent about the world, his brother is calculating and evil.  The players all (inclusive of the new guy) were in stitches after they met the cute brother, they were all smiles (the players i mean) and they're reactions to him were positive.  As soon as the discover they need to get a brain, the players start to devise how they can ambush the bad brother, whereas my new guy says, 'why not just kill him?" 'him' being the cute funny brother.   <br/><br/>Now, i know someone will post that this is a valid option.  Sure... I agree, but the new guy isn't evil in alignment (and for the record while he's figuring himself out I've allowed for him to change his alignment on the fly) and he has no history of acting that way.  The whole group was taken aback by this and it was creepy, but not an intentional creepiness.... point in fact, the callous bad ass mercenery killer character in the group didn't want to kill the little cute brother!  It was just super sociopathic, his answer wasn't that he was, or that he hated the brother or that he was immune to cuteness, but rather that it was less risky than going after the smarter more evil brother.  <br/> Now, I'm all for the hard/brutal decision type play style that you see in a lot of rpgs.  I mean, as a last resort becuase they can't kill the other guy maybe the pc's have to kill the nice guy, but it was the first thing he said and he basically did it as though it mattered not.... almost as if this guy wasn't real, as though he was (gasp) a pixelated character walking around in GTA. <br/><br/>I know this is strange, but i had the feeling afterward that although he was laughing and enjoying this NPC, he was really just laughing at my performance, that he wasn't really picturing this character at all, didn't have a connection, didn't really 'buy in'.  The character was well established before the brain thing came to light and the sudden and ruthless decision to suggest that we kill him provoked some excellent roleplaying in the rest of the group as they stared at him with shock and horror like he was about to eat a live puppy.<br/><br/>My friend (also a player) who studied education says that my new player may not be able to actually see the game in his head.  Supposedly a small percentage of people can't visualize things in their mind.  In my non proffessional opinion i find this hard to believe personally, but i wonder if this could be why.<br/><br/>Assuming that he can visualize, why doesn't he?  Why is there no buy in?  And to be clear, this story is not an isolated case; just a very good example of what i am talking about.                            </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437191/#Comment_437191" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T17:18:53+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  5:18PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Ask leading questions, all the time" is great advice!

You take it as well. Chances are he's way down the Tactician or Power Gamer lines while you're farther along the Method Actor or Storyteller. There's nothing wrong with any of that, per se, but if your expectations are for less Tact/Power Gamer and more for MA/Storyteller than what this player is, then you're not going to solve the issue by trying to win him over.<br/><br/>I've dealt with similar issues with players at my tables before, both as a GM and fellow player. Sure, this player might be brought around, but most likely not. I've run experiments with simple in-game stuff to coax more role-playing out of my largely Tact/PG groups before, and they've fallen flat. Certain players expect certain things out of certain games. Like rewarding in-game details with bonuses, something like Exalted where a better description would get a minor bonus. After a few rounds of attempts, someone did the math and told me that the extra time spent describing the action would be better spent just pushing through as over the long term more attacks per hour was better than a 5% bonus chance to-hit. No, I'm not kidding. Similar with action points, fate points, meta-currency style incentives. That one seemed to stick, but the one player who it was implemented for simply stock-piled the things and had to be reminded to use them.<br/><br/>You're free to do what you think is best for your table, of course, but if their play style is enough of an issue for you to post about it here, you should definitely talk to the player about it. And for what it's worth, I don't think it's fair to that player that you would try to push them toward the style of play you want from them. Unless this gamer is quite new to the hobby, chances are they already know what they like and don't like. If it's a huge problem, they don't fit with your table. If it's not a huge problem, you probably wouldn't have posted about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437199/#Comment_437199" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T19:34:23+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  7:34PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the game level, part of the problem is you're playing with a system that has no mechanical support for roleplaying.

A very nice guy and he does charity (teaches youth football overseas), not that these things eliminate the sociopathic possibility but like what liblarva was saying, roleplaying is not really a good indicator of this, seeing as what someone expresses in a fictional world is not nescessarily what they would do in real life.  Actually the dissonance is what is harming his rp ability in my opinion.  I think being able to exist outside of morality in a game is a liberating thing for him and also i should add he's a friend of mine for fifteen years, we play soccer together and i've been tryiing to coax him into roleplaying for all these years so i can attest at his "not-creepiness."<br/><br/>Now snej, when you say 'don't play d&amp;' im with you there, don't like the game, but this is a long term campaign and frankly i can't get the other people to play other games.  Plus again, I realize fate rewards you for being a person, but we aren't playing fate.  If you want me to complain about D&amp;d thats not a problem, i can spew forth piles of vitriol at the game, (were playing 2nd edition!) but its what i have to work with sadly.  To be honest though, i do reward roleplaying with experience.  The thing is that i only award small packets of xp for good rp because ultimately i don't believe Rping rewards should be a sledgehammer against the players.  If start heaping out points to the others then I suddenly become this judge of roleplaying--remember that he combats me with "I know my character better than you do" and in a way he is right isnt he?  I typically give out small rewards to extroardinary rp, but make good rp its own reward foremost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437202/#Comment_437202" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T20:33:39+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  8:33PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a><br/>what would be the point of the quiz?  to bring out things that appeal to him in the game?

The point isn't to "coax out the role-player in his soul", rather to cement in your mind that he's not interested. That your expectations and desires and what you get out of RPGs is simply different than what his expectations and desires and what he gets out of RPGs. It's to help you learn to accept him as he is and just have fun with it. Just as you'd cater to the player who loves puzzles, or the player who loves mystery by including those elements, just cater to his wants by more opportunities for him to play to his strengths, rather than force him to play how you think he should.\n<blockquote>i've been tryiing to coax him into roleplaying</blockquote>\nHuh. So you've already talked this guy into playing RPGs? Damn, leave well enough alone. That's a major victory in-and-of itself. Don't make his experiences with RPGs into a terrible one by you pushing him to play your way instead of his own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437204/#Comment_437204" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T21:01:35+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  9:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The good thing about 2E (not a phrase I often type) is that it's such a fucking mess of unrelated subsystems that you could easily hack in, say, FATE-style Aspects and Compels, or 5E's BIFTs (probably a better sell since 5E is actually D&amp;D and is quite close in design space to 2E) without breaking anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437207/#Comment_437207" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T21:28:15+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  9:28PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Liblarva says, basically.  It sounds like this guy is playing a game of D&amp;D that's perfectly in line with a playstyle that the game supports.  He's doing things you don't like--but he's not doing anything wrong.<br/><br/>The solution is to talk to your players.  Not just the new guy, but all of them.  And don't talk as the voice of authority--When your talking about play-styles and expectations, the Dungeon Master isn't in charge--they're just another player.<br/><br/>If you really believe there's a role-player inside this guy that just needs to be coaxed to the surface, you're not going to do it in D&amp;D.  Take the suggestion that you run a game like Fiasco more seriously.  Not as long term thing, but as a short break from your D&amp;D game.  You're the Dungeon Master, yeah?  Being the GM doesn't mean the same thing in all games, but in D&amp;D, it means you're in charge.  So if you say "alright, next week we're going to take a break from the halls of the Orc king to play this game called Fiasco instead", you're probably going to get a response of "alright, sure".  If you don't get that response, maybe question why you're GMing for that group at all.<br/><br/>But don't expect that to necessarily fix the problem.  Certain gamers see RPGs as an opportunity to stab Kobolds for their XP and treasure and see role-playing as window dressing.  Some of those gamers have that attitude because it's the attitude they've been trained to employ and they're unfamiliar with other play-styles.  But some of those gamers just like killing monsters and getting treasure and just don't care about XP.  Maybe that's not someone who belongs in your game--but it's not because they're broken and need fixing, it's because you just want different things out of the same game, and that's okay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437208/#Comment_437208" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T21:54:04+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  9:54PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2014 10:04PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you really believe there's a role-player inside this guy that just needs to be coaxed to the surface, you're not going to do it in D&amp;D.</blockquote>I'd say if it's <i>really</i> inside him then it doesn't really matter what system you use.  I mean, in general, you're not wrong about D&amp;D.  But just remember that back in the day when hardcore roleplayers first began dissing minmaxers in libraries and kitchens everywhere, that was <i>exactly</i> the system we used.  The roleplaying was done <i>on top</i> of the D&amp;D system, even though mechanically the two levels were entirely unrelated.  So it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">possible</span>.  It's really a question of the players involved.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">@cupbearer11</a> - It may take time, and it may not happen.  But I'm assuming by the tone of the OP that you do believe it's possible.  <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph%27s">@Jeph's</a> questions are great.  <br/><br/>Here's another thought: Even players who approach the game from a totally strategic perspective might be prompted into <i>strategizing in character.</i>  They may never actually "play a role" in an actorly way.  <a href="/forums/profile/Liblarva">@Liblarva</a> is right about that.

It's like trying to talk about horses with someone who really enjoys cars.<br/><br/>The only thing I can think of is trying to be a good example of how you want the players to play, and also dedicate one session to talk it through with the whole group what they enjoy about playing. Recap what you have played, let the players come prepared with which session they liked the best and why. Hear everybody out. In my last group, we did that, and I discovered that I was all about weaving stories together when the group were more about <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">immersive</span> character play. I had to accept that as a player so I sat there waiting for my moments to shine. When they wanted to immerse in their characters, often through playing <b>Fiasco</b>, I passed. I wanted to immerse in the fiction.<br/><br/>So talk it through, and then show it through play to let the player know that there is another way of enjoying roleplaying games. Perhaps he will change. I know I have changed over the years, but that's the thing: over the <i>years</i>.<br/><br/>I also think playing <b>D&amp;D</b>, which is similar to most hack 'n' slashy CRPGs isn't helping. It brings out certain expectations. I remember when I started out experimenting with different playstyles, I picked up a new roleplaying game and said to my players "This game is played like [this]", no matter if it was true or not. It's easier to bring in people by giving them expectations rather than changing their existing ones. Did I force a playstyle upon them?

I understand that the rest of the party did not agree; the point was that in agreement about tactics is not the only way to play - without falling into "pvp chaotic neutral asshole". <br/><br/>I didn't mean to suggest a strategy where one of the other players would have left because of such decisions - of course, all these considerations are left to the GM to make, who's the one that knows the players, and can see in real-time what's their reaction.<br/><br/>Let me throw another possible input, then I'll just sit and listen :-) <br/><br/>On one hand you have a reasonably functional party ("go kill the evil brother"); on the other a "chaotic neutral" (not asshole, 'cause he didn't kill the nice brother...).<br/><br/>We assume the party had a consistent reaction to the NPCs. While the other one, went into GTA-mode and wanted to take a short-cut. Probably a different way to play. Why doesn't he take such short-cuts in life? 'cause there are consequences, not just because he's a nice guy. <b>Consequences in-game</b> (not being kicked out of the group, but experiencing the difficulties of the fictional world) are what can teach him wisdom.<br/><br/>On the other hand: you cannot force him to feel emotions, for NPCs, which he doesn't feel. So I though it would be more correct to let his play-style express. If that clashes with everybody else expectations for the game... well, he's just not suited for that party. It would not be the end of the world, I hope.<br/><br/>The last thought: maybe he's not that good playing a PC that cares. maybe he needs to play the "chaotic neutral asshole"... and again we're back to a clash in expectations for the game, as a group. OK, now I'll just sit and watch and hopefully a lot of people will have better suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437230/#Comment_437230" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T06:38:20+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  6:38AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On one hand you have a reasonably functional party ("go kill the evil brother"); on the other a "chaotic neutral" (not asshole, 'cause he didn't kill the nice brother...).</blockquote>\nI didn't mean the guy already was one - it looks like he does talk to other people and doesn't go behind their back to do things they strongly object to.

Providing in-game consequences in order to teach a lesson is what I meant by playing a suffering parent and/or a jailor. Whether this is "we kick you out of the party because we don't trust you anymore" (consequences provided by players) or "the town launches an investigation to see who murdered the nice brother because he was well-liked" (consequences provided by the GM). It can also make the game, and other people's fun, revolve around actions of one particular player.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it can't work. I was just cautioning to think about the whole group before implementing the solution, because some players (like myself) would not enjoy a game taking a turn like that.<br/><br/>(In general, I prefer when people sit down and talk about what they enjoy and what they get out of a game, which has also been mentioned as a solution.

Well, for a moment in your AP I thought he was a genius! \n<blockquote><br/>Example:<br/>The characters need to use the brain of one of these two brothers (npcs) to restore a creature that will tell them how to get inside a particular area in the game. <br/></blockquote>\nWell, at this point I thought, ok, put a brain with a personality inside this creature and you'll get what you want and possibly benefit the "donor" if this creature turned out to be stronger/better, etc.\n<blockquote><br/>The first brother is funny, cute and innocent about the world, his brother is calculating and evil.  The players all (inclusive of the new guy) were in stitches after they met the cute brother, they were all smiles (the players i mean) and they're reactions to him were positive.  As soon as the discover they need to get a brain, the players start to devise how they can ambush the bad brother, whereas my new guy says, 'why not just kill him?" 'him' being the cute funny brother.   <br/></blockquote>\nAnd this is why I think this was a good option. He's the good brother, I'd like him to survive and he could have better options by being on the body of the other creature. On top of that, if we got the evil brother inside said creature, what could guarantee our safety? And how could we be sure that the evil brother wouldn't at least try to deceive us instead of giving us the information? And all this isn't exactly incongruent with having a good alignment. But then again, I'm saying this taking two (most probably) misconceptions in mind: That the "donor" will be ok either way and that the creature is better/stronger than the "donor"<br/><br/>Ok, maybe I'm a bit of a sociopath too. Yet I understand that if this is the case with you friend, then it shouldn't be a bad thing. There are actually more functional sociopaths than you think.<br/><br/>But ok, this isn't a matter of what your friend would enjoy more (it seems he's already happy with things as they are), this is a matter of you not enjoying completely the game because your friend is ruining your fun. It's ok, try first to tell him what it your game's winning condition: Roleplaying in character as if the world was real, NPCs were real people with feelings and consequences of any action done or words spoken could really affect you or other people. Remember to tell him that this is about you; which is ok, the GM isn't a machine nor a showman, he's a player too and he has the right to have fun too. Otherwise, why would he GM? It's a load of work for which most of time no-one's grateful for. If he's your friend, he will understand. If he's just a sociopath, well, it's been nice to meet you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437293/#Comment_437293" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T14:04:06+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  2:04PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 2:16PM by cupbearer11.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay:  <a href="/forums/profile/Warriormonk">@Warriormonk</a> - You didn't understand the example with the brothers.  its the brain material, not the consciousness that is imparted (in this fictional case lol).  Therefore the donor is dead.  not stronger or whatever.  I didn't say he was a sociopath just that his character was acting like one. somebody else posted that my friend was  sociopath.  I can assure you that i do not think this, my friend is a great guy. (in real life) <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/everybody">@everybody</a> I think he is too new to have a fully developed play style at this point.  Further this isn't about him ruining my fun at all.  If he said 'im a psycho killer' then woopie, go and chop up the cute brother and harvest his brain.  The problem is that he is not engaging with the fiction.  He is not really roleplaying.  Again, people ask 'what is roleplaying', well there are different levels of it for certain people.  I can attest that roleplaying falls pretty low on the list for most of my players and that is okay with me becuase they are having fun.  but i can't really agree that this is a matter of playstyle.  If you do not roleplay AT ALL in a rpg that is not really a playstyle is it?  Its only half playing.  <br/>Further, I didn't stop him from chopping the cute brother up, the others did, because, like me, they thought it was absurd to do this, both in and out of game.  Again, you're going to have to trust me on this, as i was there, the sudden change of tone and motive was simply because he saw that this object fits into that object.... there was no consideration of anything else.  <br/><br/>Also, maybe its not worth dwelling on this example too much.  its not isolated case, if it was i wouldn't be posting here about it. Its the broader lack of roleplaying that i am trying to deal with.  Again, i am not asking for an in depth character study for gosh sake.  I think that if the example was that now it was his mother he was dealing with and not the cute brother he would have been the first to suggest slaughtering her too.  I would normally chock this up to mockery, but he was dead serious!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437294/#Comment_437294" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T14:13:10+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  2:13PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a><br/>Read robin d. laws (was meaning to anyway, you just finally sealed the deal), no questionairre that i could find, but the playstyle archetypes are interesting.

It's important for you to understand that his play style is completely valid. I sense a bit of judgment in "How do i get him to roleplay better?" He's not role-playing at all, right? <br/><br/>The easiest way to get people to do things is to ask them to do it. You say you've done that. To me, that's like me saying, "Hey, if you're gonna play Monopoly with us, you have to organize your money so your turn doesn't take too long," and the dude won't stack his money. <br/><br/>Barring that, reward the behavior you want. D&amp;D 2nd Edition doesn't really do that, if I remember correctly. I haven't played 2e since 1990. There might be XP rewards for role-playing, but they're largely overshadowed by XP rewards for killing things. Stop giving people XP for killing things--or reduce it significantly--and increase the XP for role-playing. D&amp;D 5e / Next has very simple non-XP rewards for role-playing in the form of "BIFTs" (bonds, ideals, flaws, and traits). You role-play your BIFTs, you gain Inspiration (you can only have it once; spend it, lose it, gain it again). You spend Inspiration, you gain Advantage on a die roll. Solid mechanical reward for role-playing. Even without a wholesale switch to 5e, you could implement a simple Inspiration mechanic with a solid +4 to hit rolls, saves, and whatever else for Advantage.<br/><br/>Punish behavior you don't want. I mean negative reinforcement in the psychological sense. I'd do it through the fiction, as others have suggested. If he is taking actions that fly in the face of what his character would do if he had a non-robotic personality, have NPCs point that out and inflict real consequences for that. The consequences can effect the entire party, too, which puts peer pressure on him. It's manipulative and not fun, probably, but this is someone whom you've asked to change their behavior and he refuses, right? <br/><br/>I'm getting a whiff of <a href="http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html" rel="nofollow">Geek Social Fallacies</a> here, too. You don't have to include this guy in your games if he doesn't play the way you play. You don't have to be all right with him playing the way he does. If he wants to play in this particular game badly enough, then he can conform to group social norms.<br/><br/>Really, by now, you should have talked to him to find out /why/ he's not role-playing. Maybe he just doesn't feel comfortable role-playing. Maybe he doesn't know how. Maybe he isn't interested. Maybe he finds it distracts him from what he feels is important about the game (winning challenges, perhaps). Really, I don't know how you can make any choices without knowing for sure. Talk to him about it.<br/><br/>Also consider the possibility that your game-mastering isn't inspiring him to role-play. As you said, "My other bud just sits there and retroactively justifies every decision." Is that two people who aren't really engaging with their characters? When the game is largely a set of combats linked together with thin thread, don't expect much more than the basic kind of role-playing. I know you're not saying you want Oscar-winning performances here, just basic character-driven decision-making. What are you doing as GM to evoke this from players.<br/><br/>A lot of character-driven stuff is put into motion at character creation. Was the character as created more than a collection of numbers and race/class choices? Did players show up with characters pre-made? Did they create them at the table together, but without any discussion about character concept between players? Or did they interact during character creation to create social connections among party members? What did you do as GM during this time to make sure they understood that character role-play was important? <br/><br/>What kind of hooks are you putting into play that require character role-playing solutions rather than "I hit it with my axe" solutions? Are there any social encounters that can't really be solved with combat? Have them stumble into a dragon's lair. If they fight, they will die. Make that really, really obvious up front. This is a role-playing encounter, not a combat encounter. And don't make the stakes "win or die." Make them, say, "win or lose all your gold" or something palatable. If they force a combat encounter, kill all of the characters and make new ones. Have them find an enemy that has crucial information they need. The enemy has 1 hp. If they even torture the dude in typical sociopathic tendencies, at least that's role-playing? (But I'd make it clear that any kind of torture will kill him, and that I'll change their alignments to Evil if they engage in torture, and thus no healing at the temple anymore.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437299/#Comment_437299" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T14:35:29+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  2:35PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/john">@john</a> Powell<br/>haha John, he replies to npc's like he is playing a choose your own adventure.

To clarify, there aren't two people not roleplaying you misread what i wrote.  there is just one person, and he is the one retroactively justifying his decision. Second you ask what am i dong to inspire roleplaying?  The answer:  not enough... .hence why i am posting on this thread.... so what do you suggest there Adam?<br/><br/>Regarding telling him there is a problem.  Well, its not a game destorying problem, and I have asked him but i have to polite, and of course if he can't understand what i am asking him to do, then there's no sense in punishing or kicking him out or getting upset.  Like i said, its not the end of the world.  That might need to go on a different geek list about taking games too seriously.  I think i'm somewhere in the middle here, although im obviously not good at communicating that.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have been getting a bunch of posts saying over and over that i shouldn't force him, while at the same time saying to kick him out lol!  The goal is to have fun.  he is not ruining the game, but i think the game is not clicking for him.  I can't stress enough how i am not pushy about this, i am trying indirect ways to help him 'blossom' (what other delicate non aggressive word can i use?)  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437301/#Comment_437301" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T14:46:52+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  2:46PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe do some one-on-one time with him.
