Play examples have been added in. The text has been edited for grammar (but note that this is Australian grammar, and I'm also sure there's going to be extra aspects that haven't been picked up).<br/><br/>Now that I've worked out a bit more about my PDF conversion software, the current release is a pdf compressed to "onscreen" resolution, so its size is drastically reduced from over 50Mb to about 5.5Mb.<br/><br/>Nothing's ever 100% perfect, but it's time to move on to new projects (unless demand calls me back to this one).<br/><br/>To those people who helped out, thanks. <br/><br/>The page for the download is <a href="http://vulpine.110mb.com/fubar.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
