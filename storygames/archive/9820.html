I have just arrived in the beautiful town of Northwich Spa, in the English Lake District, for my holiday.<br/><br/>Sadly, the entire population is dead. From my limited medical knowledge, they appear to have died earlier today from an unexpected viral outbreak. Since I have probably got the virus too, I have decided to stay here, rather than leaving and infecting the rest of the world. Also, the British Army have surrounded the town and are sending frequent messages that any survivors are under quarantine and forbidden to leave. Communications with the outside world are down, apart from this Internet connection.<br/><br/>I am hungry, thirsty and need to sleep. I also need to survive within this town for the next few hours or weeks (depending on whether I actually have the virus).<br/><br/>Could you tell me if there is anything I should be wary of? For example, the streets are littered with dead bodies. How soon does typhoid and cholera set in? How long can I survive without food and water, if I have to? Is there anywhere particular I should sleep, or can I choose anywhere? What should I be concentrating on immediately?<br/><br/>Many thanks for all your help. I'm determined to enjoy my holiday, no matter what!<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218342/#Comment_218342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T18:49:29+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  6:49PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How are you feeling?<br/>Are the pubs still open?<br/>This seems like something you Brits could simply wait out.<br/>Do you have any worries in particular, Graham?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218343/#Comment_218343" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T18:54:21+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  6:54PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you have on your person currently?<br/>Oh, I suggest writing a will, if you don't already have one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218345/#Comment_218345" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T18:59:05+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  6:59PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Graham!  <br/><br/>Do you have power?  I assume if the outbreak is localized you do.  If so, clear out the bodies, have a bonfire, and live it up.  There should be plenty of food around in the many local dwellings, as well as comfortable beds.  <br/><br/>You don't have much to worry about from the corpses.  Organisms traditionally associated with transmission from cadavers include bloodborne viruses (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human T-lymphotropic virus 1), enteric bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Escherichia coli, Leptospira), viruses (rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus and enteric adenovirus), parasites (Giardia, Cryptosporidium) and airborne agents (Mycobacterium tuberculosis).  So follow infectious disease protocol and burn them in a big pile.<br/><br/>I don't want to be a downer, but is there any chance that the British Army is going to ... sanitize ... the area?  If so, enjoying your holiday is the last thing you should be doing.  Escape is paramount.  They'll cut the utilities before they move in anyway, so the local situation will deteriorate rapidly.  Be gone before that happens, or die for the greater good.<br/><br/>A public health cordon, enforced by the military, is going to necessarily be porous.  There will probably be electronic monitors and FLIR-equipped aircraft, so minimize your heat signature and stick to wooded areas as you approach the likely line of defense.  If the British military is competent (an open question) they'll anticipate this and be watching waterways closely.  It may be necessary to kill - don't hesitate if it comes to that.  If you acquire a MOPP suit or similar protective gear, I'd suggest taking it and carefully hiding or destroying it - if they think you are "disguised", it will sow confusion and fear among your pursuers and slow them down.  In contrast, wearing a hazardous material suit will just slow you down and offer little protective cover.<br/><br/>What happens next depends on whether they are specifically looking for you, and if you are indeed infected, so there are too many variables to really pontificate at this point.<br/><br/>Have a nice holiday!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218386/#Comment_218386" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T03:17:20+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  3:17AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2009 3:17AM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan, the pubs are open all the time!

In my pockets, I have my wallet, my train ticket, my house keys, my club membership card, a tin of tobacco, some matches and my pipe. My luggage is behind the bar and has the normal travelling items.<br/><br/>Jason, I tried to leave last night, but could not. On the way, I heard two soldiers talking about how the cordon was protected by "GM fiat". I have no idea what that is, but it sounds nasty, so I'm staying here.<br/><br/>Currently, I am worrying about what to eat and drink. There also appears to be a party of drunk gentlemen roaming the town with shotguns, taking what they can get. If only I had my old service revolver!

Winds can also carry embers pretty far, which again, depending on how damp/dry everything is and what kind of surface they land on, you could have a lot of different fires starting up in different areas, and at the very least have structures smoldering and putting off large amounts of acrid smoke for days.<br/><br/>If you are in a large modern city, I would think the spread of fire would be less of a threat, though the collapse of buildings due to their structures weakening could have all sorts of effect, from clouds of debris to busted water lines to interruptions in power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218817/#Comment_218817" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:29:37+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:29PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>If this is the apocalypse, it is a jolly comfortable one.</blockquote>\nWhich is good and proper, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_catastrophe#Cosy_Catastrophe" rel="nofollow">given that you are in England</a>.<br/><br/>According to Wikipedia  The Great Chicago fire started from a single building and destroyed about 2 square of city in 2 days.

I have a feeling the fires won't be so much a threat as they are a barrier: They prevent you from accessing or traveling through that part of the town. <br/><br/>Then again, if the military believes the fires prevent you from leaving through that section of town, that area may be your only hope of escape...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219201/#Comment_219201" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T19:03:31+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  7:03PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it seems as if there are any soft spots in the ground, perhaps around a well or former site of a well,<br/>i would suggest you steer clear of them. perhaps they could give way, i've heard there are issues of that in <br/>that part of england.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
