Winter. 1963.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a year since the Cold War went hot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this was not just a nuclear war. Far more sinister, darker weapons were deployed from the shadows.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurvival and re-building are all that matter now. But human nature and tragic circumstances mean that everyone has their own ambitions.<br/>\n<br/>\n...a Government desperate to hold on to what remains of the country<br/>\n<br/>\n...military forces who wish to expand their power and influence<br/>\n<br/>\n...frightened and brutalised refugees who simply want a place to call home.<br/>\n<br/>\nInto this maelstrom steps the Special Situations Group, a motley band of men and women tasked with the jobs too dirty or dangerous for anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Hot War: a game of friends, enemies, secrets and consequences in the aftermath.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nHot War, is now available in PDF format from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16653" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=56797" rel="nofollow">Drive Through RPG</a>. Priced at $13, the PDF package contains both full and printer-friendly versions of the game. The hardcopy will be available at Indie Press Revolution from August 1st. However, between now and then you can <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16646" rel="nofollow">pre-order the book and get the PDF completely free</a>!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis alternative history/horror game for three or more participants has players dealing with life a year after the apocalypse. You'll confront hidden agendas, sinister factional machinations and see the changes in relations with friends and enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nHot War allows both short term and campaign play, with a system that allows the group to work out exactly the kind of game they want to play amongst the wreckage of 1960s London.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know more about the game, there is lots more information available on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/hotmain.html" rel="nofollow">Contested Ground Studios website</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you are planning on visiting Gen Con Indy 2008, Hot War, Cold City and many other fine games will be available at the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://playcollective.org" rel="nofollow">Play Collective</a> booth.

Setting dump is nice.. but system is what really matters.</blockquote>\nHell, sorry. I must have completely missed your question before. Apologies for not answering that. The system stuff on the forums is the second-to-last version, so it isn't quite what is in the book (but thanks to Steve for pointing it out).<br><br>What makes it neat? Hmm...<br><br>Well, characters are made up of attributes, traits, hidden agendas and relationships. I like the tension that can exist between the agendas and between the relationships, that's something that is cool for me. The places the secret motivations and the human relationships of the characters front and center. The hidden agendas are key elements of the character, but also key pacing elements for the game as a whole. Hang on, I'll explain that bit in more detail:<br><br>Hidden agendas are rated at 3, 5 or 9. This represents the number of conflicts you can use the agenda in before it reaches a resolution point, before the little story associated with that agenda reaches a conclusion. The higher the rating of the agenda, the less dice you get for each individual use. An agenda rated at 3 is powerful, but burns out quickly. And agenda rated at 9 is weaker, but lasts a lot longer. Once your agenda has been concluded (and the player has framed and played out a scene showing this resolution), you can pick another BUT, you can't pick the same rating you just had. So, in longer term play, this offers pacing and relative scree time for the agendas of the different characters.<br><br>That's one bit of the game I really like. It makes the pacing easy, almost seamless in play. Oh yeah, and hidden agendas can end in a good or bad way, depending on how many times they were used successfully in conflicts. So, you have one rated at 9 and have used it 9 times. That's a resolution scene. In all the conflicts that lead up to this, you used it successfully 5 times and unsuccessfully 4 times. So, the balance is on the positive side. Your agenda works out positively. However, the other participants in the game get to add 4 negative things that happen or come out of the resolution of the agenda. Conversely, if you had use the agenda successfully four times and unsuccessfully 5 times, the resolution would have a negative outcome. But, the other participants around the table would get to add 4 positive things that came out of it.<br><br>But, what do you look for in a game system? What is neat for you? If I know that, it will be so much easier to ascertain whether or not Hot War is something you would like. I think you'll find that with HW, the setting, system and design of the book strive to be as important as each other.<br><br>Cheers<br>Malcolm                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160029/#Comment_160029" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T05:58:46+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  5:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, there are links to Actual Plays on the Contested Ground website too, which give an idea into how it plays.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160252/#Comment_160252" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-01T10:57:24+00:00" title="August  1, 2008 10:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does hot war differ from cold city?
