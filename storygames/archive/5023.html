I basically wrote down everything I had and patched it together into a working game in about a month. <br/><br/>If I was going to make a short version now, I'd probably...<br/>* Trim it down to my favorite parts of the setting.<br/>* Clip out any fine-detail stuff from the rules - keep the gist of it and throw out the extra bits.<br/>* Pick a few really important pieces of technology to include.<br/>* Give about 2 pages worth of advice.<br/><br/>30 pages worked for the initial quickstart, and I think it could be done in that amount or less if I wanted to do it again. One advantage S.A. has is that character creation alone gives a good feel for what the setting is like. I know nothing about Defiance; perhaps if you gave us a general feel for the game we could point out what we think should or shouldn't be included.<br/><br/><i>edit: Oh hey, a thread about the game.

The few quickstarts I've really looked at are condensed to about 5-10 pages at most. They give abbreviated character creation, or none at all, sticking with pregens with maybe a few customizable color elements, like name and appearance. Organizations within the setting are described by 1 or two lines of text, to include countries. The most pared down elements of resolution are included, and usually an initial scenario, which tends to take up the majority of the document, next to character generation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be important to think about the fact that in our little corner of the industry, there are some full, successful games that aren't much more than 30 pages, and at least one game that's seen a lot of play that covers only a single page of text. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther discussions I've seen about quickstarts debate whether or not a quickstart should focus on introducing the rules, or the feeling. Sometimes the ability to jumpstart someone into the feeling of the game without all of the rules might require rules that differ significantly from what you're using for the full game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113206/#Comment_113206" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T23:05:44+00:00" title="December  9, 2007 11:05PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most interesting demo for any game I've seen: Tony LB's demo of Capes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had 4 characters made up. Two good guys, two bad guys.<br/>\nEach one was just a set of Index Cards, divided into Character Description, Goals, First Actions, Second Actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I picked the floating brain character. I had a couple of goals to choose form, and I chose Detonate The Necrobomb!<br/>\nEveryone else chose a goal. We then played our "First Move" (a couple to choose from). They all did a system-y thing, I think.<br/>\nThen we chose our "Second Move", which again did a different system-y thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was some dice splitting, some dice rolling, and a lot that was streamlined magnificently. To the point where we didn't need to learn about debt, powers, aspects, inspirations, or any of it. We just picked story options with small mechanics examples attached.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn't give us a sense of the mechanics, but it gave us a sense of the flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113260/#Comment_113260" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T07:59:49+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  7:59AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the answer will depend on what your demo version is <i>for</i>.

A short demo game using pregen characters seems to be the way to go. I shall get to work on it!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Marcus, could you tell us about Defiance? What makes it different from every other game out there? Because that's pretty much what I'd put in a demo.<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nI don't think there's anything unique about my game. I used to think it had some unique ideas until I realised that the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">assholes</span> I mean lovely game designers from here and the forge had those ideas before I did.<br/> <br/>However, here are some things about my game that I think make it special:<br/><br/>* Attributes, magic, skills, talents, resources, etc are all treated as colour to be used by players when they narrate the actions of their characters. E.g., no one has a strength +3 or the skill knitting 46%. <br/><br/>* In lieu of traditional attributes, characters have virtues. But these virtues don't inform the players how well the character is at performing certain tasks. Instead, they inform the players how much influence (experience) a player is rewarded for bringing those virtues to the forefront.<br/><br/>* In place of spending points or rolling dice, players resolve tasks for their characters by drawing coloured beads from a bag and basing the result on the combination drawn. <br/><br/>* The burden of assigning difficulties to tasks are distributed amongst all the players.<br/><br/>* Characters have leanings which act as a combination of class and disposition. E.g. being a renegade doesn't just mean a character is good at fighting, it reveals to the players how the character views and approaches most of life.<br/><br/>* Player's character can only die when a) the player wants it to happen or b) the succumb to their fate. This means there are no hitpoints or keeping track of wounds. Players decide when/if their characters get injured and they use those injuries as colour for their narrations.<br/><br/>* Every supernatural creature is a metaphor for some of the issues that might be faced by the characters. There are no creatures that have been put into the game because their cool, awesome, or tough! They're solely there to help focus the story on the issue at hand.<br/><br/><br/>P.S. I don't really think of anyone here or on the forge as an asshole. But I do wish they'd stop having ideas before I do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113352/#Comment_113352" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T12:31:32+00:00" title="December 10, 2007 12:31PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I'd pick a few of those and do a stripped-down version of the game to focus on those things.
