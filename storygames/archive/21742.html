(Via Aces &amp; Eights) <br/><br/>The counting up, different actions take different amount of time isn't the problem. Like Feng Shui or the board games Olympos and Patchwork and others. Our own <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> has some games that work similar. I can see the appeal.<br/><br/>The constant calling out "anyone on five?" is the problem. ??? Just use an initiative board, grab one from Patchwork, Snakes and Ladders or w/e!<br/><br/><br/>Stop turning the game into some sorta auction! "Going on three, three, can i get a three?" Esp since you're going second by second, it becames so painful<br/><br/>In general call out methods are annoying af to me. Savage Worlds suggests similar. Even on critical role (which I otherwise love) that's how DM sorts the initiative. When I did use initiative I used 30 numbered lines and the players would all state their rolls and i'd place the pc whose player rolled 14 on line 14.<br/><br/>Combining the two ideas, an initiative board can work with traditional initiative as well. everyone rolls &amp; then place their tokens.<br/><br/>Now, all of this is mostly a curiosity to me since i removed the initiative from my d&amp;d. But i have fond memories of feng shui where you needed initiative because that was a big - and interesting - part of how the various powers were balanced.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475551/#Comment_475551" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-20T08:59:08+00:00" title="July 20, 2018  8:59AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2018 8:59AM by Rickard.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I use a counting system but with an initative board because counting down is tedious (<b>Feng Shui, Deadlands</b>):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/matine_initiativbrade.jpg" title="For my game Matin\xe9"/> <img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/example_initiativeMatine.png" title="An example"/><br/><br/>I wanted to ditch combat rounds, and have an easy way to show number of opponents and who's turn it is.<br/><br/>The players place their tokens on the same number as their initiative and then move anti-clockwise 5 or 10 steps depending on what they want to do.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In my strategic game, all I care about is if the players are before or after the opponents. In all roleplaying game system, initiative is only important the first round (<b>D&amp;D</b>), or initiative is rerolled for every round (Feng Shui). I didn't want that.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/ThriceInitiativeBoard.gif"/><br/><br/>Instead, certain tricks (powers) are only useful if the character's are before the opponents, or they can gain temporary benefits from placing themselves after the opponents. In this case, the players control their own initiative from round to round.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475553/#Comment_475553" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-20T10:50:25+00:00" title="July 20, 2018 10:50AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about, the board.

Everybody tells that one player their initiative scores, and that player tells everybody whose turn it is next. The GM mostly needs to go "caller, whose turn is it?" on occasion.<br/><br/>I could see using a board, but that's less table space for something else, as a board needs to be big to be visible (and thus useful).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475589/#Comment_475589" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-21T18:05:28+00:00" title="July 21, 2018  6:05PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used a tiny li'l index card Eero!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
