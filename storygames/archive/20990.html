I recently completed my second playset for Fiasco, Splash!, set inside a pirate-themed waterpark. You can find it here:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_vB5heJzEGoj1T2NvwBGAYjcuyIVQcB6R_l6b33Tl0/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_vB5heJzEGoj1T2NvwBGAYjcuyIVQcB6R_l6b33Tl0/edit</a><br/><br/>Please feel free to give any feedback on it. If you or your group are interested in recording your actual play, that would be amazing. If you're an artist and have a piece that would be a good fit, that would be extra extra amazing!<br/><br/>I also would refer anyone interested to also check out the first playset I made, Black Neon. You can find it here:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1azMhx-WDGXi3vrBkbW49g8Mh0Mz-9W1Whay7al7x_t8/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1azMhx-WDGXi3vrBkbW49g8Mh0Mz-9W1Whay7al7x_t8/edit</a><br/><br/>Please feel free to give any feedback on it. If you or your group are interested in recording your actual play, that would be amazing.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
