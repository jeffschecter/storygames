There are almost no mechanical constraints.  There's no rules-oriented way to resolve conflicts - the conflicts are front-loaded and scenes don't end until they are resolved, so it is up to the players to sort it out.  It's rigidly constrained in terms of theme, scenes (and related conflicts, really questions that must be answered), and characters, but wide open in every other aspect.  Scene framing is completely loosey-goosey, scenes can occur in any order, players build their own relationship map, and outcomes are achieved by consensus.  There's no GM; it's got the lightest touch of system.  Given the default settings (a sort of fairy tale setting, a clash of love and honor), it played out like high fantasy.  A very satisfying and cohesive story emerged, involving a murdered infant, an heir to a curse of war and the sorceress who frustrates his blood-thirst, an enemy kingdom on the march and a princess with the power to stop it all.  It was pretty cool to see in action.  It reminded me of a storytelling exercise studded with gentle reminders to keep it on-task and awesome.  "Storytelling exercise" is often used as a shorthand perjorative for weak and systemless games (or parlor narration) but, you know, whatever.  I wasn't at all sure it would hang together, but it really does.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156354/#Comment_156354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-13T18:25:18+00:00" title="July 13, 2008  6:25PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a good time.

I love how very much a sorceress the sorceress was, without ever doing any actual magic outside of being very, very old.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that, if Dulse sees a good deal of play, you'll get an emergent "So what happened to the baby in your game?" phenomenon similar to the "and what happened to Regina Sutton this time?" effect.

So there were four players, and we agreed to use the default setting and ideals, fleshing things out a bit as we built the relationship map.  "The Killing" started out pretty straightforward - Calla and Arras were both gunning for each other, Arras gloated about fooling her (the whole game hinged on some prophecy that his son would lead the nation to eternal war, and Calla was an evil pacifist witch) by murdering his own heir.    She laughed at him and told him he was wrong, his plans had failed, and he was already dead - she'd poisoned his meal.  Arras, a tough dude to the last, tried to take his own life before her poison could fell him.  In the epilogue we discovered that he'd botched the job and died ignominiously after all.<br/><br/>In the end it was Arras and Dulse with 6 love and 4 honor, and (obviously) Baston and Calla with 6 honor and 4 love.  So everybody had pretty miserable outcomes.  I didn't stress the tactical nature of awarding love or honor, which might have made a difference.  We used playing cards (red = love, black = honor), and that was super simple.  Tokens, as I originally wrote, would be a little burdensome.  They would be a good option for a highly phsyical, LARP-y game, though.  It would support that mode just fine.  You could even structure it as a performance, I think - give the token power to the audience.<br/><br/>One thing I was pleased with was that the spread of love and honor mapped well to the fiction - Arras and Dulse <i>were </i>more kind-hearted and less honor driven.  The paired final spreads were a little anticlimactic, but it wasn't a huge deal.  Another thing I observed - the relationship map got used more heavily or more lightly, depending - Arras and Dulse shared "envy", and that didn't get much play.  Dulse and Calla shared "fear", and that was pretty central.  Again, I think that's just fine, as long as something interesting emerges for each character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156394/#Comment_156394" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T07:20:01+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  7:20AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad it worked well.

We learn that Arras is the father of the child.<br/><br/>Scene 2 - the betrayal - Calla and Dulse - Three months earlier, Dulse tells Calla that she refuses to have the child. Calla tells Dulse that it's too late for an abortion. Dulse abandons responsibility of the child and the child's future to the sorceress.<br/><br/>Scene 3 - the secret - Baston and Dulse - Shortly after the child's birth, Baston has waged war on a country across the sea and brought back a chest. The sorceress' prophecy involves some fate of war, if the child is given what is in the chest on his 18th birthday. Dulse tells Baston to take the chest back across the sea. Baston opens the chest and finds a gauntlet, then sails off and dumps it into the ocean.<br/><br/>Scene 4 - the murder - Arras and Calla - 16 years later. We learn Calla has been plotting something for 15 generations of Arras' forefathers which will culminate with the child. Arras reveals that he killed the child the day it was born and replaced it with another, who will be the legacy he leaves to the world. Calla counters that her prophecy relies on a child of heart, not of blood. Arras moves to run her through. She reveals that she has poisoned the grapes he has been eating. He stabs himself through the gut rather than die by her hand.<br/><br/>Scene 5 - the wedding - Everyone - The 18th birthday of the child, Duke Arras II. At this point, with Duke Arras I dead, the new duke became a player character. The boy has conquered a pirate who had been building an empire with a treasure dug up from the bottom of the sea, taken it for himself, and returned home triumphant to name his bride. Dulse, who has remarried to Baston, wants the boy to wed the sorceress, which will make him infertile and end Calla's machinations. Instead, he gives a speech to the people renouncing his father's hedonism, and takes a milk maid as his bride.<br/><br/>Epilogues: Arras II spreads war throughout the world and conquers many nations, but ends up dying old and fat like his father, exactly as Arras I wished him not to die. Baston leaves Dulse for a younger woman, and dies loveless. Calla, young and beautiful for 15 generations, finally withers to an old crone and dies. Dulse takes her place, plotting and whispering cold-hearted in the ears of rulers centuries down the line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156413/#Comment_156413" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T09:09:29+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  9:09AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The gauntlet was a fabled magic thing that allowed the wearer to enjoy endless victory, and the thing with Dulse taking calla's place in the epilogue = genius.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156571/#Comment_156571" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T20:38:53+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  8:38PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2008 8:39PM by Andy.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I really dug it, it was a cool exercise.  Me and Shane took a few seconds longer to "will ourselves" into character, mind you.  I needed a little more detail from the detail-givers in order to play the character more comfortably.  But I liked what happened. It wasn't like, "The Most Fun I Ever Had!!!(tm)", but this is the first time I've done a truly rules-free LARPish thing ("Jeepform", etc) since like 1995 or so. And I liked it.  It actually left me wanting more.<br/><br/>And Rafael getting right into it... to me, it kinda felt like a do-it-yourself semi-Shakespearean setup game. I kinda liked the story that developed, but even more I really liked getting into the character, and seeing what the other players did with their characters.  Even though we weren't all at each other's throats, there was definite palable drama (I really liked the scene with the Duke and the Captain talking about the third character). I'd totally play it again, or other games like it. It was a nifty acting exercise.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157092/#Comment_157092" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T02:11:54+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  2:11AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad that it went so well.

You're pretty much doing improv after the scene-setter calls the scene to begin. I didn't realize until later that I got pretty tired from the mind-racing, in-character stuff.<br/><br/>I feel kinda like I dicked with Rafael's duke, as the duke basically had a really cool moment as he revealed a plot, and then I (the sorceress), said "Yes, And..." where I basically came back and totally one-upped him, showing how his plan went as expected... AND YET he was still being manipulated by fate/doing what was expected of him, with no change in the results. Part of that was me, as a player, loved Rafael's portrayal of the disillusioned backstabby iron duke, and yet I didn't want that character to "win". So I may have retorted (?) too hard there, maybe. So intent on "good winning" that I basically invalidated (or validated, then totally countered) Raf's duke's narration.<br/><br/>Also, there was some group collaboration/exploration in the game as well, which made it work well I think. Namely, when the "Secret" came, there was thought of "Let's leave what the Secret is (the secret is the thing in the chest) undefined". But these days, I'm kinda tired of Pulp Fiction style cop-outs, so I jumped in (wasn't my scene) and said, "No, I want to see what this thing is! No vagueness, what's in the chest!"

Unlike the other verbs, they are more actions and less feelings. Does it mean that your character generally acts that way?

They also provide contrast to one another pretty nicely.  That was the theory, anyway - in the playtest my impression was that these were among the weaker, less-utilized relationship elements.  Deceive got some play, but frustrate, support, and envy got hit on lightly if at all.  That might be a fluke, or maybe they are not really appropriate or juicy.  <br/><br/>I thought the verb list would end up being the universal anchor, but now long term I'd like to refine the verb list and also create different "builds" for different sorts of games - a romance set, a blood and guts set, and so forth.  Imagine nine verbs that all focused on the nuance of love relationships.  That might be fun, and it'd certainly be a different sort of game.<br/><br/>Oh, and to answer your direct question - I think each group will find its own way, but I imagined pointing deceive at someone means you are actively lying to them and it should come out in play at some point.  Once it does, that relationship verb probably won't be hit again, which is fine.  Unless you frame a flashback or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157419/#Comment_157419" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T14:04:09+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  2:04PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.<br/><br/>Themed sets could be loads of fun ("Lusts after, Cares for, Fantasizes about, Despises, Is infatuated with...").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157433/#Comment_157433" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T14:53:52+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  2:53PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, add "thinks target is opposite gender" and you just made <i>As You Like It.  </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157450/#Comment_157450" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T18:12:58+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  6:12PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Jeph, the thing that pleased me most was watching the non-involved players watching the action like a hawk.

The thing about it that most excites me (aside from keeping people engaged) is that it crosses over the internal/external barrier to get inside people's heads.  Internal space has traditionally been sort of off limits, or at least, has been given a less than thorough examination (perhaps for reasons that have to do with theory...) I see Dulse, in terms of the internal/external dichotomy, on the player and character level, as sort of an opposite or counterpoint to IAWA.  I'm finding the comparison illuminating.<br/><br/>I'll be interested to see if this value judgment technology gets picked up in future games and becomes one of the design memes (e.g. relationship maps, stakes setting, etc.) that we see a lot of.  I'm all for it, and looking forward to seeing what derivatives people might come up with.<br/><br/>Haven't played it yet, but even just as a read, Dulse is a very informative meditation.  Thank you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157529/#Comment_157529" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-19T14:17:19+00:00" title="July 19, 2008  2:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Max.  I'm finding the dichotomy you outline becoming very important in my current projects.  I think it's natural when you view the character as a sort of liminal space between the player and the fiction to start to look more and more to the player's thoughts, feelings, and abilities without apology.  I hope you get a chance to try it and see if it works for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
