Here\u2019s one more post in my series.<br/><br/>Imagine for a moment that I put a blank sheet of paper and a pencil in front of you and tell you to write.  Imagine that I tell you to write a paragraph.  Imagine I tell you to write a paragraph about an apple.  Imagine that I tell you to write a paragraph describing an apple.  Imagine that I tell you to write a paragraph describing an apple that doesn\u2019t use the words red or green.<br/><br/>Now, notice that each time I add something I limit what you can write in some way.  Or if you don\u2019t see it as limiting, I\u2019m at least giving your writing some definitive shape or direction.  My main point of this post is to point out that these are as much rules as telling you to roll dice and subtract the total from your stat.  If you hand me a sonnet about a girl eating red cherries in the green trees you will have broken the rules.<br/><br/>Sorcerer has many, many rules of this nature besides its albeit powerful and central resolution mechanic and currency system.  Descriptors are perhaps the most obvious example.  Two things about descriptors is that they are chosen from a fixed list (not made up on the fly) and that the list be customized to give direction to the kinds of characters that are appropriate to any given vision of the game.<br/><br/>Consider, for example, the Will Descriptor from the book, \u201cBelief System.\u201d  For my Gothic Fantasy setting there is no \u201cBelief System\u201d on my Will Descriptor list.  In the source material, the late 18th Century Gothic Novel, Catholicism is a big deal.  So in my custom descriptor list there is \u201cFaith in The Church.\u201d  Also in the source material, nature vs. the will of man is a big deal.  So I also have, \u201cPaganism\u201d as a descriptor but it\u2019s not a Will descriptor, it\u2019s a LORE descriptor.  I will note that \u201cChurch Heresy\u201d is also on my Lore descriptor list.<br/><br/>I\u2019m willing to discuss why one is a Will descriptor and the other is a Lore descriptor, if you\u2019re curious, but I\u2019d prefer to do so in another thread.  But let me say that I have given it serious thought and it\u2019s intentional on my part.  It is by design.  It is a rule for my Gothic Fantasy incarnation of Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Another example of what I\u2019m talking about in Sorcerer is a Demon\u2019s Desire and Need.  These are not merely, \u201cguidelines\u201d for the Demon\u2019s \u201cpersonality.\u201d  Unlike descriptors, which are not character behavior limiting, Desire and Need are demon behavior limiting.   Like the paragraph describing the apple without using red or green, Desire and Need limit what a GM can have a Demon do.<br/><br/> The GM should not just wave off a Demon\u2019s Need simply because he feels it\u2019s not appropriate right now.  That\u2019s breaking the rules.  If the situation dictates the Demon goes into Need, it goes into Need period.  The GM should not have the Demon act counter to its Desire just because he feels like it.  There\u2019s a reason ordering a demon to do something counter to its Desire incurs a huge die penalty.<br/><br/>Now, I will grant that there is no objective timer for when a Demon goes into Need (although see the rules about Ability usage and Stamina).  Identifying the situational context for proper application of the Desire and Need rules is a skill that takes practice and requires cultivation.  However, I would like to assert that cultivating this skill is really no different than learning how to identify a conflict and reaching for the dice when one is spotted.  For what it\u2019s worth, applying Desire and Need appropriately is probably one of my weakest skills as a Sorcerer GM.<br/><br/>Everything I\u2019m describing applies in full to all of chapter four of the core book.  Chapter four gives people, including myself, a weird feeling the first time you read it because it appears out of place.  It comes between character/demon creation and the rest of the mechanical rules of the game.  This is because those of us familiar with other RPG texts are used to the material in chapter 4 being \u201csuggestions\u201d or \u201cadvice\u201d and thus at the END of the book.<br/><br/>Chapter four is not \u201cadvice\u201d it\u2019s more rules.   Chapter four provides the framework that gives everything in the follow chapters meaning.  Games of Sorcerer that don\u2019t work out can often be tracked back to a failure on the groups part to do something described in chapter four.<br/><br/>Example Complaint: Sorcery seemed ridiculously hard and not very useful.<br/>Likely Cause: Failure to define the Sorcery Technicality.  What\u2019s that?  It\u2019s in chapter four and basically comes down to defining the look and feel of sorcery as well as defining exactly what can be accomplished with Lore.  Without a Sorcery Technicality there is no context for earning bonus dice or roll over victories for rituals.  There is no direction for how demons move and behave.  Lore becomes a fairly useless and meaningless score.<br/><br/>Sorcerer, the game, is a much much broader thing than just its resolution system.  It is a very specific narrative structure and framework all of which is outlined in the core book.  Ron selected these narrative components very carefully by design.  They are not just color, suggestions, advice or guidelines.  They are rules.  The game will not work if you do not apply them correctly.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134429/#Comment_134429" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:15:51+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, what's in chapter four?

Chapter Four is one of those things I\u2019ve read nearly a dozen times and every time I notice something new and usually feel dumb for not noticing it the first time.  This time I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to myself and feel a little sadness too.  I feel like a guy whose been struggling to find something only to discover it\u2019s been in my back pocket the whole time.<br/><br/>The title of Chapter Four is quite plainly: Playing Sorcerer<br/><br/>The first section of chapter four is called Customization.  I think on my very first read through back so long ago I assumed that meant, \u201cOptions.\u201d  This is why I was originally confused by the placement of this chapter.  Why are we discussing options when we haven\u2019t finished discussing how to play the game as is?  Sigh.  Note the title of the chapter.  Note the first sentence under Customization: \u201cThe Sorcerer rules *require* some fleshing out\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>The four sub-sections under Customization are Humanity, Sorcerers, Demons and Tone.  These are basically the four ingredients of what is now commonly referred to among Sorcerer players as a \u201cone-sheet.\u201d  It\u2019s a refinement of those four elements so that everyone is on the same page regarding what kind of Sorcerer story is being created.  I would like to note in my previous post I mentioned the Sorcerous Technicality.  I misremembered what section of the book I was talking about.  The Look &amp; Feel concept I was discussing is actually here under Demons.  The Sorcerous Technicality is something else.<br/><br/>The second section of chapter four is called Organizing A Game.  The first three sections are largely concerned with how to prep a Sorcerer scenario.  The last section is primarily concerned with how to hook in the player characters.  I think what is most confusing about this section is that it talks about player involvement which goes counter to the traditional mold of the GM preps a scenario totally in secret and then \u201cruns\u201d the players through it.  However, it does not discuss HOW the players should be involved in each of these steps which is okay because that is highly individualized to the group and the context of play.  The book just says the players MAY be involved with each of these steps.<br/><br/>The first two sub-sections combine rather naturally to anyone with a background in horror role-playing, such as my experiences with Chill.  They are The Sorcerous Technicality and The Back Story.  Together those two sections basically say, \u201cLook at the possible consequences of sorcery (The Sorcerous Technicality) and hook that into a recognizably human conflict (The Back Story).\u201d  Which as I say dove tails nicely with my Chill background.  \u201cOooooooooo.  The spurned lover ghost killing young couples (The Technicality).  I wonder who spurned her and how she died? (The Back Story)\u201d<br/><br/>The third sub-section is probably the most confusing and Ron has admitted it\u2019s the section he\u2019s least happy with.  It\u2019s called The Ending. Nothing in this section is *wrong* per se but it could be expressed better because it\u2019s very easy to misconstrue it to mean, \u201cpre-plan the climax.\u201d  What this section is trying to get at is that it\u2019s worth giving some thought to what *an* ending will look like and what is likely to be at stake, especially relative to the player\u2019s kickers.  The mini-supplement Demon Cops actually has a nice example of this in the sample scenario provided.  In addition to giving you the back-story and relationship map there\u2019s a little side bar illustrating the issues implied in it.  It basically says, \u201cThe story is over when these are resolved.\u201d  How and when they resolve is of course still a function of play itself.<br/><br/>The fourth sub-section is called \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d  This section is about how the player characters relate to each other.  Again, it can be badly misconstrued as text on \u201chow to keep the party together.\u201d  That is not the case, in fact the entire section is about combating the party or squad mentality or at least acknowledging why those setups are problematic if you\u2019re determined to use them.  The idea here is that it is a good idea to have the players angled at each other in SOME manner.  They do not need to be a team but they should touch in some way.<br/><br/>The third section of chapter four is called Actual Play.  The first two sub-sections highlight some subtleties about the roles of Game Master and the Players.  In the game master section it basically says that \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2026\u201d isn\u2019t allowed except as a clarifying point on the situation at hand (i.e. \u201cI run up to him!\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t he\u2019s on a 20 foot balcony, remember?\u201d or \u201cI open fire with machine gun!\u201d  \u201cYou sure?  There\u2019s a school bus full of children there!\u201d).  Also \u201cYou feel\u2026\u201d is off limits.  The Player section talks mainly about how it\u2019s the player\u2019s responsibility to find reasons for his character to be invested in the situation.  The kicker is the first step in that direction.<br/><br/>The third subsection is titled: Currency.  And here it is, folks!  The whole damn engine of the game on one page.  Read it carefully.  Read it literally.  Almost everything I\u2019ve written about in my previous essays is to be found somewhere on that page.  Notice how it clearly states that the \u201cdamage rules\u201d are not separate rules but are instead an example of the currency in action.  Now extrapolate that to other situations that might arise in game.  Hell, over lunch I realized something!  If something has a lasting effect then go ahead and let it have a lasting effect; those victories from flirting with the woman in the bar?  Don\u2019t just roll them over to the next roll.  Fuck it.  Penalize EVERY interaction the woman has with the man.  That\u2019s how physical damage works.  That\u2019s how Binding rituals work.<br/><br/>The fourth sub-section is titled, Making The Story Work and has three sub-sub-sections.  The first two of those are about Bangs and Pacing.  And if you read carefully you\u2019ll see that this is the structure of play.  Bangs have gotten enormous discussion elsewhere and the Pacing section is basically a description of scene framing.  Together it basically states that the GM is intended to move the characters from crisis-point to crisis-point with little to no down time.<br/><br/>The last sub-sub-section called, Sneaky Player Tricks.  It\u2019s basically how to turn common conflict avoidance tactics back on the players; given seemingly bland character combinations X and Y, do Z.<br/><br/>The fourth and final section of chapter four is called, The Training Run.  It\u2019s a proto-scenario to get you started.  It very clearly states that it is NOT complete.  That it is intended only as a starting sand box to start playing with the core concepts.  Using it will not yield the full Sorcerer experience, only a taste.<br/><br/>And there you have it.  How To Play Sorcerer.  All spelled out, if you read it literally and check your play history at the door.  Funny I missed it considering the chapter is called: Playing Sorcerer.  Christopher Kubasik and I were whispering about this in another thread and we both liked the word Autistic to describe the text.  It tells you everything you need to know exactly once in very literal terms and leaves extracting the subtleties and nuances of its applications as an exercise for the reader.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134546/#Comment_134546" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T05:27:07+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  5:27AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The GM should not just wave off a Demon\u2019s Need simply because he feels it\u2019s not appropriate right now.

Last time the new people there sounded perplexed at the name (and the other indie RPG's I asked about), so clearly I don't own it. Does chapter four describe this as a rule? That's not a rule - I can only think it unhealthy to try and treat it as a rule.<br/><br/>Take your example where you have to describe an apple without using the words green or red. Now look at it from the outset - if I think that as an activity I find it dull or something I wouldn't enjoy, I decline your offer of doing the description. Everythings fine and healthy.<br/><br/>Okay, here gameplay has already been entered into and bing, this situation comes up where apparently the demon should pursue it's need. But you know what, at this moment I find that dull - or lets say to make it more of a contrast, I actively dislike that. But that'd be breaking the rules not to do it. But not breaking the rules would be to do something I actively dislike, thus breaking my own sensibilities. It's an unhealthy situation.<br/><br/>The key factor to it not being a rule is this: a situation where I don't want to pursue the demons need is all too likely to happen. If you press it as a rule, then you'll get into the above situation. Off the top of my head another approach would be to simply find a need the GM is super excited about, but not press it as a rule - that way out of sheer enthusiasm he'll stick to it most of the time, rather than out of a social agreement to follow rules.<br/><br/>I say this in reference to your interpretation of the text - I don't own it (and even if I did own the pulp and ink, it doesn't tell me the designers intention). Also you can ignore this and I'm totally cool with that, as I write this post as if I'd seen someone using machinery with no safetyguards, and I fear their hair may be caught and pulled into the gears at any moment. It's kind of a selfish post on my part, so I feel okay if hair does get caught and...well, never mind, but I feel better if because some information was given on it (even if in the end it wasn't relevant info - still better to cover the chance of scalping).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134550/#Comment_134550" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T05:54:36+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  5:54AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would think not wanting to deal with a demon's need is like not wanting to pay rent when you land on opponents property in Monopoly.

Do you mean as a player or as the GM? Remember demons in Sorcerer are NPCs and controlled by the GM.<br/><br/>A demon does not "pursue" its Need, it simply goes into Need, which means it gets all cranky and potentially more dangerous and in the end maybe even rebellious. If you find that dull, well, Sorcerer's probably not of interest to you. It's part of the game. It's part of what you'd have to buy into as a participant in the game, of what Jesse mentions under "Customization [...] Humanity, Sorcerers, Demons and Tone", because these will inflict on exactly how a demon reacts when in Need and so on.<br/><br/>But I agree with Jesse that playing the demons according to their Needs and Desires and applying those in play is hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134576/#Comment_134576" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T08:47:06+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  8:47AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>And there you have it.

Let's make up a rule for a new game - the GM has a deck of cards and goes into another room, away from everyone, to shuffle it. And then the game has a bunch of 'rules' about how the GM can't stack the deck just because he feels like it.<br/><br/>Why are we, the authors of this game, sending the GM to the other room if playing the game doesn't involve trusting him? If the game does involve trusting him, why are we adding a bunch of 'rules' saying how he shouldn't just stack the deck when he wants to? In terms of Per Fisher's comment, if the game is about the GM enjoying shuffling the cards properly, why are we putting in rules that tell him it would be cheating not to do that?<br/><br/>When a situation triggers a demons need is a subjective GM decision, not an objective one (like paying rent in monopoly is). Being subjective, it's like sending the GM off to another room to shuffle. That's my estimate of it - we can discuss that as it may be the main issue here. But that estimate is what I've used as the basis of my posts.<br/><br/><br/>Hi Per Fisher,<br/><br/>If the GM has bought into the idea, why the need for 'Hey, you'd better have the demon pursue that need! The one you've totally bought into and want to apply. If you don't apply need then, your breaking the rules!'. Why underline that they would be breaking the rules if they are all too happy to pursue it? Why is it even stated as a rule? The rule is; the thing you came to enjoy, you have to have?? The only practical use that rule will see is if doesn't actually enjoy it, which takes you to the situation I outlined in the previous post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134759/#Comment_134759" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T22:51:08+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 10:51PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calan, I too am not following your logic. Sorcerer is a game in which sorcerer PCs bind demon NPCs. The demons have needs. The sorcerer fulfills those needs or the demons get all pouty and eventually shrivel up and go poof. That's foundational.  Its not about trust. Its the GMs job to keep track of the demons and their needs in play. Its cool if you're not into that and want to do something else, but I would suggest not playing a game where that is the pivotal relationship between the PCs and the NPCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134899/#Comment_134899" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T11:38:35+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 11:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br/><br/>Roger has the right of it.  I was talking about the contents of Chapter Four and not my essays.  And I agree that the Chapter is slanted more towards the GM but a) Sorcerer is still a very GM heavy game and b) Sorcerer benefits greatly from the players understanding the whole process of play even if 80% of that process is managed, I hesitate to use the word controlled, by the GM.<br/><br/>For example regarding the text on The Ending it's just as important for the players to be considering the resolution of their Kickers as the GM to understand what's at stake in his scenario.  If the GM comes to the table with a Sorcerous Technicality and Back-Story prepared before play then it can be useful to expose part of the prep during character creation so that the players may position their characters (mostly via their Kickers) relative to it in a fashion that interests them.  That's why that section begins with discussion that the whole play group can be involved at any level that is appropriate.<br/><br/>I also suggest that the idea that the players are responsible for retroactively motivating their characters into action is no small suggestion but rather vital for successful play.<br/><br/>As for Calan's complaint, James has the right of it.  Yes, if I say you have to describe an apple without using the words red or green and you're not into that then you walk away.  Absolutely.  But what you don't do is ask for special permission to use the words red and green among a group of people who have already agreed that they're going to describe apples without using the words red and green.<br/><br/>That said, however, I have been in this situation.  I'm GMing a Sorcerer game and I totally spot a situation where a player's demon should go into Need and I suddenly feel complete discomfort at that because I'm worried it's going to over complicate the situation or make things narratively messy.  Every time I've given into that discomfort and pushed off or ignored the Demon's Need situation I've regretted it.  The situation that I thought was complicated "enough" actually falls kind of flat.  Every time I've pushed past the discomfort and just did what the game instructed me to do, the situation has been emotionally explosive.<br/><br/>So, yes, to some extent I'm saying that even in situations of creative discomfort, trust the game and do it anyways.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135016/#Comment_135016" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T02:39:27+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  2:39AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2008 4:59AM by Callan_S.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, lets take the apple example and add one extra rule. Okay, he has to describe an apple in one paragraph, without using the words red or green. And the one, extra special rule: He polices this - no one else can. No one else in the world, just to be absolutely clear.<br/><br/>Okay, he decides to go for it and - writes a description which has the words red and green in it. You can see this plain as day in front of you.<br/><br/>But policing him would be breaking the rules. Are we agreed policing him would be breaking these rules I described?<br/><br/><br/>Okay, from what I see reported here about sorcerer (from a second hand report, I acknowledge), the GM decides when a need kicks in. Deciding this has been assigned specifically to him. Indeed, it is entirely up to him - he polices himself on this.<br/><br/>Now, to then apply this:\n<blockquote>The GM should not just wave off a Demon\u2019s Need simply because he feels it\u2019s not appropriate right now. That\u2019s breaking the rules.</blockquote>\nIs to break the rules. Just saying it breaks the rules. Because saying it is policing it, when that job was assigned to the GM. Even if the author himself says something like this, that's breaking the rule. The rule being that the GM polices himself.<br/><br/>I might be getting the wrong end of the stick. Perhaps this is supposed to be decided by commitee or something like that. However, I would have expected a text describing everyone sitting down to talk, rather than focusing purely on the GM. Have I got this the wrong way around and it's a commitee thing? If that's the case, I think you should be talking more about the group deciding what situations set off a need. And I'll leave the suggestion at that.<br/><br/>If I do understand it correctly, it's breaking the rules to say this stuff, as much as a GM breaking the rules in not applying need. Your both as bad as each other - that's why it's not a rule and that's why it's unhealthy.<br/><br/>Even if you don't see it applying to how sorcerer is described in this thread, atleast you must find my apple example from above is unhealthy. Does everyone agree that it is, or at the very least paradoxical? I hope there is atleast shared ground in terms of that. By crum, I hope so.<br/><br/>PS: It's Callan with two L's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135066/#Comment_135066" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T19:11:27+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  7:11PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, sorry Calllan (there's an extra L to make up for last time).<br/><br/>As for whether its healthy or not to have the GM policing Needs (the apple stuff is just making the discussion more obtuse), my read on Sorcerer is that it has a relatively traditional GM role, where the GM "roleplays the player-characters' Bound demons." The GM is told to "develop his or her personal concept of what they're like." Some people think centralized GM authority is a bad thing. I don't think there's anything wrong with a GM creating and playing the adversity in a game, but to each his/her own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
