(Successfully rolls "Shut Someone Down")<br/>PC 1: I'm still gonna' eat this kitten!<br/>MC: No, you can't. You've been shut down. Also, PC 2 gave you "Kitten Eater" as a condition. <br/>PC 1: Boo!<br/>PC 2: Yay!<br/></i><br/>or<br/><br/><i>PC 1: I'm gonna to eat this kitten!<br/>PC 2: Don't eat that kitten, you monster! (Successfully rolls "Shut Someone Down")<br/>PC 1: I'm still gonna' eat this kitten!<br/>MC: Sure go ahead, you just have the "Kitten Eater" condition that PC 2 gave you. <br/>PC 1: Yay!<br/>PC 2: Meh.</i><br/><br/>In the first example, it's the old bugaboo of telling a PC what they can and cannot do, but it gives the move more weight. In the second example, PC 1 can still do what he wants (with a bit of a drawback), and PC 2 feels like she wasted a roll.<br/>This is especially important when PC 1 instead says "I'm going to stab PC 2 right in the face!"<br/><br/>I've been dithering back and forth on this in-game, leaning towards the first example. It only really came to the forefront in our last session where there was more than a little PC-on-PC violence. <br/><br/>I realize, of course, that Strings can be spent and XP offered in either case, but still...<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408190/#Comment_408190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T17:57:51+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  5:57PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neither of those are examples of shutting someone down, in my eyes.<br/><br/>You engage that move when you bully people, silence people, or attempt to shove them away from you. If a PC goes to eat a kitten, and PC 2 wants to stop them, that doesn't trigger a move. At least, not yet. You have to say something like, "Okay, PC 2, obviously you're not cool with this course of action. So what do you do?"<br/><br/>If PC 2 tries to shame and guilt and threaten PC 1 away from their course of action, and in so doing re-adjust the power balance between them, then they're <i>shutting someone down</i>. Telling someone not to do something? That's just regular conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408192/#Comment_408192" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T18:27:20+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  6:27PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, glib kitten-eating might not have been a good example.

In order to strip someone of some of the power they have over you, and/or to make it easier for you to hurt them and control them in the future.<br/><br/>Why would you do it narratively? Because it makes sense in the fiction. Because your character has so much hubris that they think it's <i>always</i> an appropriate time to belittle and silence people.<br/><br/>Is it a strong move strategically to try and belittle/silence someone who's currently advancing on you with a knife drawn? No, probably not. A bad idea in real life and in this game. It is likely to end with you getting stabbed. But maybe you've decided that acting like an unflinching badass is more important than emerging unscathed.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that the baddies that Buffy fights? They are constantly rolling to shut her down midway through a fight. Their tactic is to try and make her cry, hoping that maybe she'll devolve into a mess of self-loathing and forget to stab them.

It can't really be used to stop someone from hitting you, running out of the house, etc.<br/><br/>We've been doing this wrong at home.<br/><br/>Assuming I have a string on them, I can of course make them hesitate or Hold Steady before they hit me or run away.

That's how you know they're in the same scene.<br/><br/>If someone succeeds at <i>shutting someone down</i>, then the power balance and relative vulnerability between those character has just shifted. That's what those mechanics mean. Should characters reflect those shifts in their actions and mannerisms? Yeah, definitely! In addition to the fact that characters should always react to what one another do and say, they should furthermore have those power shifts come out in the characters' actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408230/#Comment_408230" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T03:26:16+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  3:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, I've come to realize that my confusion came from my fundamental misunderstanding on what you meant by <i>shutting someone down</i>. <br/>I read "When you shut someone down" as "When you try to stop someone from doing something." <br/>Now that I know that's wrong (it's more about causing emotional or social duress), it all falls together. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408235/#Comment_408235" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T04:30:07+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  4:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah. I don't see Monsterhearts as a game about controlling what other people do, so much as influencing how they feel (or how others feel about them). When I introduce the moves I talk about them in terms of how they allow you to influence others or yourself. For Shut Someone Down, I say this is where you're influencing others using a verbal or emotional attack.<br/><br/>I understand the confusion as the example in the book has both a verbal attack and Vanessa succeeding in stopping the bully taking her backpack. What I now understand is that the mechanical (i.e. mandated) outcome is the application of the condition on the bully, influencing how others feel about him. The fact that he then stops trying to get her backpack is the MC's narrative choice, based on the Principles. The MC (or PC if the bully was a player) could have carried on with trying to get the backpack - as anyone could try to keep on doing something in real life no matter how much ridicule it exposed them to - until Vanessa physically prevents it by either usi.g Run Away or Lash Out Physically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408240/#Comment_408240" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T04:37:29+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  4:37AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, knowing all this now makes "Call People on Their Shit" and "Intervene in an Act of Violence" a lot more important to my group, too. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408288/#Comment_408288" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T13:27:12+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  1:27PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on, Joe.<br/><br/>What about the "hold steady" thing?

Depending on their Cold score, forcing them to hold steady might be a big barrier or a little one.

But, when Caleb burned down Lilly's home, even though Lilly was physically unhurt, that triggered Primal Dominance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408420/#Comment_408420" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T20:11:26+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  8:11PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just want to say, discussions like this warm my metaphorical cockles.

Our Werewolf met the Mortal (his spurned ex) on the school steps, in the cold rain. She'd just been knocked over by some girls who are bullying her, and her glasses went flying. So the Werewolf stepped on the glasses, deliberately breaking them, then pressed them into her hand, cutting her palm.<br/><br/>We rolled "lash out physically", and it was perfect (he got a String on her through Primal Dominance, as well). Better yet, he rolled a 7-9, which meant he had to choose a downside, and the only option that made sense was that she gained a String on him, as well: you see, the Werewolf was trying to be tough in front of the people watching, but we all know that he still cares for her. She was looking so pitiful, sitting there in the rain, that the guilt racks him intensely, though he doesn't let it show.<br/><br/>So thank you for sharing that! It created a great moment in our game.<br/><br/>(We didn't count it as harm, though we decided that it left a scar - the scene was a flashback, after all.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408432/#Comment_408432" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T22:55:50+00:00" title="March  7, 2013 10:55PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408445/#Comment_408445" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T01:35:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  1:35AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really broken.
