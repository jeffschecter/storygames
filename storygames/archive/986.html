                    Another thread that I thought might be cool to dig into from time to time...<br/><br/>What are you playing? Looking at RPGs, boardgames, other games. Plus what you just finished or are just getting into.<br/><br/><b>RPGs:</b> With my weekly group (though we haven't met for two weeks due to sickness/business/other) we're about 3 episodes into a 9-episode arc for Primetime Adventures.  It's basically Timecop, but with less Van Damme and more Continuum. <br/><br/>With my bi-weekly group, we recently finished a brief TSOY game at a cliffhanger, and will be moving forward next time with Mark C's Lankhmar Burning Wheel game. Mark just rebooted his idea ("lords of the thieves' guild"), and I'm really looking forward to it.<br/><br/><b>Board Games</b> I find BG's hit-or-miss. Some are awesome, some are tiring, and in many cases my attention will begin to wander halfway through. I'm actually looking for some new board games that are social, and a good balance between luck and skill.<br/><br/>Two days ago we played Descent (the big-bad-dungeon crawl game by Fantasy Flight, in the tradition of old HeroQuest). It was a combination of AWESOME (GM gets a resource token thing which he trades in to bring in more monsters, traps, etc) and WHAT THE FUCK (tokens, Tokens, MOTHERFUCKING <b>TOKENS</b> FOR EVERY FUCKING THING! <b>TOKENS!!!!</b>).  Also, the rules were written in a manner which suggests heavy drug use on the editor's part ("Let's make sure to keep the rules as scattered apart as possible over two books!").  But right as we "got it", and started making good ground, I got into it a little more.  I'm interested in giving it a shot again at some point. Later.<br/><br/>I haven't played Jungle Speed for a month, but I can destroy anyone <br/><br/><b>Other</b><br/>Just got Shadow of the Colossus, Kuon and Soul Calibur 3 from eBay, they're spiffy for different reasons and I'm thinking of things that I can pull out of them for my gaming (Kuon has the cool setting of Heian-era Japan, SC3 has an interesting highlander-like "Fight!" story which might be cool in an all- one on one combat game, and Shadow of the Colossus... hmmm... cool game and light but interesting background, but the only thing it contributes most is that it makes my thumbs hurt :-(    ).<br/><br/>Also, I finished Final Fantasy XII.  I was a big fan of X for various reasons (theme, character, art, setting, character/art design), and FF XII... well, it really didn't contribute anything much to my "RPG Thoughts", save, "Do Better Than This". Which isn't hard. Gameplay is fun in the traditional "console rpg fighty game" sense. No jumping puzzles or lame/impossible mini-games, though, so that was nice.                </div>

<b>RPGs</b>:  TSOY-a-go-go:  Our fun "Battlestar Galactica in a dungeon" motif is moving from "Let's all talk about how fucked we are" to "Oh shit!  Monsters!  There actually <b>are</b> big freakin' monsters in this abandoned city.  We are so fucked!"  We've simultaneously moved away from talky-talky Keys toward more aggressive ones.  There's a chicken-and-egg thing there that's fascinating to watch in action ... but also, watching the Keys, I have a good sense that these characters are near running their course.  The story is almost over, whatever twists our devious GM may have in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Capes:  We'll probably go back to our long-running campaign.  People have the itch.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain Witch / Burning Wheel:  These two are each warming up in the bullpen for a one-shot game on a weekend some time upcoming.  I want to get a feel for the systems first-hand.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Board Games</b>:  Got myself some Memoir '44 and Jungle Speed, both of which I can play for entertainment with my young son.  People to play either with me competitively are a bit thin on the ground.                        </div>

<b>RPGs:</b>  Hip-deep in Galactic with the Durham 3.  I'm playing The Reverend Pollard Kubb, a half-preacher half-con man who lost his last conflict and is now the collared love slave of Sheyna, leader of the lizard-riding swamp people on whatever backwater hell-hole he landed on.  Good times.  My other group's "Chronicles of the White Tiger" TSOY game is wrapping up in a month or so, and my evil geomancer is determined to back his evil brother's bid for the throne of the kingdom of Ba, which is going to be a spectacular catastrophe.<br><br><b>Board games:</b>  Tsuro is popular at lunch breaks.  Jungle Speed is more so.  <br><br><b>Other</b>:  Improv!  Starting the second week of a long form/Harold class.  Keeping an eye on both Portal and Team Fortress 2.

                            LARP: I've got this big forest in my backyard... We have up to three acres to play with. A huge trench divides part of it, and there are some bog-like sections and such. Me and my friends are going to try and run a Vietnam PoW-style LARP there next weekend. I'm going to take many, many pictures if we do.<br>
<br>
RPG: I hope to run My Life with Master this Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
DRAMA/IMPROV: I figure this is close enough to RPG's to qualify. I'm in a two week long drama program right now. We're putting on a play called Girl in the Mirror, which is the story of a girl who attempted suicide, and while in the hospital revisits scenes from her life.... trying to sort out the pieces.<br/>
<br/>
I've also been doing a lot of improv, theatre games, and workshops on character development in the program.<br/>
It's definitely cool to see some stuff port over to RPGs (there was a thread about this a few months ago, if I recall.)                        </br></br></div>

                            SC3 has a story? Huh. I was _wondering_ what that annoying thing between the fights was.<br/>
<br/>
*RPG:* HeroQuest with Thomas, maybe HeroQuest with Mike, Exalted... Thomas' HQ game is super great. We're only a few episodes in but I'm totally hooked. It's actually really nice to be in a game where I can choose to exert GMish forces when I want, but not feel bad about handing that job off to someone.<br/>
<br/>
*BG:* Bitin' Off Hedz and Jacob Marley, Esq. are the games-of-the-month around here. JME is pretty intriguing! It's got that strongly competitive vibe of Settlers, but somehow, it doesn't make things feel personal.<br/>
<br/>
*VG:* Playing a lot of Super Smash Bros. Melee (even though I am not actually that much of a fan), and a good deal of SC2 and 3. Borrowed Star Ocean from a friend of mine, but I'm not sure I'm that stoked about playing it; I went through a significant part of it some years ago, and am not particularly sanguine about playing through that part again.                        </div>

                            RPG:  Running Shadowrun, the game that's bringing me pain.  Playing in a friend's Exalted game, which we've upgraded to 2nd ed in its third rules incarnation (it was originally Fate, then Weapons of the Gods). Sufficiently jazzed from Dexcon to be warmign up some one shots. Got a group for Mortal Coil, hopefully for Next Wednesday.  Fred is making PTA noises, so I'll be curious abtou that, and The princes Kingdom may slip past my defenses and result in my running dogs, or somethign like it.<br/><br/>Board: My experience with Descent mirrored Andy's, though my final assessment was "Next time we play this f-ing game, we're using some f-ing pencils and paper".  Shadows of Camelot remains the perenial favorite, though Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, citadels and Runebound are making good showings.  Arkham Horror keeps taunting us with it's beautiful hugeness.<br/><br/>Other: Between games at the moment.  Suikoden V gave me everything i could want, so I'm sated for a bit, and as much as I like my Mintendo DS, none of the games have really grabbed me yet.  Waiting for the reinvention of FFIII, I guess, or something.  Also, I taught a friend's 5 year old to say "In your face!" when she wins at War, so next I'm gonna teach her to play button men.  Brennan can testify that I'm unsafe near children.<br/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Our fighterey guys were as happy as clams.  For the kung fu, ass kicking part of things, the system was all that and a bag of chips.<br/><br/>Problem was, for our Scholar and Magistrate, it didn't hold up so well.  The Courtier/Medicine/Taoist magic system is very intellectually interesting, but it didn't have the pure coolness of the kung fu, and those players were really feeling deprived of an opportunity to shine.  Those concerns, combined with the fact that we were all pretty much impressed with 2nd edition, was enough for the players to go to the GM and say "Let's change it."<br/><br/>Since we switched, the combat is definately less fluid, but the utility charms have gone a long way towards rounding out everyones personal sphere of badassity, so it seems a fair exchange.  Also, as we start bringing in other Exalt types as friends and foes, it's a bit easier to do:  As an example, we never really got Lunars to be very satisfying with WOTG.<br/><br/>We still dig WOTG, and the GM has stated this just means that sometime we'll run a straight WOTG game, and I'm all for it.  That said, i think if someone were feeling both crazy and willing to ignore copyright, the two systems could be knitted together very tightly, but the GM in question doesn't have the patience for that, and I try to limit my madness to games I run. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Things have obviously been conspiring against me, gaming-wise, because the only thing I've played this month is one session of PTA. Granted, that session rocked hard. I wrote about it <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20518.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Usually, there's be some Pirate's Cove or Ticket to Ride and some Scrabble, with maybe some other story games, too. But so far...PTA is it for this month.                        </div>

                            My gaming life is a bit lackluster at the moment. Between graduation, three weeks in England, and moving into a new apartment in midsummer heat, I haven't had all that much time. (Nancy has BitV, but only for one more week, sadly)<br/>
<br/>
VG: I just spent almost the entire drive from the SF Bay Area to Seattle playing the PSP port of Valkyrie Profile. Good times. Also, I've been playing a bit of Pikmin, looking forward to the recently-acquired Pikmin 2, and that's about it.<br/>
<br/>
BG: Played a few rounds of Milles Bornes. When that game goes well, it's fun, but our first two of three hands were extremely boring, because we were all stopped and couldn't get moving again for the better portion of the draw deck. Then we played a round of Magdar, which was fun, but none of us really had a handle on the probabilites involved, so it was a lot of shooting in the dark.                        </div>

                            Ahoy from the shores of mainstream gaming!<br/>
<br/>
Every week or so we play two things:<br/>
<br/>
Star Wars d20 Revised and...<br/>
<br/>
Gotham City Adventure!<br/>
<br/>
I'll give more details on them later, actually the two of them are pretty instructive from story points of view and have their own challenges.  But for now, you can check out the website of my nerdy Star Wars character at:<br/>
<br/>
http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/gaming/patience.html<br/>
<br/>
SPECIAL CONTEST: Just before Palpatine gave his "we are now an Empire" speech in Episode III, what do you think my nerdy good guy Senator was doing in that big chamber? You're right. A FILIBUSTER!  Highlights can be read here:<br/>
<br/>
http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/gaming/lenspeech.txt<br/>
<br/>
Can you name any one of the three sources I cribbed from?<br/>
<br/>
And the (woefully un-updated but still cool) Gotham City Adventure! page is at: http://yearone.scarymonsters.net                        </div>

                            well, here's my unusual burst of activity for July :P<br/>

RPG: sadly, only online play. The good part is that it is *awesome* online play. Playing in Fred's Patchwork world HQ game and in the Ensemble playtest (the one that looks like Heroes) with Alex and Dave.<br/>
<br/>
VG: Masters of Orion. The first, best, one. :P                        </div>

                            BWHQ has been playing Memoir 44 hardcore. We got the Pacific Theater pack this week. Last night we played three missions. Wake Island (Japanese lost one and won one -- Damn you, Olavsrud!), Guam Landings (Japanese were  overwhelmed both times -- Damn you, Tierney!)  and the awesome, horrible, terrible, why-I-did-even-set-this-board-up Meat Grinder scenario. Japanese won that one handily both times. That scenario should be renamed the Friend Grinder. By the 6th victory point for the Japs it seems like the Marines players were ready to throttle them -- both times! <br/>
<br/>
The Terrain Pack and the PT pack are both really awesome. But the Japanese Command special rules take it to the stratosphere. Ignore the first flag baby! No retreat! Move 2 and Close Assault and +1D on the Close Assault. BONZAI!<br/>

                            Two week hiatus right now on the rpg front, kicking off again in about a fortnight.<br/><br/>RPGwise we were playing Zenobia, the Paul Elliott/Mithras ancient Near East setting using a mix of Runequest second edition and Call of Cthulhu.  Going fairly well.  I may run some Ars Magica soon but haven't decided yet.  Probably continue with Zenobia when we restart in a week or so while I think about what to do next.<br/><br/>No boardgames currently, though I did play Battle of the Bands with my wife the other day.  It's a comedic card based game about rock bands, oddly I felt terribly guilty when I played a card condemning Mr Cuddles the cat to an untimely death.  Funny how we anthropomorphise things.<br/><br/>Computer games, I'm trying to finish Warcraft 3 with which I have become thoroughly bored.  Not sure why I'm bothering, most levels I now cheat through as actually playing is too dull.  I'm just curious to see the story I guess, but playing through it is a hell of a waste of time.  I need to get back to Rome:  Total Realism and Broken Sword 3.                        </div>

                            That's awesome, Matt!  For some reason, when I was GMing Unknown Armies, it always helped to be a little tanked (this and Star Wars d6, for some weird reason, and not really for any other game). Great to hear you're back in the saddle, how did the game play out?<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>

                            It was fun, we were more than a little tanked by the end though, and it turned into a mostly GM-less Dawn of the Dead free for all near the end. Very fun, though, and definately something to try again soon.                        </div>

                            RPGs: John Walton's running an espionage game powered by DitV (Operation: Dogs in the Vineyard) and that's really awesome. I've also got a variety of one-shots burning a whole in my psychic pocket.<br/>
<br/>
*EDIT:* I just want to add that in the espionage game, I'm playing a naive young neocon acolyte from Harvard. Woo!<br/>
<br/>
Board Games: I find that _Betrayal at House on the Hill_ has been getting more popular around those geek circles lately, and played two games of it on Friday. Good times! I was eaten by a Cthulu. It's a random game that's not tactically deep, but its randomness also makes it quirky and light fare, good for a wacky game among friends.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a superhot Secret Preview of Dreamblade is coming to 10x10room soon.<br/>
<br/>
VG: Despite the relatively new PS2, I'm playing Guitar Hero and Katamari 2 at a stately pace, i.e. basically whenever my guitar-buddy / girlfriend are over. I'm buying GH2 a few seconds after it comes out.                        </div>

                            RPG: In my regular Tuesday night group, we've just done two sessions of Universalis - the first was a documentary, a 60 Minutes style investigation into a new process that allowed people to network their brains together.  The second was no-holds-barred, no coins, no complications, sleep deprived craziness set in a retirement village for assassins.<br/>
<br/>
And a bunch of us have just finished the first season of Phoenix, our PTA game set in a small town with a Branch Davidian/Waco-style cult compound on the outskirts.  Best game ever, for me. Actually.  <br/>
<br/>
That was pretty dark, so we followed up with another PTA game: Extreme Source Board Racers - Generation One Million.  8 players, dark future hoverboard riding anime, and very very extreme.<br/>
<br/>
VIDEO: Katamari Damarcy, We love Katamari, Singstar, Ico, and Fahrenheit.  I thought Fahrenheit was going to be the first Narrativist roleplaying game when I started, but then it jumped the shark in a big way.                        </div>

                            I've been playing a ton of RPGs recently.  In the last two months: Multiple times of PTA, The Roach, 1001 Nights (fuck yes!), In A Wicked Age, The Drifter's Escape, The Face of Angels (fuck yesser!), and Polaris.  I've also been playing in Erick Wujcik's Amber game weekly, which has started slow but has been getting cooler.<br/><br/>If your game can be played in one-shot form, let me know.  We'll want to have a go at it, almost certainly.<br/><br/>I'm gearing up for a trip to the states, where I expect at least some of the following: Drifters, Bliss Stage, 1001 Nights, D&amp;D 3.5, Iron Heroes.  And that's not even counting GenCon.<br/><br/>I haven't played a ton of board games yet, but I'm poking at a card game design (Tentatively called "Doki Doki: The Game of Shojo Manga Combat!") so I'll probably be playtesting that soon.<br/><br/>The only video-game I've been playing recently is Escape Velocity: Nova, which is hot but old.  My friends at home are convincing me to start WoW, though...                        </div>

<b>RPGs:</b><br/>
This weekend, I played Spione and a quick demo of Sorcerer &amp; Sword with Ron himself, which was great and now makes me want to play more of it at once. With my regular "we try different games" group, the last one we played was All Flesh Must Be Eaten (I head-butted a zombie!) and the next will be The Shadow of Yesterday. My "old school pals" group is finishing a tiresome Star Wars d6 campaign, but now it's my turn to pick the next game. Yay!Three weeks from now will be GroFaFo summer rally, where I am scheduled for a whole bunch of cool games, including The Ancient and Venerable Art of Tippling.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Board Games:</b><br/>
Just your usual German boardgames: Settlers, Carcassonne, and Ingenious. My girlfriend loves them more than I do.                        </div>

<b>RPGs</b><br>Games I run:<br><br/>Sunday Group - Weapons of the Gods and playtesting Coming of Age<br/>  - Pretty standard WoG, although with a strong bent towards the Daoist Magic (two scholars and one warrior). <br/>  - Coming of Age is my, well, coming of age RPG. Second round of playtesting went much better, proof that some games work better without a GM.<br/><br/>Monday Group - Iron Heroes<br/>  - Also pretty standard, recruited for this promising the heavy tactics, set in a largely player inspired world, essentially Egypt under Carthage, if Rome had never become much of an empire. <br/><br/>Tuesday Group - Alternating Aberrant and Legend of the Five Rings<br/>  - Aberrant has been very long running focusing on rebuilding the setting due to early actions of the PCs. We've alternated the plot arcs from teachers at an university for novas, and students at that same university. For the students, I've been using a modified card XP system, based on Pure Shoujo, which really helped to drive the action, as players tried to fulfil the actions on the cards they drew.<br/>  - Lo5R is a more recent game, focusing on a handful of Magistrates investigating crimes and dealing with oni-controlled bandits. Mostly trying to balance the needs of the intrigue characters with the combat ones.<br/>  - I've discovered that if run alternating games they should either use the same mechanics, or use very different ones. The similar d10 pools have causes at least mild confusion. <br/><br/>Thursday Group - Spookshow and an Over the Edge oneshot<br/>  - Spookshow is just starting with the PCs being Interpol / European agents, seems to be leaning towards almost licit investigation, but we'll see how the first mission ends up.<br/>  - I ran over the edge as a quick, fairly standard intro to RPGs for one of my regular's sister. This seems to have worked well, and she seems interested in joining the Spookshow game if/when she comes to town for a longer span. <br/><br/>Extra - Last Weekend - Heavily Modified D&amp;D<br/>  - Removed all spell casters except Ranger and stripped his spells too, also cut Monks. Replaced them with the Tome of Magic and Incarnum classes.<br/>  - Used Iron Heroes style traits for races.<br/>  - Ran a one shot, "let's see how this works" sort of game. The utility magics in those two books were quite fun for everyone, the only one who felt left out played a fighter/rogue without magic, who suffered largely because I didn't have time to set up a mini board. Sneak attacks and flanking are much harder to work without them.<br/><br/>The game I play - Star Wars homebrew (based on Aeon/Trinity)<br/>  - This hasn't happened too consistently, and will be ending soonish. <br/>  - I'm playing a rebel major who grew up as a blackpowder muskateer and has gone from being the boarding party leader to  being the back-up pilot and resident paper-pusher.<br/><br/><b>Board Games</b><br/><br/>Various Icehouse games. Shadows over Camelot. Three Dragon Ante.<br/><br/><b>Video Games</b><br/><br/>Evil Genius, my PS2 is now hostage to a house guest playing Chrono Cross.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </br></br></div>

                            I haven't done much gaming over the last year, but right now my new wife's son is down visiting, and he's interested in games and gaming, so we've been playing a fair bit of stuff with him.  What we've played in the last month or so:<br/><br/>Board Games:  <b>Dungeon</b>.  It's fairly quick, and simple enough that my 7-year-old can also play.<br/><br/>Tactical Games:  <b>Melee</b>.  We've played it a couple of times.  I'm planning on introducing Wizard next, then the whole TFT -- which is a nice way to structure getting into an RPG, so that rules can be learned a little at a time.  And last night, I broke out the <b>Lost Worlds</b> gamebooks, and Max and I did a quick fight -- man w. sword and shield vs. skeleton w. scimitar and shield.  Planning to do some more with those tonight.<br/><br/>RPGs:  A <b>simplified D&amp;D</b> homebrew, GMed by my wife, Sandy.  She also did the simplifying, with some input from Max and me.  Max got pretty silly playing it, but hey... he's nine.  I was silly with it when I started too, and I was older.  I had fun indulging his silliness a bit, and playing a money-motivated halfling thief -- one who said "what's it worth to you?" any time anyone asked if he'd check for traps.<br/><br/>Computer Games:  I played <b>Gauntlet 2</b> with Max for a while a few weeks ago.  It was the first time I'd played it, and it brought back fond memories of the original Gauntlet... but it really needs a voice saying "Elf needs food badly!"<br/><br/>We went to the local game store yesterday, and picked up the "D&amp;D Player's Kit" for Max... for the price of the hardcover PH, it has a softcover PH, a quick-start rules booklet, a quick-start character generation booklet, a pack of minis, dice, and a blank character sheet (which seemed a bit of a rip... just one?).  He was also browsing All Flesh Must Be Eaten there, so I might run that for him...                        </div>

<b>RPG:</b><br/>* I'm running a back-to-basics, D&amp;D-esque Burning Wheel game inspired by some D&amp;D modules for my Tuesday group. The characters have wandered deep into the goblin kingdoms in an attempt to rescue a kidnapped burgomeister's daughter. They're currently in the crumbling  catacombs under a goblin fort and about to face off against some lizardmen. I think it's the first time I've ever run or played an honset-to-goodness dungeon crawl in Burning Wheel. Definitely different.<br/><br/>* My Thursday group is one session into a Donjon game, which comes on the heels of a two-session foray into D&amp;D 3.5, which followed some PTA. Our Black Company-inspired mercenaries fought some cultists, and my witch doctor got to enslave someone's soul as it fled his body. Awesome. We've got one more session of Donjon before we take Rune for a spin. Some Shadow of Yesterday, Conspiracy of Shadows, Nine Worlds, and more are on the table as well.<br/><br/>* The Saturday or Sunday group has created a bunch of three and four lifepath peasants for a Burning Wheel game that is going to take a tour of some pretty dark, Earthsea-inspired fantasy. We played our first session on Saturday, and it was teh rawk!<br/><br/><b>Board:</b> Memoir '44 owns our souls. We're playing it all the time. We've got the Eastern Front. We've got the Pacific Front. We've got the Terrain Pack. We can't stop. On Friday, we played until 3 a.m. Iwojima, i.e., The Meatgrinder, was an unholy scenario that I want to play again.<br/><br/><b>Other:</b> Rome: Total War. Trust me. I have sworn to flay the flesh from the pain-twisted bones of the Macedonians as their daughters watch, and line my gates with their skulls...<br/><br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/><br/>Did I just say that out loud?                        </div>

                            RPG:<br/><br/>Friday bi-weekly HERO game that switches between two <em>Champions</em> campaigns and one Fantasy HERO game. <em>Buffy</em> and BWr one-shots have been performed with this group, to mixed reviews. I currently have them on Double Secret Probaltion. Over the years (been about three), I've noticed quite a bit of geek fallacy stuff going on, and the HERO games were playing are getting less and less satisfying for me.<br/><br/>Saturday bi-weekly D&amp;D that (currently) switches between an <em>Age of Worms</em> campaign and a Wilderlands one. Wilderlands is what we did most recently. Play with this group is very tactical, generally in a good way.<br/><br/>Monday bi-weekly D&amp;D homebrew campaign run by one of the Saturday crew. Long-running game, probably the longest, continuus campiagn I've ever played.<br/><br/>BG:<br/><br/>Almost never. However, one of the Sat crew is a huge fan of the old FASA <em>Circus Imperium</em> boardgame form their Renegade Legion line. He has this custom-built board an acquaintance created from scratch that is one of the most beautiful pieces of gaming hardware I've ever seen. Basically, it's a big chariot-racing track (5' long or so) with Roman buildings and painted metal chaoriot minis, and the whole shebang collapses down into two custom-made boxes that look like Legion ammo containers. Insane.<br/><br/>So, we played it one night when the regular D&amp;D campiagns were on hiatus. I'm not much of a boardgamer, but I have to say that playing Circus Imperium was some of the most fun I've ever had with that group. Granted, the shots of Jager I was doing probably helped. (Beast frenzy = take a shot. Excellent house rule.)                        </div>

                            I'm actually playing RPGs again! First game since Forge Midwest.<br/><br/>It's a playtest of Galactic, with some fine folks out in Madison. We just did the setup session for it (it's old-school ultra-awesome campaign style, baby), and you can read about it <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/GalacticPlaytest/MadisonPlaytest" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>Other than that, sometimes I still play Civ III on my laptop.

                            In the way of RPGs, I'm running Dungeons and Dragons. It's kicking ass! The settings a big desert with lots of stuff rooted in Jewish, Coptic, and Zoroastrian myth, plus ninja-assassins and giant snails.<br/>
<br/>
Haven't been playing too many board games, but last night my friends and I got our Diplomacy on (one of the shortest Diplomacy games I've ever played -- within three years, France had invaded the British Isles, Turkey [me] and Italy had crushed Austria-Hungary between them, and the retreating British forces had taken over the entirety of Russia). We played a bit of Starfarers of Katan after that, but it was late enough that we quit without finishing.<br/>
<br/>
And there's been a bit of gambling for pocket change going on, with Hold 'em and Gin Rummy.                        </div>

<b>RPGs</b><br/>July has been a slow month for my RPG group.  We've been trying to get the last two sessions of <i>Tales from the Aether</i> (Planetary Romance using the Solar System (TSOY)) on the table, but instead we've mostly been playtesting <i>Agon</i>, which has been a blast.<br/><br/><b>Board Games</b><br/>Again, as slow month, managed to get together with friends to try out some light euro-y stuff, Fairy Tale, Reef Encounter, Havoc, Domaine.  Did some Wilderness War at the end of June, so I'll count that.  This weekend well see me loosed from my usual responsiblities though, so I'm hoping to pack in some more gaming.                        </div>

                            Got my weekly online Dogs game, plus we just started a f2f PtA game that will probably play twice a month (once f2f, once online, alternating).

                            OK, remember, you asked. <br/>
<br/>
RPGs: <br/>
 - IRC Hero Quest - The long running game that I'm Narrator for is between sessions and moving from Thursday nights to Monday nights. There are so many potential players that we're considering several strategies for MIRVing off games. I may run more than one. <br/>
 - IRC Hero Quest - The game I play in Run by Thomas Robertson is moving from Monday to Thursday. I missed out last night because my internet connection is buggy. Have to get that fixed. <br/>
 - IRC Hero Quest - I play in Fred's game on Teusday nights. <br/>
 - PBEM Hero Quest - I run a slow game set in Shadow World (like all of the above games). <br/>
 - PBEM Hero Quest - I run a game that's an update of a homebrew fantasy world that started about 20 years ago. It's become largely a wargame, with HQ if you can imagine. <br/>
 - PBEM Hero Quest - I play in a game set in Glorantha (near Delecti's turf). <br/>
 - Cons - Ran 6 HQ Sessions at Origins. Will be running more likely at GenCon. <br/>
 - PBEM FATE Mod - no, not my game that ran out months ago, but a game I play in run by Kirt "Loki" Dankmeyer that's like Starfire meets Stargate. <br/>
<br/>
 - I ran Inspectres FTF two weekends ago - one-shot. That same group looks like it's going to be playing Weapons of the Gods goign forward. Or maybe Over the Edge. We've developed character concepts for both. Probably once a week on weekends once Fall hits. Sporadic at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
 - I have another group of people that I've played with FTF for decades, and we might be gearing back up again. I'm thinking Hero Quest, TSOY, or a new thing I've been working on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Board Games:<br/>
 - 18GL this weekend - that's an 18XX railroad game based around the great lakes. First time playing that one (I play these about once a month), it's supposed to be the best of the series so far. <br/>
 - I also play random board games with this group occasionally. Pretty much everything you've ever heard of. And then a few. <br/>
 - We run a yearly convention at which we play games like 13 player extended board Advanced Civilization, and a real time zombie game I made up that involves using a few hundred of the zombie figures roaming about a mall. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wargames:<br/>
I've managed to exclude myself from the latest round of the Advanced Squad Leader "Red Barricades" scenario (and haven't played any SFB in some months now). <br/>
 - Instead I'm focusing on Warhammer 40K. Played a three way 3000 points a side battle last Saturday night (into Sunday morning). <br/>
 - I'm also running an ongoing Space Hulk campaign game with same guys. <br/>
 - Played Kingmaker with my 5-year old Alex on Saturday before going to Warhammer. Can't decide if that's a wargame or a boardgame...<br/>
 - He makes me play Feudal and other games with him, too. It's so hard to get me to play...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Computer:<br/>
 - Watching my wife play Sims 2. Not playing, watching her play. Metasimming. <br/>
 - Playing Harry Potter games for my son when he gets stuck in tough spots. Same with several online RPGs he plays. Like Adventure Quest. <br/>
 - Age of Empires (Sumerian Campaign)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other:<br/>
 - Paintball - OK, haven't played since May, but due to play again soon. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A usual, I'm sure that I'm forgetting something that I'm playing. It's hard to keep track of all of it. <br/>

                            I only played RPGs. I tried a session of Capes (inconclusive, must try again). I had a stab at Spione at Ron's special event in Berlin (may be better when you're not sitting in a former espionage agency's HQ from the fifties without AC during the hottest summer since weather recording). I played Dogs with Vincent (need to play more Dogs). I'll be going to play TSoY this sunday.<br/><br/><br/>For a month, that's a lot of gaming going on for me.                        </div>

<b>RPG:</b> I'm still GMing my weekly game of Etherscope, which seems to have devolved into some dark, machiavellian game at the moment. <br/><br/>I play in a weekly WFRP game, which is going fantastically, although we keep driving our GM to distraction by getting too involved in sideplots! <br/><br/>I also play in a bi-weekly game of Nobilis, online, which is fantastic, although all too often goes way over my head. It's a cool game though, and involves massively high level intrigues at the moment.<br/><br/>I'm also managing to sneak in the odd playtest of my new game, Six Bullets for Vengeance. I posted about it on the Forge recently. It went well, although has some tweaks that need ironing out.<br/><br/><b>Wargames:</b> My bank balance isn't thanking me for getting back into Warhammer. Sold a load of old minis off to replace them with some shiny new beastmen. So far, I've only won one game with them though. The dice hate me!                        </div>

                            Well, I just got back from vacation, which involved my usual vacation ritual with the boy: designing a one-on-one game that we can play over the course of the vacation, since we finally have enough time (on trains, over dinner, etc.) to get our gaming itch <i>really</i> scratched.  But vacation's done, so I'm back to my regular gaming schedule:<br/><br/><b>RPGs</b>, running:<br/><i>Gloria Mundi</i>: epic tragedy in ancient Rome.  We've been playing weekly for almost two and a half years, and we're well into the Decline part of Decline and Fall.  Watching the characters destroy themselves is so much fun.<br/><i>Bones of the Earth</i>: action-romance-intrigue-oriented Nobilis, with recurring themes of time travel and self-sacrifice.  This game included the best single session that I've ever run, which happened about a month ago, and I'm trying to do a writeup that makes sense that I can share with you guys.<br/><i>Dogs in the Spaceyard</i>: DitV-powered sci-fi game set in an Islamic space enclave, which is going to run until the end of summer as we're all grad students of various kinds and are meeting one morning a week until we go back to school.  We did character creation &amp; initiation last week which was ... interesting.  I'm going to post more about this at some point, particularly the differences from playing <i>Bitches</i> online.<br/><br/><b>RPGs</b>, playing:<br/><i>Bitches in the Vineyard</i>: DitV with the ladies!!  (And run by our own lovely Brand, who kicks butt.)  Unfortunately we are about to go on hiatus for three months, which is particularly sad as our characters were on the verge of killing each other.  Oops.<br/><i>Orpheus</i>: as the title suggests.  A friend of mine is running this bi-weekly and I haven't actually played yet, so I have no idea whether it's good or not.<br/><i>Fiat Justitia</i>: one-on-one Ars game which has been going about a year, and which I play with my boyfriend pretty much every day (if only for fifteen minutes or so).<br/><br/><b>Board Games</b>:<br/>I've been a little boardgamed out recently, but the gang came over for some <i>Blood Royal</i> (I think is what it's called?), which we decided was not a great game but nevertheless very very fun, particularly when slightly drunk.  <i>Tsuro</i>, of course, plus <i>Jenga, Monkey Arena,</i> and <i>Napoleon</i> (from Columbia Games; we just came back from Belgium and went to Waterloo and stuff, so the boy's been insisting  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>).<br/><br/><b>Video Games</b>:<br/>Oh, gosh ... <i>World of Warcraft</i>, of course, and I've been playing Sudoku on the computer kind of obsessively.  I'm also playing <i>Harvest Moon</i> (in various incarnations) and <i>Animal Crossing</i> for a paper I'm writing.  What else?  <i>Guitar Hero, Nintendogs, Combat Missions, Super Mario DS, Mario Kart</i>.  Next week I'm devoting to a replaying of <i>The Longest Journey</i> (and I'm taking NOTES this time!) and playing <i>Dreamfall</i>.<br/><br/>Fortunately I do this for a living, more or less, but once the semester starts I'm going to have to do more writing and research and less play - so I'm making play while the sun shines, so to speak.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

This month I have organized and played some indie-games demos at a Spanish national convention: PtA, Universalis, DitV, MLwM, InSpectres and Polaris. Very successful.<br/>
My somehow regular group is not working these months, but I managed to organize a nice try of Trollbabe, with one of my regular players and two people met at the convention.<br/>

                            I'm running a playtest of Galactic. I'm also running a Skype-based Dogs game for a couple guys who are  brand new to indie games, and that's going well. I expect the third session to be Total Rockitude. When we're done with Dogs, probably in the next town or two, one of them will run TSOY.<br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to playing a ton of new games at GenCon, but that's August, I suppose.                        </div>

<strong>RPGs:</strong><br/>I did one last playtest of One Night (which was still called CUP at that point) with my friends before Dexcon, and found I could run it with 5 players.<br/><br/>At Dexcon, I ran 3 games of One Night (I decided on the name change between the 2nd and 3rd sessions after a late night revision of the rules). I played Polaris, Carry (twice), Capes, Mortal Coil, PTA, First Quest, and Unistat, and Earthfall. Thatâ€™s 12 sessions of 9 different games and all but 2 of those sessions rocked, and the 2 that didnâ€™t were actually very educational. Dexcon rocks!<br/><br/>I played 1 session of Tripper, the campaign that my friends and I have been playing in for over 25 years. I didn't fall asleep during the game, someone else did. I call that a victory.<br/><br/>Tripper fell through for this Saturday (2 players can't make it), so I am running One Night, and there will be no sleeping at the table!<br/><br/><strong>Board games:</strong><br/>With playtesting One Night, going to Dexcon, and the demands of Real Life, there has been no time this month.

                            Oh yes indeed: Go to the <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/" rel="nofollow">Days of Wonder website</a>, create an account and you can log into the online games section. You will need to center the reference number that is stuck to your game rules to get free access. After that it costs, I think.                        </div>

                            Hells yes! It's available in both regular and Europe versions. You can also play the Queen's Necklace, Gang of Four and Fist of Dragon Stones. You can only start games if you have a code from any bought games, but you can join other people's games for free.                        </div>
