Maybe multiple sessions, maybe not.<br/><br/>Second, I'd like a system that could do Call of Cthulhu (pure not pulp).  <br/><br/>Third, to give you a better idea of my general tastes I am not a very huge fan of typical cinema horror.  Don't dig slasher flicks really because of their shallow-ness.  I would be very into doing a story in the same vein as "Seven".<br/><br/>Are all of those things impossible to find in a single game?  Should I just buy Zombie Cinema since Zombies at the forefront of my mind and try to scratch those other itches later on?  Ideally, I'd like to find a single RPG to do all of the above.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185701/#Comment_185701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T09:23:14+00:00" title="January  2, 2009  9:23AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All Flesh Must Be Eaten is the quintessential zombie game construction kit...<br/><br/>I don't even know what this means:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>Second, I'd like a system that could do Call of Cthulhu (pure not pulp).</blockquote>\nsince the source material is pulp to the power of Over Nine Thousand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185710/#Comment_185710" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T09:49:41+00:00" title="January  2, 2009  9:49AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course you should get Zombie Cinema.

I don't want investigators double-fisting pistols is really all I meant.  More true to Lovecraft's original works, not the stuff that came later from other Authors.  Also, All Flesh may be what I'm looking for but it's a bit limited.<br/><br/>Filip, I've tossed around InSpectres but I can't seem to force myself to check it out because no one seems to play it seriously and I have a hard time jumping on board for that very reason.  I've read Unspeakable and even that references the fact that your Cthulhu type game probably won't be as serious as Lovecraft's original material simply due to InSpectres over the top nature.<br/><br/>Eero, Zombie Cinema is on my list of games to buy(along with Solar System) but the fact that it's not exactly a roleplaying game has delayed me in purchasing it.  Also, I've been looking at Dead of Night and I read your AP on the Forge which sounded interesting.  However, I also saw someone mention it won't do Cthulhu and I also have a hard time envisioning it handling the more serious, gritty type of horror I'm after rather than the slasher/gore fest which is more common in the genre.  A zombie movie I would imagine would have much more combat than the typical Dead of Night game seems to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185718/#Comment_185718" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T11:27:00+00:00" title="January  2, 2009 11:27AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2009 11:27AM by Graham.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dead of Night is a quick, rules-light system that does horror very well. It can do any kind of horror story, really. It's good stuff. Some things about it are quite traditional: it's got a GM who, more or less, takes you through an adventure. Some things aren't traditional: you can spend Survival Points to narrate things.<br/><br/>Zombie Cinema does zombies. As you progress through the game, you move a pawn on the board, and the zombie take over the world. PCs die and it's cool. That's good too.<br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu is good for Purist Lovecraft stuff. In fact, it splits play into two modes: Purist and Pulp. It's much more traditional than the other games. It's pretty good and, I think, the best of the Gumshoe series.<br/><br/>If you want a <i>single</i> game to do all your horror stuff, I'd say Dead of Night.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185721/#Comment_185721" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T11:48:30+00:00" title="January  2, 2009 11:48AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak Arntson's <a href="http://zaknet.tripod.com/hmouse/games/chthonian.html" rel="nofollow">Chthonian</a> is worth a look.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185731/#Comment_185731" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T12:25:45+00:00" title="January  2, 2009 12:25PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/buystuff.html" rel="nofollow">Dread</a> (the one that uses Jenga) is great for what you're looking for.

I admittedly need to conduct some more solid research.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnypundit</cite><br/>Actually, I think it aligns pretty well with the original Lovecraftian, somewhat pulpish level of seriousness. I found it effective at emulating the overall tone and content of the source material pretty well, with the Sanity mechanics brilliantly tracing the descent of a character into an alienated monster, as opposed to their CoC's counterpart that largely boils down to psychological hit points.<br/><br/>Either way, I find it interesting that you are affected by the community's approach to the game that much. The fact that some people tend to treat it as a light game doesn't have much to do with the actual qualities of the rules. Anyway, I guess it's not possible to play any horror game effectively without a serious enough mindset anyway, regardless of the system used.</blockquote>\nThere's some interesting stuff there, particularly in the second paragraph that perhaps I should mull over.  I find actual play posts and people's opinions on here and The Forge highly influential personally and perhaps that's a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185746/#Comment_185746" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T13:59:58+00:00" title="January  2, 2009  1:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2009 2:00PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/buystuff.html" rel="nofollow">Dread</a>(the one that uses Jenga) is great for what you're looking for.
