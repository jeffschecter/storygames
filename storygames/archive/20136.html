It was also run (without me being there!) at a game day in NYC fairly recently, and I'm told that people had fun. <br/><br/>Jackson Tegu also wrote a game called Overture that is a sort-of-prequel to Group Date, and it just came out in the latest Indie Mixtape: <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146942/Indie-Mixtape-Volume-3-New-Hotness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146942/Indie-Mixtape-Volume-3-New-Hotness</a><br/><br/>It's about someone deciding what to do about their feelings for their neighbor (whom they can hear through the wall) and uses the same lust-optimism-empathy-doubt facets as Group Date.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444768/#Comment_444768" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-12T21:17:19+00:00" title="April 12, 2015  9:17PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's weird trying to figure out the source of fun, or perhaps to put it less subjectively, your own fun for an hour or so.  <br/><br/>It's funny that the most charming(interesting?) feature of play, the recombining of separate narratives to approach a singular one, was I'm assuming a kind of early surprise?  We form a thing out of already made things, thinking it'll do this thing, but it turns out it does this other thing, which might be better then the thing we wanted it to do.  <br/><br/>The combining of separate narratives into something somewhat singular, is a huge part of traditional role-playing.  <br/><br/>I have more to say on this, but I just want to say that I enjoyed Group Date and that it was the highlight of my brief convention-going experience.  <br/><br/>I hope you continue working on games.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
