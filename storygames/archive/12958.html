Bigger die = more risk.<br/></li><li>Whenever a player rolls a skill check, the risk die is rolled as well.<br/></li><li>If ( raw risk die roll &gt; raw skill check roll ) a crisis ensues.</li></ul>\n<b>Crisis</b><ul>\n<li>The character making the skill check is neutralized and may no longer participate in that skill challenge unless they are rescued.<br/></li><li>Any character who Aided Another on that check is neutralized as well.<br/></li><li>The skill challenge check may still be passed if the skill check roll was sufficient to beat the check DC.<br/></li><li>If the skill check was not passed, the non-neutralized characters may take ONE ROUND of skill rolls at +1 risk die size to salvage the skill challenge check.  Characters may opt out of this round to participate in a rescue attempt.</li></ul>\n<b>Rescue</b><ul>\n<li>Any non-neutralized character who did not attempt rescues get ONE ROUND of skill rolls at the original DC and risk die size, to rescue the neutralized characters.<br/></li><li>If crises are rolled on these rescue rolls, the roller and aiders are neutralized as well.<br/></li><li>If any neutralized characters are not rescued at the end of the rescue round, the DM rules on what is necessary to achieve rescue of them later.<br/></li><li>If all characters are neutralized, the party is at the DM's mercy.</li></ul>\nI think these are the probabilities of rolling a crisis:<br/><br/>d4 risk = 6/80 = 7.5%<br/>d6 risk = 15/120 = 12.5%<br/>d8 risk = 28/160 = 17.5%<br/>d10 risk = 45/200 = 22.5%<br/>d12 risk = 66/240 = 27.5%<br/><br/><b>Example:</b><br/><br/>The characters are in the middle of a skill challenge to journey across the plains before Ferax, Dragon Prince of Metal, catches them.  Suddenly, a new obstacle emerges -- a snow squall.  Howling winds turn everything blinding white.  Eyelashes grow icicles.  A vertical yard of snow accumulates in an hour.  <br/><br/>The party debates holing up for an extended rest, but in this skill challenge, an extended rest carries risks -- if they rest, they must save or accrue a challenge failure.  Karnak, the stalwart highlander fighter, will not hear of it!   He lashes the rest of his comrades to him and, navigating by the end of his nose, rolls Endurance to forge through the snow.  <br/><br/>The Squall obstacle assigns DC 15 and Risk d10 to Endurance. <br/><br/>Karnak's Endurance bonus is +8.  Karnak claims a +1 power bonus to the skill check for talking about how he's got his shield down in front of him and is using his at-will Tide of Iron power to snowplow the snow aside and leave a trail for his comrades.  So his total bonus is +9  <br/><br/>Karnak rolls 6 on his skill check, totaling 15 and beating the obstacle.<br/><br/>But his risk die is a 10.  Crisis!  Just as the skies clear, Karnak collapses, seemingly claimed by exhaustion and hypothermia. <br/><br/>Rescue round: Hiis the druid rolls Healing at the original DC of 15 and risk d10 to rescue Karnak.  Valok the warlord Aids Another with some fire magic to warm the tea.  But Hiis rolls a 1 on his skill check and 7 on his risk d10!  <br/><br/>Karnak is still out, and Hiis and Valok slump over, their lips blue as well.  It turns out that Karnak was not just hypothermic -- in the squall, he was possessed by a cruel spirit of predatory cold, and it has invited two of its friends to the feast of heat!<br/><br/>Now, the remaining characters must either choose to press on through the challenge without the help of their friends, or choose to take the DM's offer of a full extended rest in order to get rid of the cold spirits and regain the help of their friends.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
