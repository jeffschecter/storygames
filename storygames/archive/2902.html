That is, the idea is that you're trying to find the bad-guys, and destroy them, and your abilities as a player are being tested in the process. It's a Lovecraftian Dungeon Crawl, because that's all anybody knew back then. Note that COC is a massive failure at this, as well, because your odds of succeeding are nil. Worse, there's usually no player tactics allowed in the vast majority of the situations. If the GM calls for a climbing roll, and you fail, fall, and die, that's hardly something that the player could have prevented through good tactical play (which leads to the rope-climbing problem, which I can address elsewhere).<br/><br/>This is all covered in Bryan Bankhead's rants on this precise subject over at The Forge (three long essays).</blockquote>\nBy the way, here's the links for Brian's rants (from late 2003).  I had replies on the first and third.  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=8459.0" rel="nofollow"><b>Drifting to R'lyeh:Facing the Problems with Call of Cthulhu</b></a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=8482.0" rel="nofollow"><b>Cthulhu's Clues: Why failure is not an option</b></a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=10197.0" rel="nofollow"><b>Hot Lead and Hypocrisy: a rant on guns in Call of Cthulhu</b></a><br/><br/>Frankly, I think Brian shot himself in the foot from his first post, in that he constructed an argument based on GNS as to why Call of Cthulhu in practice is so unpopular -- that everyone hates it.  To anyone who is familiar with the larger picture of gaming, this is blatantly wrong.  CoC is enormously popular.  In 1998, 8% of all gamers were playing it monthly, and it was the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a> among all RPGs -- this from a game 17 years old with no external market force.  <br/><br/>I agree with Mike that the original design was more concentrated on flavorful challenge -- i.e. gamism. I'd also agree that it is high lethality -- i.e. PCs will die often due to die rolls.  What I'm puzzled by is the idea that death in general and random death specifically mean that gamism is a failure.  <br/><br/>For example, huge numbers of video games are built where the chance of succeeding is virtually nil.  They are deliberately designed to kill you off, and if you do well then they just try harder and harder to kill you off.  Yet people enjoy them.  People will often enjoy them even if there is no point score displayed -- they'll play to see how far they get or how many opponents they can take out before they go.  <br/><br/>From my view, Call of Cthulhu as designed is a strategic, mystery-based game.  It appeals to people who are interested in more strategic, investigative thinking as opposed to ticky, rule-based tactics.  In a well-designed scenario, you are automatically provided with enough information to get into real trouble and be killed.  Good rolls and a clever approach (especially in where you go and what preparations you make) will give you more information to help you survive.  Still, you should expect casualties regardless.  i.e. This is more like poker than chess.  <br/><br/>There were and are many problems in it as originally published: Handling of longer time scales, the whiff factor, and critically the art of scenario design.  However, the lethality is part of the appeal of Call of Cthulhu, not a flaw.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65823/#Comment_65823" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T14:25:00+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  2:25PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that the lethality could be considered a flaw because of this part of your quote:<br/><br/>"If the GM calls for a climbing roll, and you fail, fall, and die, that's hardly something that the player could have prevented through good tactical play"<br/><br/>Mechanics that wipe out the player's achievements without any chance of player input are bad for Gamist play.

The game is quite explicit that players should get a warning, albeit not necessarily much of one, and if they proceed they do so at risk.  That's part of the appeal, playing smart so as to avoid instakill situations.  Mike's quote does not reflect the game as written IMO, it reflects the game as filtered through a whole load of later advice which is not present in the actual book.<br/><br/>But to be honest, Bryan's rants for me fall foul of a classic error.  If a game has has survived for years and has seen tons of play and is much loved by many, then the odds are it is a good game.  The fact that one may not oneself have had those results with it simply suggests it is not a good game for you, not that it is per se a bad game.  <br/><br/>The alternative is silly, if a game (D&amp;D, CoC, whatever) has years of widespread play behind it then it seems to me the simplest hypothesis is that it is a good game which for many delivers fun play.  Any other hypothesis seems to me to fall foul of Occam's razor.  We end up with hypotheses that people aren't really enjoying themselves when they think they are, which is a far more extraordinary hypothesis than the idea that a few people just don't get the game.<br/><br/>CoC, like D&amp;D or for that matter Vampire, is a conspicuously successful rpg.  I think if one wants to understand it, one can't just ignore that fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65828/#Comment_65828" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T14:56:17+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  2:56PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2007 2:59PM by jenskot.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am extremely biased.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've worked for Chaosium. I have worked on illustration and assisted with layout for several of their monograph modules. One of my best friends is writing Secrets of Peru and has contributed to many, many other modules. I've also run demo games officially sponsored by Chaosium at cons all over the East coast. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that I have played Call of Cthulhu with well over 300 different people.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first question would be what edition of Call of Cthulhu are we talking about? And are we counting supplements like the Investigator's Handbook? Are we also counting official modules? I consider many of the official modules a core part of the game as they help teach you how to play. There are 6 editions of the main rule book. But they are similar enough that many players an play with each other regardless if they own the 3rd or 6th edition. And many players don't think the rule books are important and only buy modules and background books.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the popularity of the game, I think it has very little to do with the rules. The majority of the players, authors, and Keepers I have spoken to enjoy the rules because they are so easy to ignore. Also, the highest selling books are CoC Secrets of books followed by their modules. Both of which contain very little rules. The Secrets of books are mostly flavor. Most people I have played with (in the 300s) play the game because of the setting, source material, and ease of play. My only point is that I think you can have immensely popular games that have absolutely nothing to do with the rules. I would say most of the players I have played with learn the rules by reading the modules, not the rule book or word of mouth. I know that many of their authors haven't read the rule books cover to cover.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have pretty strong opinions about the system itself. Definitely leaning on the negative side. But I can see other people points as well. Although I am very biased.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65883/#Comment_65883" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T06:52:10+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  6:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a potentially very interesting discussion. I'm particularly interested in people's ideas about what function combat serves (or ought to serve) in a CoC game. It seems to be different from its role in most other games, AFAICS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to observe, though that there is more than one game out there being played as CoC. In particular, there is a version out there that never fails to bemuse me. It appears to be based on the fun of killing off as many characters as possible, as spectacularly as possible. The players strive to keep their characters alive as long as they can, but death is actually the payoff, as far as they are concerned. I read this as a sort of strange adaptation to trying to run CoC like it was D&amp;D;, and then finding a way to enjoy the result. But I may be wrong...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless,this mode of play is definitely not compatible with the investigative horror game I like to run!<br/>\n<br/>\njenskot, maybe if you were to explain what differences between the editions make you keen to know which one we're discussing, that might be more illuminating than just trying to pick one for the sake of argument? I'm not aware of any important differences myself, but I haven't been paying much attention lately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65884/#Comment_65884" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T06:56:22+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  6:56AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jenskot hit hte nail on the head.  I would never consider BRP a "good system."  What was popular was Lovecraft and that particular brand of horror.  It has spawned all sorts of merchandising and sustains a gaming subculture.  It's not because rolling percentile dice was brilliant.<br><br>CoC is not gamist.  Nor is it's predesessor in GUMSHOE.  Death and instanity is not there to make a statement about how your characters' succeed, rather to really make a game about how your character's fail.  The game is ABOUT going insane.  It reflects HPL's fiction rather well in that your character is not really expected to get to the end in one piece and really becomes more like the zombie addage about running faster that the guy behind you.<br><br>Now designers and players over the years confused this intent.  I like GUMSHOE and I think it fits the genre well, but in using it for CoC specifically I think one misses the point of CoC - to lose.  I think CoC is all about "does your character see the end of the world."  Otherwise it becomes Hellboy - "sure we see it and we're there to stop it."  CoC is a sort of nihilist play.  It's not about finding clues and stopping the cultists.  <br><br>I can not stress this enough:  <i>CoC is about the gotchas and the character's dealing with their compatriots dying and going insane. </i> Look at the text.  I am in the 2001 20th Anniversary Edition.  The lionshare of the book is about setting - lists of spells (and how they drive you insane), lists of critters (and how they kill you or drive you insane), lists of books (and...well you get it).  Out of a 320 page book the rules go from pg 51-88 (37 pages).  Of that 10 are about killing one another and 11 are about going mad. <br><br>Now I agree that when put into the hands of 15 year olds and people innundated by dungeon crawls it can easily revert to a gamist perspective - a lot of games can because they were all pretty much written in the same manner back then.  It was a matter of momentum.  But I would say that if that's the case then they weren't reading carefully enough or weren't savvy enough to understand the goals here.<br><br>As many of us have, I ran CoC for years and years.  It was mostly a series of one shots to fill in holes for other campaigns or if I ran a campiagn it was a ensemble cast with a stable to draw new PCs from.<br><br>Now could CoC have been done better mechanically to drive it's themes forward?  No doubt!  In fact I wonder if I could hack Heroes Banner to create a CoC game... hmmmm.<br><br>*gets to rereading HB....*                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65886/#Comment_65886" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T09:17:36+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  9:17AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think he read the wrong game.

It is the shingle I hung out to recruit people, and the notional token that we used to justify free-forming around. We used the sanity mechanic. We pretended to use the rest of the rules, and we used the combat rules when <i>everything was already fucked up</i> and we knew we should die here. If you were shooting anybody except mook cultists, you were probably fucked.<br/><br/>CoC, as I have experienced it, is a convenient excuse for celebrating the pulp horror genre, in flavors ranging from the ludicrous (Scooby Doo) to the cheesy (<i>Blood Brothers</i> is an old reliable) to the two-fisted (<i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i>) to the genteel (<i>Golden Dawn</i>) to the technothriller (<i>Grace Under Pressure</i>)...<br/><br/>It is even less susceptible to analysis as a single game with a defined system than "D&amp;D".

You see, I think what alot of GMs do is think like a human(GM) when playing the NPCs. In CoC, there are monsters. Monsters are not human. Thus, they don't employ tactics, they dont always kill the character outright. Example of play: 4 characters vs Dark Young(they weren't supposed to attack the dark young but oh well). The attacked with guns and shotguns or whatever. These all do 1HP damage and Dark Youngs have what? 60HPs? In any case, the Dark Young could easily kill all of them in 4-5 rounds. Except it didn't. It grabed one of them and started draining strength from him while meekly attacking the rest of the crew(I mean they were missing 70% of their shots and even when they hit, it did 1HP damage. They were nuisances.)<br/>The Dark Young was then called back, it flung the investigator against a wall and dissapeared. The flung character lost some strength, almost died from hitting the wall but survived with some broken arms/legs. The others were also injured.<br/>That's an example of how you can play a monster ''encounter''. If I played CoC like the posted rant suggested I would have killed all of them in 2 rounds flat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65927/#Comment_65927" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T16:28:29+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  4:28PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2007 4:29PM by jhkim.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just wrapped up an 9-month Call of Cthulhu campaign that I GMed, and I'm playing in another one.  I have had a number of posts about them on my LiveJournal, marked by a <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/tag/call+of+cthulhu" rel="nofollow"><b>'call of cthulhu' LJ tag</b></a>.  <br/><br/>"The  Man Who Shot Joseph Curwen" is an essay that appears in <a href="http://e23.sjgames.com/item.html?id=HITE001" rel="nofollow"><b>Dubious Shards</b></a>.  It analyzes the games of Call of Cthulhu and among other points, draws a parallel between CoC PCs and Tom Doniphan in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance".  Both sacrifice themselves for the greater good, without being rewarded for their pains with fame, fortune, higher level, magic items, or so forth.  He further makes the claim that this almost uniquely puts it apart from the "adolescent power fantasies" of most RPGs into stories of "moral adults".  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I can not stress this enough:<i>CoC is about the gotchas and the character's dealing with their compatriots dying and going insane.</i>Look at the text.  I am in the 2001 20th Anniversary Edition.  The lionshare of the book is about setting - lists of spells (and how they drive you insane), lists of critters (and how they kill you or drive you insane), lists of books (and...well you get it).  Out of a 320 page book the rules go from pg 51-88 (37 pages).  Of that 10 are about killing one another and 11 are about going mad.</blockquote>\nOne clarification here...  Both Mike Holmes and I referred to the <i>original</i> design of CoC, which I took to mean first edition in 1981.  Still, I think a lot of this still shows through in later editions.  <br/><br/>The later editions and much of the surrounding material do give more mixed signals, as the state of role-playing changed but the CoC mechanics changed very little.  Even so, I hardly think that a big list of monsters and how they can kill you is evidence of lack of gamist ethic.  <br/><br/>If we accept Hite's essay, then the challenge of seeing how much you can save at the cost of your life and/or sanity itself makes a heroic narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65928/#Comment_65928" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T16:46:40+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  4:46PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>the role of combat in CoC (or, more generally, in a game of Lovecraftian horror)?

And that the overall point is that any monster you can kill with a gun is irrelevant, on account of it being simply the side-effect of something much bigger and darker, something that you can't really stop with human effort.

This discussion is not about "this is how I play CoC" rather what form of play the books display through rules and intent.  THIS IS THE POINT of the discussion.  Not that we play the game differently rather we often run the game differently than intended.  That intention can be gleaned through study of the text, weight of subjects within, and play of the game as written.  The problem here is that there is a lot of people approaching this game from different directions.<br/><br/>I don't think it's useless to talk about what the text says to us.  I think it IS important to talk about where our heads were when we began to play this game.  Are you playing it as an exploration of the source material?  Are you comein at it from a dungeon crawling experience?  Did your group not care about the beasties and the dreamlands and focus in cultists and clues?

It gives PCs a sense of power over the cultists and a feel of mortality when they are shot but ultimately it seesm to me to be designed to lure the players into shooting critters which they should know won't go down by bullets alone.  i have always felt that it fits that thematic component and have seen it work out this way in several games I've run and played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65948/#Comment_65948" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T21:49:04+00:00" title="April 28, 2007  9:49PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave &amp; John,<br/><br/>I didn't read that essay but I can certainly see the direction it could go from John's comments on it.

Ken's argument is that the central tragedy of the Western ("barbarians can only be defeated with the gun, but all who take up the gun are barbarians") extends equally to Lovecraftian horror (in my version, "the alien can only be defeated by those who understand it, but all who truly understand it become alien"). This I think corresponds to your "things you realize you didn't want to know".<br/><br/>I agree with you that insanity is central to the game. I always felt that killing PCs was a necessarily evil. Necessary both to lend the game the feeling of danger and to maintain the illusion that play was set in the real world, which I count very important. But it lacked style. I was always much happier when PCs went insane instead.<br/><br/>If people really want to focus this thread on the narrow issue of whether the original edition of CoC can or should be read as primarily supporting gamist play, I will respect that, and may even contribute. But I find it hard to care about the answer. The question of the ways in which CoC fails to serve its purpose, what that purpose is or ought to be, and how a better game of investigative Lovecraftian horror might be constructed, that I can care about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65964/#Comment_65964" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T04:21:51+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  4:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it amusing that I asked Mark W whether I was essentially stating his position correctly, and so far two people have popped up to tell us that his position is wrong even before he's had a chance to assent or differ!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike,\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">In Lovecraft's stories, guns and explosives are not infrequently the way that the monsters get taken down.</div>\n</blockquote>\nOK, it certainly happens to a degree in several stories.

It's not about finding clues and stopping the cultists. </blockquote>\nGUMSHOE says nothing about the success or failure of the PCs.

Combat <i>using the rules</i>, against supernatural opponents, was a foregone conclusion. Characters would lose. Therefore, it was only allowed to happen when players had already "lost".

That's a little different. So on the one hand, a way for characters to go out with a bang, rather than a whimper. On the other, sometimes a way to actually resolve the story more in the PCs' favour.<br/><br/>A question: you say that only the former kind was "by the rules". But the ways you describe it being different in the second example are not rules fudges. They're changes in the behaviour or vulnerabilities of monsters/NPCs. This seems something a little different to me from ignoring the combat system. Am I reading you right?

Or what?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>rules were largely used only as they served the goal of emulation</blockquote> The question here is what you felt you were emulating, I guess. FWIW, I've tended to think that CoC, rather than emulating a HPL story per se, instead emulates the world in which his stories are set. Others may disagree, of course. One difference is that you would expect a lot more death of central characters by violent means in the latter, compared to the former, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65981/#Comment_65981" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T08:40:32+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  8:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>That's interesting, but I'm not sure I understand.

The PCs will use firearms (maybe even on a gamist level) because they feel that technology and guns are the most effective and that they have the most control over the situation (and costs them the least sanity).  But against the critters it's a primrose path.  They most assuredly can't harm most of the alien beasties with guns.  I can say that my players' characters lose more sanity in this fashion - "As you empty the clip into the oozing mass you find that it quivers from the impact but otherwise engulfs the rounds.  In fact you're pretty certain that as the floodlights panning through compound pass over the transluscent thing you can see your rounds floating harmlessly in it's viscous innards.

(Your two are different from his two, though)<br/><br/>In your first type (shooting up minions), combat serves as a way for the players to remove those who would oppose their actions, albeit perhaps at some cost to their sanity and health.<br/><br/>But in the second (shooting at aliens), there is no "combat" as such. The only purpose of these encounters, combat-wise, is to show the PCs the nature of the alien, and by doing so, bring them closer to the sharp end of the CoC Catch-22.<br/><br/>If that's right, it sounds as though you think CoC might be better served by having simple mook rules for some combats, plus "it doesn't work, lose SAN" rules for the rest. Though if such a difference were codified in the rules, perhaps players would be less likely to try shooting at aliens? I dunno.

I don't think, as a traditional, outta the way, system goes, CoC really does it badly - it just doesn't have any bells and whistles.  <br/><br/>Larry has a point in that I would probably want to see CoC play in action (aside from my own) to better estimate what CoC does for many people.  Basically I want to see where they are taking games, what rules they are using, and where it seems like they are having the most fun.

We're not emulating a Lovecraftian story, only the world in which those stories are set. As such, the only real function the combat system has is to convey the feel of the world HPL describes. And to do that, you don't need to do much. You need to produce results that are not obviously out of whack with the world we know (i.e. that doesn't contradict the setting presenting itself as "real", which I think is essential to this and many other schools of horror). Humans need to be fairly frail. It probably shouldn't be too fancy or complicated. That's about it. From this perspective, BRP's combat system is a reasonable fit for the game.<br/><br/>The question I wonder about is whether the combat system can contribute more than that, and if so, what.<br/><br/>As regards your question (where they are taking games, what rules they are using) , I am currently using a FATE-based system, which I think has several advantages for investigative horror, albeit with quite a lot of changes needed compared to say SotC. The most obvious of these is the combat system. This can easily be tweaked to make it more lethal (and the FATE wiki has some good suggestions) but the need to think about what is really needed/useful is a big concern to me at the moment. I currently change the combat system about every play session. Fortunately, my players aren't getting into many fights, and have yet to notice.<br/><br/>On the one hand, danger is good. On the other, killing PCs is not that good, IMO. On the one hand, meaningful choices make combat scenes more interesting. But on the other hand, tactical combat hardly suits the genre. I read a very interesting post from TonyLB over on the Forge once where he described running combat (in Shadowrun, I think) where obtaining information was problematic and costly. I think that seems like an avenue worth pursuing in horror gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66234/#Comment_66234" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T15:23:38+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  3:23PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who's never played CoC before, I have a question for you experienced players.<br/><br/>Does "My PC loses a point of SAN" translate into "I feel my character's descent into insanity"?

If you get enough explosives, well over half of the monsters are vulnerable to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66250/#Comment_66250" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T18:20:10+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  6:20PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wondering...

I'd be pretty unimpressed with a GM who just decided that in his game Deep Ones were immune to bullets, unless there was a good explanation. Not only would that contradict the canon, it doesn't make sense in terms of the logic of Lovecraft's world.

The big difference is that they do not go into much detail in the rules over "hit points equals this kind of wound."  <br/><br/>So for those interested here is how SANITY in CoC works.  If someone has the book and I make an error please whisper me and I will edit my post.\n<ul>\n<li>You have a pool of points that ranges 0 to 99 although a more standard high for PCs is 50-60.</li>\n<li>When you are faced with something disturbing or gruesome you roll % and must get under your SANITY score (on occasion the score may he halves or something to make it more difficult).</li>\n<li>If you succeed the book suggests that you probably rationalized the event and down-played it in your mind into something it isn't.  This is important because it reflects the idea that its the TRUTH of a thing that unhinges us.</li>\n<li>If you fail there is a severity that dictates how many dice you roll and subtract a total from your current SANITY score.</li>\n<li><i>now this is the point that I am going from memory</i> When you reach certain benchmarks (1/2, 1/4 ?) you and the GM determine how the SANITY loss is manifest and lists a detailed number of ways someone can go insane.  Put that in context with the event and continue play acting out one's new "bent."  If you get to zero your'e done and become an NPC, getting locked up, becoming one of the villains or laying down some further clues through self mutilation, mad scribblings, etc. (remember the earier scenes in Dark City where John Hurt visits the cop he's replacing?)</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66463/#Comment_66463" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T15:57:10+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  3:57PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another spin-off thread explains <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2927" rel="nofollow">what I prefer in the way of sanity mechanics</a>.

But the use of world-emulation rather prevents this from being mandated by the game mechanics. Instead we have to have human fragility and the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">thread</span>threat of death, it seems. I'm not entirely willing to leave world emulation for the realms of story creation, in this context, however. I value immersion and suspension of disbelief too much.

I think part of the art of running CoC well is to maintain the illusion of lethality, to have the players convinced that the Keeper is prepared to TPK every last one of them at the drop of a hat, if warranted. If a Keeper can preserve this tension, this fear, while at the same time ensuring that incidents of PC death do not undermine the exploration of other sacrifices the PCs are making, then that Keeper is delivering. <br/><br/>This can be a challenge, particularly if the Keeper is open rolling in front of the players. However, it is possible to do so. That said, there are times when the Keeper is obliged to go for the jugular. The DG scenario Convergence is oft cited as particularly lethal, and rightly so. I almost TPKed a DG Cell while running it and have no regrets. But if every operation or investigation results in 70% fatalities/long-term insanity I think there will be massive problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66517/#Comment_66517" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T04:56:46+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  4:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/><br/>You could say the same thing about hitpoints, though.</blockquote>\nI don't think so. I think SAN loss should be regarded as a metaphysical assault on a PC's wellbeing, happiness and security. Significant SAN depletion should pervert a PC, derail his live, cut him off from those he loves, values and respects.<br/><br/>One aspect of play my players often refer to when introducing new players to our ongoing DG campaign is that we should, as players, have massive sympathy for any CoC PC. Particularly a new PC about to be exposed to the Mythos. It's been remarked that it would be better for a fresh investigator to die in a car crash on the way to an investigation, than to arrive safely and to be sucked in, to be exposed. <br/><br/>It's axiomatic that the Mythos contaminates, pollutes, renders worthless. it's how we translate SAN loss and exposure to the Mythos into ruining our PC's lives that gives CoC its unique power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66521/#Comment_66521" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T05:22:10+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  5:22AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2007 5:27AM by D-503.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think creating illusions at the player level is ever a great idea to be honest, it can really backfire.<br/><br/>More saliently, I think the possibility of pointless death is intrinsic to Cthulhu.  I think it is a feature, not a bug, that PCs may die when they were in no way explicitly sacrificing themselves.  This is because CoC is existentialist, you may at any moment die, what matters is how you live with that knowledge.<br/><br/>Making PC deaths necessarily meaningful undermines a core concept of the game, that our lives are in fact devoid of meaning save that we give them, that the meaning comes from how we live them and not how they end.  <br/><br/>IMO preserving characters from death where it isn't part of a player chosen sacrifice fundamentally undermines the concept of the game, the story the game is designed to help you tell.  Moreover, I don't think it reflects the underlying point of the stories.<br/><br/>At any moment we may die, even as I type this a blood vessel could burst in my brain and it would be as if I never was.  HPL's fiction is a dramatisation of existentialism, a realisation that the universe is indifferent to us and our concerns.  CoC helps manifest this by making the game system, the rules of the game universe, equally indifferent.  I think if you change that you lose the essence of what HPL was seeking to achieve.<br/><br/>Edit:  I had about three hours sleep last night due to having to work really late, and am a bit concerned my posts may end up being brusquer than I intend as a result.  If so, sorry about that, and I'm going to duck out for now until I'm rested up.<br/><br/>Cool thread, I'd love to see a new take on CoC reflecting Delirium's and others ideas.  There's room for many interpretations, CoC already exists, new takes would only add to the potential fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66524/#Comment_66524" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T05:44:54+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  5:44AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite><br/>More saliently, I think the possibility of pointless death is intrinsic to Cthulhu. </blockquote>\nI agree, death should occur, and death need not necessarily have any particular meaning. However, I think a lot of the online discussion of CoC presents a style of play in which the majority characters have an extremely short play life. I'm thinking of some descriptions of Masks of Nyarlathotep in which players burn through 4 or 5 PCs over the course of the campaign. Now, that's fair enough, but I don't think that level of PC attrition should be regarded as the default and desired level of CoC as a whole. It's a question of balance - I think narrative continuity and an exploration of the poisonous effect of the Mythos on the lives of PCs can be hindered if any given PC has a 50+% likelihood of not surviving an operation. <br/><br/>There are, I think, other considerations, other avenues to be explored, although I do think that the current rules set provides an eminently suitable vehicle for doing so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66527/#Comment_66527" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T06:15:26+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  6:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Delirium</cite><br/>Now, that's fair enough, but I don't think that level of PC attrition should be regarded as the default and desired level of CoC as a whole.

This idea that because Lovecraft describes an uncaring universe, the game mechanics should somehow reflect that, is often touted, but seldom fully justified. At its most extreme, I've seen it used to mandate the use of dice in game mechanics because "Lovecraft describes a random universe". This I think is nonsense, though I'm not trying to put those words in your mouth.<br/><br/>To a degree, it depends how much we are interested in recreating Lovecraftian stories, and how much simulating the world they describe. As soon as you get interested in the former, the whole idea of random meaningless death vanishes, IMO. Lovecraft may be kidding us that things are just happening in his stories for no reason, but obviously, the opposite is the case: it's all there for a purpose (his).<br/><br/>Putting that aside and returning to the "world of HPL" game, it's not clear to me that what I described as happening is actually contrary to the spirit of the stories. (Though mentioning Dogs was probably a mistake.) I don't think anyone is going to argue that if what <i>happens in the game</i> is that PCs never die unless they sacrifice themselves, the result is somehow un-Lovecraftian. Correct me if I'm wrong there. Similarly, we don't actively <i>need</i> PCs to die for no reason in game to have a Lovecraftian atmosphere. What is being objected to is a rule that says it can't happen. Not because of its effects in play, but because of its effect on the mind of the players. How are we to make them feel as though their characters are inhabiting an uncaring universe, if on the other hand we tell them that they can't die unless they wish to? How are they supposed to feel their character's fear of dying when they know it's unjustified?<br/><br/>If anyone disagrees with this so far, let me know. But it seems to me that this is the real issue. Not that "the possibility of pointless death is intrinsic to Cthulhu", but that historically and habitually, we have used this possibility to communicate the nature of Lovecraft's world. Do we have to do that?<br/><br/>I'm not saying I have an answer to this question right now. But I don't think we should dismiss the idea that there could be one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66543/#Comment_66543" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T07:42:15+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  7:42AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I think there are as you identify two parallel approaches here, recreating the world depicted by HPL and recreating the stories of HPL.  My interest is more in the former to be honest, which may be why my approach differs in some respects.<br/><br/>One thing though, the possibility of pointless death is being seen as a problem in this thread I think, but I'm not sure it is, not for me anyway.<br/><br/>Any conflict where a life is at stake should be dramatic, per se, on rpg.net there used to be an example used of a PC dying in a pointless fight with a security guard.  If the fight is pointless, why are people risking their lives over it?  I think the protection PCs enjoy from pointless deaths in many games can actually lessen drama, by making it possible to take entering into lethal combat lightly and as something routine.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm digressing, I agree with everything in Dave's post, but my fun lies in participating in the world depicted rather than emulating the fiction, in the fiction every death does of course have meaning whereas within the fictional world that is not the case.<br/><br/>The utility of the possibility of undramatic death as a dramatic tool is probably way off topic for this thread, so I'll leave that for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66546/#Comment_66546" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T08:05:16+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  8:05AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, PCs are completely disposbale in my CoC games.

I like rich, detailed characters with plenty of background, and my players like playing them. The last thing I want is for one of them to die for no special reason. But I won't keep them alive if it destroys suspension of disbelief. That would be even worse.<br/><br/>Max, I think you have some good points. As I said in the "moments" thread, I think *something* has to be stake in a combat. Something serious. But the "security guard" example sounds like a failure of imagination, in some ways. No, I don't want a PC to die fighting a security guard. But I don't want fear of dying to be the only reason not to go around shooting them. Why does it always have to be death? Why not sanity, humanity or social ability? <br/><br/>Another way to look at it, is the old "don't roll dice unless both outcomes are interesting" rule. Somehow this seems to get forgotten in combat resolution (and I'm as guilty as anyone). If neither "PC kills guard" nor "Guard kills PC" is interesting, what are we rolling for?<br/><br/>I think everyone has some kind of PC death that's unacceptable in their game. Crossing the road on the way to the store? Falling off their roof trying to adjust their TV aerial? Allergic reaction to a peanut or a bee sting?

That said, I take it as read (possibly because I have a good group) that nobody will be in fights to the deaths that don't matter because frankly that's insane.  If a fight is potentially to the death, I already know it matters, and thus have no need of rules for plot immunity.<br/><br/>I have lots of thoughts on this, but am off on a work conference for a few days.  I'll try to post in a new thread about it, essentially for me (and I do mean for me, not for everyone) rules-enforced immunity from harm (usually death, but the same would apply for me for other consequences) damages drama by removing the element of real risk.  Also, frankly if the death of a PC isn't interesting then I really wonder why the PC's life is being risked, that death being uninteresting suggests to me the conflict did not merit risking a life for.<br/><br/>Essentially, many rpgs make killing a casual matter, removing the risk of PC harm (and few games with death protection give other replacement highly negative consequences in place of death, though some do and more so in the indie area) can increase the casualness of the player's decision to have their PC kill another sentient - the absence of risk to the PC (death or otherwise) can mean they simply kill because it's easier than other options.<br/><br/>This goes for me into assumptions in most rpgs about the disposability of human life which is not something I like in my games, but as I say it's off topic.  I'll post on it in a few days when I'm not shattered.  Part of it is many games, particularly trad ones, make it functionally easier to kill opposing NPCs than to do anything else with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66567/#Comment_66567" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T10:01:11+00:00" title="May  2, 2007 10:01AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>I think everyone has some kind of PC death that's unacceptable in their game.

If a PC dies, chances are overwhelming that it'll be in the line of duty, so to speak.  I think the more practical complaint is that the deaths may be unheroic, like dying from a lucky shot from a nameless cultist or monster.  <br/><br/>Of the three on-screen deaths in my last CoC campaign, the first two were both in the pretty much random death category.  The PCs encountered a monster that they hadn't suspected, and one of them ended up dying.  The first was as they encountered a monster in the astral plane, and it struck at them as they were running away.  The second was when they went down into clay pits, and then tried to use dynamite against a creature that arose there -- and the dynamite destroyed the creature but also killed one of them.  This was all letting the dice fall as they would.  The last was on the final session and was basically a self-sacrifice, and I sort of fudged it -- not so that he'd survive, but so that he would have a chance of success before dying.  (We rewound a bit when he realized that his original attempted action was a clear mistake, and let him come up with a different plan.)  <br/><br/>All three worked excellently with our group. <br/><br/>But yeah, three deaths over an 8-month campaign isn't all that frequent.  Combats were rare for this crew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66571/#Comment_66571" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T10:14:23+00:00" title="May  2, 2007 10:14AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand that many, many gamers are squeamish about character death and normally my PCs only die in a stroy relavent fashion but not in CoC.  In my annual CoC game my players feel most sorry for the one or two sod that survive to the end and don't go insane.<br/><br/>There is total buy in here.  These particular players trust me and they get it.  They understand that (for us) this is not a game about mysteries or heroism or glory.  It's about how fucked up characters live get even more fucked up.  It's all about the process and never about the end result.  They await cool moments of sheer creepiness and points where they have to walk away from the table for a break from the tension.  <br/><br/>One year I was a little off my mark and the game was so-so (the premise was a little too alien) but they all recall that year plainly as the year I inserted a big 'ol yellow sign in the middle layer of icing for that night's desert.

I wouldn't call that random at all, even if there was a chance they might survive. Still, it's a minor point.<br/><br/>Eruditus (and others of the "disposable PC" view),<br/><br/> I would guess you nonetheless have some criteria about what you're trying to achieve. I gather that you set up the situation, and let the dice fall where they may. Fine. But what's your aim in setting up the situation? On what basis do you call for dice rolls? What's your overall approach? What makes a session good or bad for you? Other than moments of creepiness, that is. We all love those - it's the chief aim of my play too, despite our different attitudes to PC death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66686/#Comment_66686" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T07:00:53+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  7:00AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2007 7:07AM by eruditus.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think these are all good questions for nearly any game (answers no doubt differ game to game).<br/><br/><b>But what's your aim in setting up the situation? </b><br/>I aim to accomplish two things in a session: hard choices and escalating horror.  <br/><br/>I will list four or five hard choices that the PCs are likely to encounter, mostly in the beginning of the game.  This accomplishes two things.  It allows the players to feel like they have some control over the situation and to establish moment of realization that they sometimes made their own beds, so to speak.  Other hard choices are made extemporaneously.<br/><br/>Escalating horror means that the adventure is a string of events designed to inspire SANITY checks.  It is done within the context of a storyline and starts small and builds to more dangerous checks.  I start with mundane events (screams, animals behaving oddly, murders, interviews with the insane, etc), go to more supernatural oddness (hints of critters in the periphery, cultist ceremoneis, scraps of mythos research, odd insects or unexplained marks on a body) then it culminates to the blatant supernaturals for those that have thus survived to experience (cultists with supernatural powers, mythos tomes, minion critters, sighting of old ones in mirrors, etc).<br/><br/><b>On what basis do you call for dice rolls? </b><br/>My criteria for anyone rolling dice is this: <br/>- each player generally only rolls once or twice per scene and narration happens based on that roll.<br/>- players declare their intentions based on the situation.  I either create conflict and have them roll or narrate according to their intentions.<br/>- if conflict arises then I set the consequences for failure (sometimes secretly but more often openly) read the dice and narrate based on the whole picture.<br/><br/>When people start chasing the PCs, swinging Khopesh or firing Tommy guns at the characters i will usually reveal wounds and/or deaths in dramatic moments.  I will set a scene so that they realize what's happening when the action lulls or they realize a character is slowed or dead when it critical that they get away fast. <br/><br/><b>What's your overall approach? </b><br/>I frame most everything as if we were watching a movie.  I think about things as storyboards and frames, stills to start the action out in and then the game itself and the players interactions get the film rolling.<br/><br/>Almost everything is on the table.  I have a few secrets I keep from the players but almost everything is laid out for them to experience to build suspense.  They are privy to cultist's conversations, kidnappings or a flashbacks to how someone went bonkers.<br/><br/><b>What makes a session good or bad for you? </b><br/>Smiles, shudders, gesticulating.  Are we having fun?  Are their lulls where we're just looking at one another?  Is the story clicking?  Are they talking to one another in character?  When it's over are they excited to play the next one?  Do they recall great moments in the game?  Do they talk about decisions they could have made and lament the fallen?<br/><br/>Maybe I will run some CoC soon and do a blow-by-blow AP.<br/>- Don<br/><br/>EDIT: I'd like to mention that this is not how I run games as much nowadays in that I have been playing things like WGP, tMW, Dogs, Contenders and Ganakagok.

No I plan on a few of the hard choices but they don't necessarily know what they are going to be (other than I will use clues from what we all know about the characters - flags and all that).<br/><br/><i>An example of a scene and rolls:</i><br/><b>God</b>(Me): "You enter the small flat of the missing professor.  It certainly looks lived in and a bit cluttered for such a small set of rooms.  There is a kitchenette, a bathroom and a main room dominated by a bed.  Papers litter the flat and the room is only lit by the small window in the main room.  There is a rolltop desk against one wall with a small lamp on the table that casts a yellow light over the area when you turn it on."<br/><b>Players</b>: We're going to look around and trying to be quiet. (each decides to look at a basic general area - one at the bed, one at the desk, one in the bathroom).  <br/><b>God</b>: As you look at the rolltop desk you're sifting through the papers and books and an envelop slips out onto the floor.  Neither of you notice it as you're intent on the tasks at hand.  (Looks at the player searching the bed) Make a SANITY check (He fails and loses 2 SANITY.  I ask the person behind him to make a Notice check and ask what's more important to them - noticing your friend's reaction to something he sees or noticing the envelop on the ground).<br/><b>Player</b>: No doubt the envelop is important but I don't want the other guy freaking out and waking the neighbors so I'll roll for him.  <br/><b>God</b>: If you get a critical success you'll see both. (The player rolls and succeeds)  You see your friend stumble backward and taking in a big gasp of air...<br/><b>Player</b>: uh, I try to clasp my hand over his mouth.<br/><b>God</b>: Excellent.  As you do, you look over his shoulder.  The two of you see that sifting through the covers revealed a severed finger amidst splotches of blood.  (to the second player) Make a SANITY check with a 15% bonus since you know something is going on. (He barely succeeds).<br/><b>Player</b>: Ok, I say "Holy Shit" and remove my hand from my buddy once I see he's calmed down and stopped struggling.<br/><b>God</b>: (To the PC in the bathroom) Your not finding anything of interest.  It's a pretty small room.  There is a steady drip in the tub and the room is surprisingly bright. The tub and sink are cold to the touch.  Since you all just got back from dinner you have to take a piss.<br/><b>Player</b>: Well, no time like the present.<br/><b>God</b>: You lift the toilet lid and see that there is no water in the bowl.  The bottom is glistening, ruddy and stained brown.<br/><b>Player</b>: (pensively) uh, do I think something might be stopping up the toilet?<br/><b>God</b>: It's a good guess, unless there is no water coming in from outside or the tank.<br/><b>Player</b>: But the tub is dripping so the plumbing is working...*sigh* I roll up my sleeves ... (everyone groans).<br/><b>God</b>: You hear his proclamation in the other room, "Holy Shit."<br/><b>Player</b>: Uh, thank god, I run out to see what's going on.<br/><b>God</b>: You're a coroner and the finger makes you wince but other than that you're fine.<br/><b>Player</b>: I take out my hankerchief and pick up the finger to inspect it.<br/><b>God</b>: Your science and forensics skills tell you that it's probably a day old and there is a deep impression around the base of the finger near the incision.<br/><b>Player</b>: Can I figure out how it was cut off?<br/><b>God</b>: Sure, make a Forensics roll or 1/2 you're Sceince. (he fails the roll) Nah, you'd need to take a closer look at your lab.  It's pretty clean, not chewed.  The amount of blood indicates little splatter.<br/><b>Player</b>: So might we conclude that the professor wasn't struggling too much?<br/><b>God</b>: If it's the professor's finger (wry grin) yeah, that would be fair to say.<br/><b>Players</b>: Is there anything around that would give us an idea what that ring might have been?<br/><b>God</b>: What sort of thing would you expect to find regarding the ring?<br/><b>Players</b>: How about a picture or something of the professor?<br/><b>God</b>: You take the picture off the wall and see that the professor stands around several others wearing a ring.  The image is too small to see clearly but under a magnifying glass it may be more apparent.  You recognize the dean in the picture.  He wears a similar ring.<br/><b>Players</b>: Ah, well we can take the picture and the finger to the science building on campus or go visit the dean.<br/><b>God</b>: It's night-time, no doubt everything is closed.<br/><b>Players</b>: Thats why I picked up the crowbar from the G-man's car trunk earlier.<br/><b>God</b>: Okay.  Anything else?<br/><b>Players</b>: We head out.  We'll discuss our destination on the way.<br/><b>God</b>: The next morning we see the envelope, having been kicked under the bed and a handful of shoes pacing about the room.  One pair stops at the bed and a pair of chubby fingers peels the envelope from the bloody floor.  Inspecter LeFevre sniffs at the blood.  He uses a pocket knife to open the envelop and slide out the paper inside.  He puts on his reading glasses and reads aloud (if I didn't actually write the letter then I will tell the players the basic gist).<br/><b>Players</b>: Crap, we forgot the letter!  Gosh, how are we going to get that info from LeFevre?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66810/#Comment_66810" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T15:51:30+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  3:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thanks for taking the trouble to write that out, Don, I really appreciate it.<br/><br/>I don't think you have particularly more or fewer rolls in a scene than I would.<br/><br/>The two things that are different are (i) asking the player whether he wants his PC to roll to notice the envelope on the ground, and (ii) the cut scene at the end. Unusual, but effective. And I see how this rather authorial/directorial mode of play fits well with the PCs being more disposable.<br/><br/>I think my players would play along with this kind of game, but some of them definitely like not knowing things that their character also doesn't know. They say it makes it easier to imagine things from their POV. I don't think they would object so much to knowing that LeFevre found the letter, but I think knowing the content of the letter, and then trying to figure out how their characters might find out that information, would strike them as a bit of a charade.<br/><br/>Still diff'rent strokes, and all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson" title="Olle Jonsson"><img alt="Olle Jonsson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://olle.1av10.nu/pics/site/face.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson">Olle Jonsson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66875/#Comment_66875" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T07:27:53+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  7:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I actually read this far in this thread, wow, you've been wordy.
