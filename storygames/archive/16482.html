For reasons that are probably suspiciously larp-y this is way better than just getting up and signalling that your character has departed. Partially this may be because it allows for some hidden knowledge among those you leave behind. It seems like a lot of important stuff happens between the first departure and the second, and the lack of transparency for those few moments seems to work well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377272/#Comment_377272" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T06:13:44+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  6:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played it multiple times, and I disagree with the advice in your second post.

I guess we did know how to argue back then;)<br/><br/>Looking back on playing Until We Sink on four occasions, and how it has helped me grow as a player and a designer; I would still say that it was a ground-breaking game. and honestly, just as fresh as it was four years ago. I wouldn't hesitate to put it in my Top Ten Influential RPG list. <br/><br/>Re: leaving the veranda; I think I have played all of my sessions in the same person's apartment. And if memory serves me, the person getting up would just want into another room (the apartment has an open layout) and either listen in on the remaining convo, or not. Or use the bathroom, or fix a drink or whatever. It just never came up as an issue for me.<br/><br/>I see the first person leaving the veranda as being a big point in the scene. It's a sign that "hey, the main part of this scene is over" or "we've been rolling with these scene for awhile. And the unsaid message from the first person to get up is "let's wrap this up". Sometimes it takes awhile for the second person to get up (and thus for the scene to end). But occasionally, the second person gets up almost immediately. It's a fascinating mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377285/#Comment_377285" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T08:16:47+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  8:16AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That old thread is really funny. <br/><br/>And of historical interest, really.

I mostly remember the early character interactions and bickering, which were quite enjoyable. I played this pampered, gossipy retired woman, and she was fun to inhabit as she buttered up some characters and sniped at others.<br/><br/>Despite the really odd premise, which sounded pretty wacky when i first heard of it, the game felt really naturalistic, like we were portraying real human beings and not archetypes, adventurers, pulp heroes, etc, in a way that few games have done.

We had some early accusations (regarding the trigger for the first scene) but, lacking enough knowledge, I felt I was fumbling for a bit, unsure of my motivation or what I could tell was true. Once we got a ways in, some things started developing. It was clear the natives had a secret, some form of worship, and that it was related to the island sinking. This created some solid meat for us to hook into and (for me at least) things started rolling quite nicely after that.<br/><br/>Regarding the leaving. Since we played such a casual game, and possibly because there were drinks in the other room, I found getting up and going to the kitchen (from the living room we were playing it) to be very satisfying. It didn't feel like the kind of game where I needed to know everything, so being absent was just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377340/#Comment_377340" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T13:03:05+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  1:03PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny, Sean, I think that early aimlessness is a result of our play style that emphasizes an intense desire to root out conflict and revel in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_377350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377350/#Comment_377350" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T14:07:31+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  2:07PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe that early aimlessness is part of the mode this kind of game operates in; it has to set itself in the players, before really coming to life.

For those of you who've played it more than once, how long do your games last, on average. (I think the game we played on Tuesday night went for about an hour and half, plus some time at the end to reflect on what'd happened.)<br/><br/>My favourite part of the game is that an entire day happens off-screen between each evening's conversation. I found that gap inspired me to flesh out my character's life, and it created two reversals I found interesting:<br/><br/>- During Night 2, my sullen teenager had started to enjoy bantering with the backpacker and obviously wanted to get stoned with him. But at the start of Night 3, I found myself acting coldly towards him. Something had obviously happened between us during that day, but I had no idea what.<br/><br/>- My dad and I ended up exchanging some pretty hurtful words at the end of one evening. I decided that my teenager would start the next evening happy and considerate towards my dad - obviously we'd had a good talk during the intervening hours and sorted some of our issues out.<br/><br/>Another thing that became obvious as we were playing it: we treated the situation a little bit like an analogy for rising sea levels (a situation that island nations like Kiribati are <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/Rising-sea-levels-swallowing-Kiribati/tabid/1160/articleID/246548/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">already experiencing</a>).<br/><br/>And a good point about the social divide between islanders and guests: as we played, I became aware of a real hostility from the two characters who were native to the island towards towards their <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">slightly</span> obnoxious guests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_377408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377408/#Comment_377408" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T23:14:58+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 11:14PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2012 11:15PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Pardon me.

The secrets were the way of non-mechanical and GM-free play; a modern design of a very different type.<br/><br/>Magnus made his part of our co-project a genre-game on explorers discovering a hidden valley, called <i>The Forgotten Valley</i>. That game had some of the elements you find in <i>Until We Sink</i>, but the method was hugely refined and simplified in the later game. We eventually gave up on our co-project, but the secrets we were searching for, were unlocked by Magnus when he went on to design <i>Until We Sink</i>. <br/><br/>I'm very grateful to him for doing that. It has opened up whole new venues of design to us, and new venues of methodical game-play. <br/><br/>I were astounded by the simplicity of the final principle. To make a game so simple, and then to have that game deliver such nuanced drama, was mind-blowing!

(lack of sleep making me forget her name...SavageHominid's girlfriend).<br/><br/>Anyhoo...<br/><br/>It was really, really fun. By limiting the character interaction to a particular time and place each day, as they are gathered on the veranda, makes it feel like we're playing out a scene from an art theater play. The curtains rise and the lights go on to reveal to the audience a piece of a story.<br/><br/>It was also interesting to see how the revealed Event cards sometimes match up perfectly with things that were brought up in play on the previous day. I was playing the hotel owner, Lon Fata'ai, and had revealed on the previous day that there were the ruins of an old temple on the island, and it was kinda dangerous to go in there, trying not to really explain anything like any good tight-lipped, cranky old man would. Sure enough, the next event was the newspaper clipping about the death 20 years prior, which seemed to fuel EVERYONE's suspicions about what the significance of the temple might be. It was AWESOME.<br/><br/>It was only at the end where things started to drag out just a bit, as we had three unanswered questions that no one was really willing to own up to (the wet radio, the dead fisherman, and the death 20 years ago). But I think that's because none of us really tried the whole pointing at someone else, and saying "Hey, I saw you doing..." or "Why did I see you over at such-and-such place?" Not sure if it was because we weren't really used to that bit of the rules, or if maybe we kinda forgot it as the game went on, but I think it would have really pushed the scenario a bit more. It needs to be a big, bolded bullet point in the rules: Tell other players what you saw them doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Twelves" title="Twelves"><img alt="Twelves" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Twelves">Twelves</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377826/#Comment_377826" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T12:07:53+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 12:07PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2012 12:58PM by Twelves.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>I've played it multiple times, and I disagree with the advice in your second post. Being clear about leaving the scene = yes. Leaving the room = no, no, no. I just walk past some imaginary, arbitrary "out of game" line and then sit quietly in a far corner of the room, listening. If you leave the room for real, then it's like if you left the room during a game of<i>Fiasco</i>: people will need to fill you in on what happened while you were away,<b>because you need to know</b>(as a player).<br/>The game's not a "larp", in the sense that synchronous play and partial player knowledge aren't part of the format here: even with full transparency, it's already hard enough to tie all of the loose ends into a "story" in the end.</blockquote>\nI agree; leave the scene but stay in ear-shot.<br/><br/>I also agree that it can be hard to find traction in those first few scenes. It's important to establish relationships, the same way one would at the beginning of Fiasco, and even identify your character's wants and needs.<br/><br/>This was a game that I used to introduce a lot of improvisers to gaming, and it worked really well since it had such a light structure. I then moved on to Fiasco, and then stepping it up to other narrative games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite><br/>I was playing the hotel owner, Lon Fata'ai, and had revealed on the previous day that there were the ruins of an old temple on the island, and it was kinda dangerous to go in there </blockquote>\nI think it's important to introduce other details, like "the old temple." This gives characters a lot more to discuss and grounds the characters more than just floating about on the open-ended mysteries.<br/><br/>In the game I played with Sean, Steve, and Jason, Jason (the hotel manager) mentioned the sacred rituals of the native dwellers and how those explained for being seen late at night, or the dead bird, etc. I believe it was Sean's character who then developed a great interest in joining in the rituals, which lead to tension between his character and Jason's. The fact that their god required a blood sacrifice lead to a very ominous finale on the boat, with Steve (the mostly silent native employee), saying, simply, "Napapui'i needs blood" and staring at Sean and me, suggesting unfinished business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
