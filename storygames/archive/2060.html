<p>I'm sitting here, reading over all the geek-oriented threads of late, and just out of whim I headed over to dictionary.com for a little grounding.  I do that sometimes.  What caught my eye was an American Heritage Dictionary definition;</p>
<p><em>A person who is single-minded or accomplished in scientific or technical pursuits but is felt to be socially inept.</em></p>
<p>Of course, in the case of the gamer geek, I'd imagine replacing "scientific or technical pursuits" with "arcane game knowlege".</p>
<p>Which was funny and illuminating.  See, from years of context, I'd always disassociated the socially inept from the geek.  I was internally using a definition where Geek = Arcane &amp; Trivial Acomplishments, with lack o' social skills being a coincidental side-order.   But now I see that some folks (probably most folks) define a geek by their lack of social skills.  Heh.  Didn't know that.</p>
<p>So, back in another thread, when I said I was happy with gaming being geeky, I certainly did not mean that I was happy with gaming being about social ineptness.  I did mean that I am totally happy with the amount of time I invest in the hobby.</p>
<p>And now that I know the difference between how I'd been using "geek" and how others might use the word, I imagine that this may just be a little bit of a culprit for miscommunication in those other threads.  But that's just me guessing.</p>

                            Someone really needs to fund some ethnographic research into how the holy trinity ("geek," "nerd" and "dork") are defined in America, both in terms of how they're used by people who don't make much of a distinction and by people who do.<br/><br/>Until we have some such hard data, this conversation <i>almost</i> is not worth having. This fact did not stop me from writing an <a href="http://www.gibberish.com/gazebo/articles/geek3.html" rel="nofollow">essay</a> long ago, however.

I really liked your essay. And I think think the different groups you reference (SAPs, geeks and nerds) are all repped here -- without knowing it -- and that's causing some of the stress.<br/>

                            I can't speak for anyone else, but I've always held the opinion that there's always going to be someone who's going to think you're a geek, nerd, whatever, no matter what you do, what you say, or how you try to come off across.   The only difference is WHICH group will consider you it.  (which is why I've always felt that those titles are a point of view thing,even if it's 'supposed' to be something else.)<br><br>Maybe this is part of the problem I've had in the other thread.   I might have just assumed that everyone else didn't take the opinions of others as a fact, and been oblivious that someone might think -i- thought it was a fact.<br><br>Who knows.

                            But it is the origin of the term. That is, "geek" meant a circus performer who would bite the heads off of chickens. It's come to mean what it means because of the implied ostracization of a person with such an odd talent. I mean just how do you relate to that?<br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to imagine that somebody could think of the term geek without thinking of the notion of somebody socially inept. I believe that the term began to be used to replace "nerd" in the 80's. Which was the term formerly used to refer to precisely what the dictionary reference above refers to. For some reason nerd became passe, and geek took over.<br/>
<br/>
C.F also "Pencil Necked-Geek"<br/>
<br/>
An assumption about "geekiness" is that it goes along with physically small or obese individuals. The idea being that these people were often outcast simply because of their body image (caused by either real or imagined taunts). Unable to compete with individuals more in the normal range of body size for the attention of the opposite sex (or, again, feeling that way), the notion is that they compensate for the lack of self-esteem by finding some technical area in which to excel.<br/>
<br/>
The enthusiasm for this technical field, then, is seen by those who don't need such as pathetic. Geeky.<br/>
<br/>
Dork means simply socially inept for whatever reason, though, yeah, it's often conflated with geekishness or nerdiness. Basically somebody who is unable to express themselves well because of their self-consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some speculations of late that the phenomenon is somewhat caused or actually synonymous with Asperger's Syndrom and other similar high functioning forms of autism. I've known two "gamers" who have been diagnosed with Aspergers, and most "Gamers" seem to exhibit at least some of the symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
As we move into a more technologically dependent world, the specialized technical knowledges of some "geeks," most obviously computer skills, have made these individuals capable of bringing down rather good salaries, which suddenly propells them into relative sexual attractiveness that they've never had before. This helps self-esteem, and "geeks" are slowly losing some of the self-esteem problems that they had.<br/>
<br/>
So there's this secondary effect where there is a populace who has technical knowledge, and previously lacked self-esteem, but who now do not. These people think of themselves as geeks, but they no longer exhibit the key ingredient, the lack of self-confidence. Instead they cling to the term so that they can indicate that they are somebody with that sort of now valuable specialized technical knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
This is phenomenologically associated with this particular period in history. That is, the rise of computers and the internet is what's caused this shift. Note, too, that many "geeks" hold onto the association as such, becuase a common form of defense mechanism against the self-consciousness caused by being ostracized is to assume that "everybody else" is simply bad. "I'm OK, you're not OK" to use the morphology from the pop psych book. Like, "If I'm a geek, so be it...you just don't see my value...my mom said so."<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that, because of Bill Gates, lo' the geeks are validated in this belief. But it doesn't make the psychological methodology any more healthy.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I am to some extent merely speaking of my own experience with the phenomenon. Meaning that in High School I felt ostracized, and resorted to RPGs are my form of technical knowledge (and computers). I was a pretty weak case, in that I tended to merely be cripplingly shy, instead of one of the uber-geeks who manage to actually maneuver through life looking as though they are not bothered by the fact that they are thought of by others as being inferior (didn't hurt that I was only a "geek" and not a "pencil-necked geek"). And I've grow out of it as most geeks do - it's not just "geek chic" but that experience is a good teacher. You learn not to be geeky, to have real self-confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, for a primer on what my life was like in the 80s, see the show "Freaks and Geeks" which speaks directly to all of this, including the RPG play, and does so with absolutely starkly frightening authenticity.<br/>

<p>I kinda just wanted to nail down my own particular (mis)interpretation of 'geek', poll to see if anyone else was doing the same, and then maybe try again to see what Matt's been trying to communicate this week.

                            I think the key is:<br/>
<br/>
There are several words ('geek', 'nerd' and so on)<br/>
<br/>
They mean several things to different people. (And will continue to do so.)<br/>
<br/>
Matching the specific words to the different definitions is not as important as recognizing there are different definitions at play.<br/>
<br/>
And not only are there different defintions at play (definitions people self-identify with, defintions people <i>don't</i> want to identify with) that people are using. We're talking past each other in part beause there's an assumption about the language <i>should</i> mean -- but that's not actually working out.<br/>

                            Erik,<br><br>Because you're getting into dictionary definitions, and that IS the fucking definition:
<blockquote><cite>m-w.com:</cite><br>Main Entry: geek<br>Pronunciation: 'gEk<br>Function: noun<br>Etymology: probably from English dialect geek, geck fool, from Low German geck, from Middle Low German<br>1 : a carnival performer often billed as a wild man whose act usually includes biting the head off a live chicken or snake<br>2 : a person often of an intellectual bent who is disliked<br>3 : an enthusiast or expert especially in a technological field or activity <br>- geekÂ·dom /'gEk-d&amp;m/ noun<br>- geekÂ·iÂ·ness noun<br>- geeky /'gE-kE/ adjective<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>
As in, our modern usage of "geek" is just a metaphor for somebody who's weird like a circus performer. I actually visualize a guy biting the head off a chicken when the word "geek" gets thrown around enough. Like, "Check out that fucking weirdo!" It's quite a put-down. I guess at some point we reclaimed it as a badge of honor, like the "niggas" and the "queers."<br><br>Regarding "geek pride," I have some half-formed thoughts about Nietzsche's "slave morality" brewing. I'm a little incredulous that anyone's still carrying around grudges from adolescence.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Haven't we learned yet that people don't agree on definitions?</p>
<p>If you want to talk about something contentious, just <em>provide your own definition</em> and say, "Talk about <em>this thing,</em> and for the sake of everyone's sanity, use <em>this word</em> in this thread. Don't talk about whether <em>thing</em> and <em>word</em> match up in your own head. Nobody cares."</p>

And I've grow out of it as most geeks do - it's not just "geek chic" but that experience is a good teacher. You learn not to be geeky, to have real self-confidence.</blockquote>
So, to compare to my own experiences...   I went to high school at a private prep school where I, too, was shy and unpopular, as well as being non-white.  I worked on plays with my best friend and did a few RPGs and excelled in physics and math and computers, but we were pretty much shunned by the prep-school crowd.  <br><br>Where I blossomed was in college at U of Chicago, where there was a vibrant gaming club and lots of imaginative people.  I did a lot more theater than in high school, and I did a lot more gaming.  I excelled in physics, just as in high school, and I got along well with my crowd of physics homies.  I don't see that I learned anything to not be geeky -- any more than I learned to not be Korean.  <br><br>So looking back on it now, I have no regrets about who I was in high school.  I have regrets that the people of my school were assholes.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Mike's got a lot of important points, up there. I think there's a little confusion between "social ineptness" and "social esteem" (or self-confidence,) though. Although the results for both are the same, there's a big difference between people who have problems making friends because of shyness, avoidant behavior, or lack of self-esteem, on the one hand, and people who have problems making friends because they miss social cues (because of borderline autistic traits.)</p>
<p>I wouldn't bring this up, except that I think when we say something is "geeky," we're talking about interests that are usually associated with the borderline autistic group than with the low self-esteem group. Science fiction is not inherently geeky, but there is a stereotypical "sci-fi geek", obsessed with science fiction details, who fails to communicate well because all his conversations are really monologues about his obsession. The true sci-fi geek treats all of the surface details of their favorite books, movies or shows as equally important and wants to discuss <em>all</em> of them, in depth, while simultaneously not grasping them on the abstract or thematic level. It's all hours and hours of arguments about warp technology or elven history.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something about this in the other threads, because I thought people were kind of circling around an important concept without approaching it. The general public, as several people have already noted, like science fiction and fantasy just fine, so it's not the science fiction or fantasy elements in RPGs that they consider "geeky". It's something else. It's the way "roleplaying geeks" latch onto the superficial details and pile one on top of the other... and it's the way they take these details from everything they have ever enjoyed and bundle them together. So yeah, both lasersharking and spell and equipment lists are symptoms of this kind of geekiness. Ordinary people who might like RPGs don't play them because they would have to become just as obsessively well-versed in those subjects as the geeks they would play with.</p>
<p>As a side note, this is what I took Matt Snyder's rant about coolness to mean, too. Not that people actually think they will be cool if they buy game X, but that they will be ostracized unless they like all the canonical "cool things". That may be a complete misinterpretation on my part, but at least it explained to me his seemingly random mention of Jungle Speed -- because, yeah, I've seen people bring up Jungle Speed in threads that had nothing to do with that game, with a feeling of "I am mentioning Jungle Speed here not because it's relevant to the topic, but because I think it's cool, and I want you to think it's cool, too. And I will shun you unless you like it." I see a similar thing with mentions of Firefly, anime, and numerous other things, any one of which would seem perfectly normal in threads where they were relevant, but which get dragged into any discussion where "coolness" is somehow in question.</p>
<p>I'm not immune. I deliberately avoid posting very much, because I don't want to unknowingly drift into monologues about my own "cool obsessions". And I'm proceeding very carefully with my game designs, because I know I may unknowingly pile on details in my games to make them "awesome". But the paradox of awesomeness is: jamming together as many different things as possible into your game does not actually broaden its appeal, it narrows it. So, proceed with caution. You can create monstrous chimera, but think of them as guilty pleasures. Don't be surprised when you attract only a small audience.</p>

<p>Check this out.  John Kim said this in a nearby thread:</p>
<p><strong><em>"She has a huge tattoo of an elf on her back, which I think qualifies her as geeky."</em></strong></p>
<p>And I totally agree!  That is such a geeky thing to do!  At the same time, I say that with a grin on my face and a positive tone in my voice.  It's geeky and it's awesome.</p>
<p>I define that as geeky.  John defines that as geeky.  Obviously neither of us are saying that his friend is socially inept.  We're not bringing that part of the definition into play when we judge an elf tattoo as geeky.</p>
<p>I don't think that our use of the term is any more or less valid than the dictionary definition.  I'm also not in any way shape or form surprised that there's more than one functional use of the term.  What did surprise me is that there might be people <em>here</em> using geeky as a synonym for socially disfunctional.  Please note that I'm not judging that use, I just wasn't expecting it.  It was a lightbulb over my head that I thought might shed some light on why I wasn't understanding Matt.</p>

Well, I've learned a lot of things since high school.  And yes, I have more self-esteem now.  However, I don't think that's a significant factor in the story, because I don't believe the primary factor for my ostracism was a lack of social skills on my part.  I'm not sure it even hits the top ten.  My ostracism was because I didn't fit in.  I know that talking back articulately to the jocks who had a problem with me didn't earn me a place within the prep school order.  I was interested in the wrong topics; I did the wrong activities; and I was the wrong race.  <br><br>I have no feeling whatsoever that if I went back with my current social skills (say if my adult mind were to jump back into my teenage body) that I would somehow be accepted, except perhaps by hiding who I am.                        </br></br></div>

Agreed.<br><br>When you take a term that others identify with, that is a part of their identity, and use it as a pejorative, you have to expect at least some of those people to be upset.<br><br>Reading these threads, I find myself really wishing they hadn't started with using "geek" as short-hand for what was really being talked about. As an added confusion, "what was really being talked about" is at least two not necessarily related things, as far as I've noticed: games without sci-fi, fantasy or similar elements, and games with a small social-footprint. If people talked about that and dropped the whole "geek" thing, there'd be a lot less grief.

                            Eric the thing I was trying to convey is that the term only came into use in this context at all in the 1980s, and at that point it was a harsh term. Before that it meant what Larry is talking about (going back to around 1928 - prior to that it meant more like what we think of it as meaning now apparently: <a href="http://www.wordorigins.org/wordorg.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wordorigins.org/wordorg.htm</a>) In fact I recall when people began using he term that when one was called a geek, a typical geeky response was, "Pshaw, I've never bitten the head off of anything!"<br/>
<br/>
The meaning that it attained at that point was very distinct and mean - you wouldn't have called anyone geeky to their face unless you never wanted to have any chance of being their friend again. At the time, as I recall, there was no worse epithet you could throw at somebody. Asshole and motherfucker notwithstanding.<br/>
<br/>
I think that, in fact, the use of Geek this way can be directly attributed to Fred Blassie when he released the song "pencil neck geek" in 1977. Fred may have, in fact, been refering quite correctly to it's pre 1928 meaning. It's ironic that, in fact, the song is meant to be an ironic satire of machismo. Here's a link to the lyrics: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/p/pencilneckgeek.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/p/pencilneckgeek.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
It's only recently, say since 2000, that the term has moved in the direction that you're using it that I know of. Put another way, I've heard it used like you're using it, but rarely. Almost everyone I know outside yourself would use it the way that I'm expecting.<br/>
<br/>
Now, interestingly, you're from the coast, and I'm from the flyover. Which means that we here get terminological drift about ten years out. For instance I went to see my cousins in California when I was young, and my cousin described somebody as "Buff" and I had no idea what they were talking about. So it may well have been that you folks had a drift to "geeky" having less or no negative connotation earlier.<br/>
<br/>
But, again, reference Freaks and Geeks. Note the disproportionate amount of populace that plays RPGs per capita in my neck of the woods. Consider the aging populace of gamers.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't surprise me to know that the majority of RPG players think of the term as I do, rather than as you do. Which is not to say that you're definition is wrong - I think that the idea of something being linguistically "correct" is absurd, frankly. I'm just trying to give you some perspective, and confirm your thought above that it may be that most people are using it this way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John, were you ever called a geek as an insult? I was. Graduated from High School in 87, for reference. I can recall acutally using it in one circumstance on another kid, and feeling distinctly awful about doing so after the fact.<br/>

                            I recall being called a bookworm on more than one occassion. Not so much the term geek, but bookworm for certain. Then again i was the only student that i recall who walked from class to class reading and read in study hall as well as in the lunch room, was on the debate team, and worked in the library as well so while i was upset the few times it was used, it was also a source of pride. <br>
Never mind in 7th grde Reading Class when I read over 200 books during the year, sometimes 4 or 5 a week so perhaps it was deserved.<br>
Separate issue, not related directly to the topics, but tangital and inline with talking about who we were then, what we were called, how and why it affected us and the social groups we self and are associated with.<br>

I never implied that merely identifying as a geek suggests any such thing. I'm referring to certain statements where the reason that being a geek is great apparently boils down to you've got an identity that puts you above those nasty "normal" people.                        </br></br></div>

                            Eric, I like this thread. I hope that you do get something new out of re-reading, because I think so far you're pretty reasonably representing what I was getting at.<br><br>You'll note in those threads that I soon avoided using the word geek and started using the term "sub-culture" and specifically meant it as an indicator of what we generally understand (at least I do) as "gamers" and gamer culture. To spell it out: I do not identify with "gamers." I do not have an interest in the sub-culture, the in-jokes, the auto-reactions about what's cool. Generally, I find I'm really less and less excited about things that I recognize gamers getting very excited about. I probably did all that at one time. I no longer do. I don't find, for example, the elf tatoo thing appealing at all. It does nothing for me either way. I don't think collecting dice is worth my time. I'm never excited about the news of any of my formerly favorite RPGs being re-released in new edition (or whatever Teh Awesome release). And so on.<br><br>These things are not having outgrown gaming in any kind of "when you you stop playing with toys" kind of way. These are, merely, changing tastes over  years of time. The "ugly" side is that this change is also having observed repeated dysfuntional behaviors among game groups that I find needless and wasteful. I do not believe any and all members of the sub-culture have such dysfunctions. Simultaneously, I find these to be common <i>enough</i> that the problems are too widespread to maintain my interest.<br><br>Meanwhile, I maintain an interest in the actual activity of role-playing games, of playing the games themselves. I design them. I enjoy playing them. I enjoy playing them with people who eagerly communicate not only about the game itself but about their social lives. I no longer wish to play with people <i>because they are gamers</i>. I wish to play with people because they are interesting people who demonstrate two things: A common interest in a particular game and the ability to share their personality and social events with me in a happy, healthy way. Not flawlessly, not in touchy-feely group therapy, but just good neighborly common sense.<br><br>I have found over the last 3-4 years that, too often, members who express a pretty strong affinity for the gaming sub-culture do not meet one of two things I just explained. This, I hasten to add, is not universal. I have many happy, healthy friends who do indeed identify themselves eagerly as members of the sub-community (i.e. who let their geek flag fly). I enjoy playing games with them, despite no longer having any desire to join the hobby on their level of enthusiasm.<br><br>And, so, that's that. I hope to be able to find, out there, additional people who share similar outlooks to mine. Right now, I feel very much on the border between cultures, despite that being a really silly, inocuous thing (it's nothing like, as John Kim expressed, being ignored because of one's race). Because I do have a handful of individuals whom I identify as in a like position to my own, and who have expressed sympathy with my views, particularly in the last week, I remain hopeful about it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

But I was in on the "Infamous Five" at The Forge. Which covered all of this stuff in spades without any of the problems of understanding (though there were some similar questions brought up). Matt and I are working off an implicit understanding of that material, and a reading of it might help anyone who's looking into this stuff. I'm assuming that you've read it, Eric?<br/>

<p>Larry,</p>
<p>It's true.  You have no idea what I'm getting at.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that there are people who grew out of using geek as a pejorative.  I'm saying that there are people who use the work in a way that is not a put down.  I still get called a geek.  But without hostility or threat.  And I smile, nod, and agree.  When I identify as a geek, I'm not dispariging people that aren't geeky.  Because my social circle uses the word differently than yours does.  And I'm also saying that I was surprised that there are educated people who <em>still</em> use it as a pejorative.</p>
<p>Yes.  Seriously.</p>

I mean, if I say that being an asshole is a bad thing, and that I want to reduce the number of people who are assholes, is what I'm proposing a bad thing?<br/>

<p>Awesome.  I think I really get what you're getting at now.  I'm about to jet out of here for the evening, and possibly for a couple days, but I've got a couple questions for you... which upon consideration may already be answered in the other threads.  Once I re-read I'll catch back up to you, and probably start a new thread.</p>

<p>No, sir.  I'm saying that it's been so long since I've heard that particular term as a pejorative from anyone who wasn't out of touch that I was surprised to hear it that way.  I'm not judging the use, just using my surprise to illustrate the misunderstanding.  I'm saying the same thing you said in a previous post;  We're using the term differently.  I'm also saying that I was under the false impression that no one really used it like you're using it anymore.</p>
<p>No judgement, just bad assumptions that led to surprise and misunderstanding.</p>

I don't know.  I identify as a gamer, but that's not some weird religious conviction.  I think that because I (1) play games regularly and RPGs in particular with my friends; (2) I frequently participate in online discussion of RPGs; and (3) I attend a number of gaming conventions and some other gatherings.  I feel these qualities make me a gamer.  In fact, I don't see how I can keep doing these things and not identify myself as a gamer.  Given that I do these things, if someone asked me "are you a gamer?", then I'd feel like I was lying if I said no.  <br><br>I had this at the last Amber game.  We were chatting, and Lee said something about talking to a friend, and that she didn't get something because she wasn't a gamer.  I looked surprised and looked around at ourselves, and she clarified that she thought of "gamer" as the mainstream meaning of "gamer" -- i.e. a computer gamer.  <br><br>Still, the point is that I'm surprised.  Say, I went out to dinner with an indie RPG author at GenCon whom I'd spoken to online for years, then someone asked her "Are you a gamer?" and she said "No".  I'd be confused.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<br>
The point I'm making is that the origin of the word is a word intended to hurt, to put down, to label, and ultimately control people who are different. And just like a lot of other labels, at some point we said, "Fuck you, that's who I am and I'm proud of it!" and started using it in a positive way. The admirable/benign connotation has become so taken for granted through social familiarity -- this whole geeky noosphere that's been built --  that it is forgotten that there was a "Fuck you" someplace in there. I'm saying we should not forget that.<br>
<br>
I don't know how "my social circle" got dragged into this. My social circle is still pretty fucking geeky. It has more to do with the larger society in which I live. It's like how I might pal-ishly call a friend, "What's up, motherfucker?" But it would be silly to pretend not to see anything wrong with using that word in all contexts.<br>
<br>
Here's my summary of our exchange, see if it sounds right with you:<br>
<br>
You: Hey! Some people use to word "geek" to mean something bad!<br>
Me: Ha ha. Very funny.<br/>
You: No, seriously. Dick.<br/>
Me: Huh?<br/>
You: Yup.<br/>
Me: Huh.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Not surprisingly, perhaps, I share Matt's sentiments down to the letter.<br/>
<br/>
When I played AD&amp;D in high school I was also collecting comic books and read SF (although, ultimately, I didn't care for the SF much!)<br/>
<br/>
Was I a geek? Sure. Was I socially awkward? You betcha!<br/>
<br/>
But... I had no idea there was such a thing as a geek, or I was part of a group of people "like me." I didn't feel like people were hating me. I did feel I was "wrong" somehow -- but that was just <i>depression</i> talking -- not other people.<br/>
<br/>
Because the outside world kind of liked me.<br/>
<br/>
Half the players in my AD&amp;D group were women. Three were cheerleaders. We didn't play down in the basement, but at my parent's dining room table -- with plenty of snacks. We had a fun, social time. Gaming was part of going to movies, debating in the Model Congress, acting in plays, writing articles for the paper... and so on. Not everyone did all these things. RPGs were just one point of intersection for several of us.<br/>
<br/>
Years later, back home for Christmas, a mother of one of my classmates referred to me as a "Big Man on Campus back in the high school days." Damn, I wished I known that. All I could think back in high school was, "Man, I'm never going to get enough sex."<br/>
<br/>
So, was I geek? Sure. Were there people hating me for it? Maybe -- but I never noticed them. I was just too busy trying to keep my own demons and depression at bay and having fun with the things that gave me happiness. So, this whole, "Those mundane people who have no imaginations unlike us," thing was a concept that never occurred to me. I had no interaction with the football players. They did what they did. I was afraid of sports. Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I bring all this up to get to this:<br/>
<br/>
I go to college. I have no contacts, so I meet up with the folks at the RPG club.<br/>
<br/>
I enter a new world. A whole vocabulary of inside jokes. Snippets of lines for "Holy Grail" out of context but always getting a laugh. Ten hour game sessions on Sundays. Insular and an almost siege-like sensibility against the rest of the campus socially. I feel weird with them.<i> I do not fit in.</i> I try for years... But I don't.<br/>
<br/>
I stop gaming. Because if that's what I have to be to game, I don't want it.<br/>
<br/>
And here's my specific addition to Matt's post...<br/>
<br/>
RPGs for me are not part of the "I'm imaginative / you're not tradition" or "I do this so you mock me tradition" or the "delight in the fringes of pop culture" tradition.<br/>
<br/>
When I said in High School to some friends, "Hey, I got this game you guys might like," I was excited because we were all into literature and art. And <i>that's</i> what RPGs are to me. They are an extension of storytelling and communal acts of creativity stretching back to the Greek Tragedies I was reading about in High School. I read the Hobbit after I started playing. I didn't read The Lord of the Rings until four years ago. What RPGs <i>meant</i> to me was the activity itself -- and the exploration of how we get together to make things up. It was just another form of stortelling -- just as a play, or a novel, or a movie all tell stories, but all in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
The minatures were a chance to paint. The handouts were a chance at design. The plots and improv of the characters all mattered in that they gave the players a chance to make hard choices for their characters. The choices of imagery -- the fantastical and larger than life -- all tapped my love of old fashioned stories of adventure and the supernatural. My source material were the Greek tragedies, the Homeric epics, Shakespeare, Edgar Allen Poe, Robert Louise Stevenson, Grimm's Fairy Tales... comic books like Tomb of Dracula, Dr. Strange, the utter weirdness of Howard the Duck and Marvel's terrific Conan adaptations.... Michael Moorcocks Swords Trilogy, Jules Verne, Robert E. Howard, H.G. Wells...  the books and plays I was reading in high school and on my own that were part of the shared language of my social group.<br/>
<br/>
But not Fantasy novels published by Tor. Not because I looked down on those novels -- I just never read them.<br/>
<br/>
When I got to college all that got swept away and I found myself with a group of people who didn't make sense to me. We didn't share a common background of fiction. And how they played was very different. It was about the shared, secret language of RPGs, fantasy books. And socially it was all about "We're <i>these</i> people, and we're not like <i>those</i> people."<br/>
<br/>
Was I trying to be cool? Did I think I was cool? No, and no. I never thought in those terms. (And I'm sort of surprised to see that issue still on the table for some people around here.)<br/>
<br/>
Whatever happened to me growing up, whatever it was that turned me on -- or whatever it was that didn't turn me -- all conspired to make me not share a lot with the people who play RPGs and identify themselves as<i> "gamers."</i> I'm not saying better than. I'm saying <i>not part of.</i><br/>
<br/>
I see no particular attachment of RPGs to geek <i>culture</i>. I can seperate them quite easily. I like the over-the-top storytelling technciques of Fantasy and SF -- where you turn the thematic dial up to 11 and have the hearts of the characters revealed in the monsters and machines of the world around them. But, again, that to me isn't geek. It's a kind of tradition of storytelling that goes back a few thousand years -- and that's what I thought RPGs were about.<br/>
<br/>
I could happily play an RPG with a bunch of football players. And I know they'd have a good time.<br/>

<p>Know what?  It's not the pejorative that surprised me so much.  That's a tangent.  It's the <em>socially disfunctional</em> part that genuinely surprised me.</p>

                            John, I feel some of the same social dissonances as you.  I play games every week and edit a journal on roleplaying, but I also feel repulsed by things like Munchkin, which seem to revel in the sort of "One Of Us!" exclusivist in-jokes that I don't feel party to or, even when I get them, worry about alienating outsiders.  There's that strange tension between wanting to be like "I game but I'm not a gamer" (which is a cop-out), "I'm a gamer but I'm not one of THOSE gamers" (which is elitist), or a more healthy response which is like "yeah, I'm a gamer, but to me that means x, y, and z."  And sometimes I wish for an identity to embrace without caveats, but there are precious few of those out there. I want to be a beautiful and unique snowflake, I guess (which is also kinda crap).                        </div>

I don't think you need caveats to the identity.  Regardless of what you identify with, you along with everyone else in the group is a snowflake.  <br><br>For example, amongst international company, I might identify myself as an American.  Now, there are a bunch of Americans whom I don't agree with.  I'm not representative of the majority of Americans.  So if people have stereotypes about what Americans are like, I'll have to correct them.  But I'm not going to not say that I'm an American because of that.  Similarly, I also identify with being a liberal, even though there are a lot of real liberal tendencies (as well as some false stereotypes) that I don't fit with.  <br><br>There are a lot of things about the gamer community which I don't like.  Common treatment of women (both in print and in person) is high on the list, for example.  There are also many ways I don't fit with the majority.  I don't play the most popular games: D&amp;D and Vampire.  But that isn't a caveat to my identity, just a standard part of being a member of a group who are not all identical.  I figure that if I stop talking and playing with other gamers at large (online or at conventions or other gatherings), then I'll stop identifying as a gamer.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Half the players in my AD&amp;D group were women. Three were cheerleaders. We didn't play down in the basement, but at my parent's dining room table -- with plenty of snacks. We had a fun, social time. Gaming was part of going to movies, debating in the Model Congress, acting in plays, writing articles for the paper... and so on. Not everyone did all these things. RPGs were just one point of intersection for several of us.</blockquote>
So this is the funny part of the definition / identity debate.  To you, saying "We didn't play down in the basement" and "we had a fun, social time" are part of the narrative by which you say "I don't fit in with geeks/gamers".  <br><br>I might have said very similar things, but to me the point would be "We geeks/gamers don't fit with the negative stereotypes people have of them."  <br><br>I don't think we have a factual disagreement here, but differ on our concept of the terms.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            The ways people articulate feelings of acceptance, belonging, and outsider status are strange and varied.  I often feel like, when we have these kinds of conversations, there's a lot less shared ground than when we talk about games that we're all sorta familiar with or even when we collaborate on design projects.<br><br>Recently, Mo's done some important new work on the Why People Roleplay question (probably the most important since Ron's "creative agendas," honestly), and I kinda wish someone would write something similar mapping out variations in the surrounding social environment. People seem to approach this hobby from a variety of backgrounds and that clearly affects how they operate once they're here. Plus, one's social environment clearly evolves over time, like Matt saying that he doesn't hang as much with self-indentified gamers or scifi-fantasy fans anymore.  But then some people get into roleplaying through fandom, because they like Buffy or Firefly or Marvel Superheroes or Robotech (that was me!) or Harry Potter or whatever.<br><br>Maybe mapping a bunch of "Types of Social Environments" out would make it easier to have these conversations, learning from the varying experiences of others instead of, by defualt, assuming everybody enjoys (or is annoyed by) getting a specific type of geek on.  Did I just volunteer for something again?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            It's good to see some other people (Matt, Christopher, Jonathan, etc) who share similar experiences, and a very similar outlook on games and "being a gamer".                        </div>

                            I don't know, Eric. Phrases like "out of touch" and "grew out of" and whatnot all seem to be implying that, at least in your experience, only inferior sorts use the negative definition. But that's just my perception, and probably not too important. I'll take your word for it that you're not using it judgmentally.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, you still have yet to reply to Matt's post from what I can see.<br/>

<p>Mike,</p>
<p>I'm glad you're gonna take my word for it on that one.  Because I think we're talking past each other now in a way that we could only resolve in person.</p>
<p>Which of Matt's posts are you talking about?  I don't see anything unresolved here.</p>

                            You said you might start a new thread? If you did, then disregard. But that was the comment I was looking at. I think it's item 31 above. Which I believe refers to Matt in 24.<br/>
