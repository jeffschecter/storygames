Typically, I start characters with a couple of Exhaustion points*; and I also ask the players to answer the question "What just happened to you?" collectively, so that the characters have a common point of contact. <br/><br/>And now I'm looking for tips from others who've run it at conventions. What's your best advice?<br/><br/><br/><br/>* This has its own pros and cons, and I want a change.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317540/#Comment_317540" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T01:24:13+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  1:24AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the best advice I can share is: downplay the negative aspects of Exhaustion &amp; Madness. Both times I've run the game at cons, the players have been nervous nellies who treat every die they roll as if its going to jump up and bite them on the nose; I don't think I saw any Madness dice hitting the table at all until 2 hours in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat might be a good thing in some games, but it tended to divide the experience into a first half of slightly weird goings on where the characters struggled to move forward, followed by an utterly Gonzo second half which turned into a cake walk for them. That might be the type of game you're looking for, of course, but next time I run it, I'm just going to start by explaining how to get the bonuses from Exhaustion and Madness and only say that "bad stuff may happen" if they overuse them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Comrade%20Andrew" title="Comrade Andrew"><img alt="Comrade Andrew" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Comrade%20Andrew">Comrade Andrew</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317625/#Comment_317625" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T16:57:59+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  4:57PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point for conventions in general.
