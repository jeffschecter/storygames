                    This: http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=44&amp;page=1#Item_50 (graphical character sheets) triggered an idea: a game in which characters have powers which are linked to the planets (either our familiar planets or your own set), which wax and wane according to the position of the relevant planet versus the character's current position. Not in a linear way, though (strongest when overhead, weakest underfoot). No, no, too simple. In astrology, planets' influence is strongest overhead, when rising, when setting, and in imum coeli (i.e. the opposite to overhead), and they have different types of influence in these positions. See Wikipedia for details. Also, the relative positions of the different planets are relevant, and they are also complex (in opposition, in conjunction, in square - which I think means at right angles - and so forth). There is astrological software that can work this all out.<br/>
I'm just tossing out a random thought here - but has anyone heard of any game in which something like this was used? The drawbacks are obvious: Having to keep track of game time and location very accurately, and having complicated calculations (or constantly consulting a computer or charts). Maybe the good idea buried inside this is some way in which powers change over time and location so that characters don't always have the same relative powers to each other or the same absolute powers.                </div>

                            It would. I was thinking more about this:<br/>
* Each planet rules an area of life, e.g. Mercury = communication. I'm inspired here by C.S. Lewis's novel That Hideous Strength, where Merlin does the voodoo thing and lets the planetary intelligences ride him, so he can, for example, use the power of Mercury to confuse everyone's language Babel-style.<br/>
* (And/or) each planet rules a type of person, e.g. Mercury = thieves, Venus = lovers/bards, Mars = fighters, Jupiter = rulers etc.<br/>
* You could substitute a set of concentric cardboard circles for the orrery and move them every (game) hour or half-hour to reflect the changing position of the characters vis-a-vis the planets as the earth rotated. (You might need other circles which you moved every day, lunar cycle and year which told you how to move the various outer planet circles, and marks on the main set to tell you to move the inner planet circles to reflect the movement of Venus, Mercury etc.) The cardboard circles could have markings on them to indicate bonuses/minuses to the relevant abilities/occupations/types of activity.<br/>
* The trick would be to do it so that it was interesting and added to the game instead of being a pointless and boring mechanic. I kind of like the idea of vast cosmic forces influencing life on earth.                        </div>

OMG, very small tangent, but man, it would be the ultimate in self-mocking "forgey" games (as in, how a few others see some Forge games) if one of us designed a game that required a room-sized orrery for conflict resolution. "Orrery Not Included"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

I had an orrery when I was a kid.  It was designed to be put up on a corkboard.  It had these little pins representing the planets, and every day/week/month/whatever, you would move the pins to the appropriate dates.  Around the outside, it had a starmap of the ecliptic, so that you could see what constellation the planets were moving to.                        </div>

<p>Having to keep track of game time and location very accurately, and having complicated calculations (or constantly consulting a computer or charts)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here's a quick mechanics sketch -</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters have an astrological sign</li>
<li>When you want to inflict consequences on a character, you have to move an appropriate planet into that sign's house.</li>
<li>You move planets with some kind of time resource, pushing them along their paths. At certain points along the path, the board informs you to advance other planets. (There's no attempt to match these to the relative orbit speeds of the planets; it's simply a matter of making your decisions have consequences.)</li>
<li>When you create certain conjunctions, you can inflict subsidiary effects. They don't do whatever 'winning a conflict' does, but instead mechanically manipulate resources and so on.</li>

                            Hmmm. I don't know, Shreyas, for me the idea that the planets controlled the people (rather than vice versa) was kind of the point. The mechanic you propose would be a good one, but I wouldn't use it with planets because it's counterintuitive to real-world planets. I'd call it something else.<br/>
<br/>
Unless I've misunderstood your post.<br/>
<br/>
My further thoughts on this: since we are only interested in four times per day (when the planet is immediately above, immediately below, or crossing the horizon), you could do it with pre-printed tables, though they would be large (you might have to tweak them so that the same times of day recurred every X months/weeks or something). As the characters would base the (in-game) time they did things on the favourable planetary positions it might well work in practice. <br/>

<p>No, you haven't. I just thought "the planets controlled the people" was a pretty much bad point, assuming that by "the people" you mean both "the players" and "the characters".</p>
<p>I generally don't think it's particularly fun having bin complicated mechanics that don't have meaningful player input.</p>

                            Fair enough. But if it wasn't big and complicated, how about the atmosphere of "huge cosmic forces are controlling aspects of my life, how do I work around that and retain agency?"<br/>

                            Hmm. Yes, probably a good principle.<br/>
<br/>
Taking a step back from the specifics, what I had at the back of my mind, I think, is how premodern people often had this sense of helplessness and fear and constraint in the face of the cosmos - something we have largely lost, not altogether appropriately in some circumstances IMO. In the right kind of settings, something which would create at least an echo of that might be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
It was really just a wild thought experiment, not something I'm actually planning to use - I'm glad a few people got some thought-provocation out of it, anyway.                        </div>

                            Helplessness can be projected with unpredictability rather than just tying the player's hands about their fate. If a player wants to push an alignment, everyone else's planetarty alignment changes too. Maybe you just gave your competition a huge boost because you didn't know they had a strong affinity for Orion when you moved Mars.                        </div>

                            OK, new thoughts on this, stimulated by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=897&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">this thread on the new Koplow dice catalog</a>. <br/><br/>Fred mentions Keplerian solids. One of Kepler's theories that didn't quite work out (though it was a nice try) was that the orbits of the planets would fit within imaginary nested Platonic solids. You know, like those dice you play RPG with. (This isn't actually what's meant by Keplerian solids, that's something slightly different, but I'm bouncing off the idea in a lateral kind of way here.) <br/>I have this odd but fascinating book right here that I got for the geometric art that's another interest of mine - <i>Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice</i> by Robert Lawlor (Thames and Hudson, 1982) - which has an illustration of Kepler's vision of the solar system; looks like it goes (from the outside) cube (d6), tetrahedron (d4), dodecahedron (d12), octahedron (d8), icosahedron (d20). (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Kepler#Mysticism" rel="nofollow">the Wikipedia article on Kepler</a> for the same illo.)<br/><br/>So, at character creation you throw 2d6. 1=Mercury, 2=Venus, 3=Earth, 4=Mars, 5=Jupiter, 6=Saturn (the six Keplerian planets). This gives your character two planetary affinities, a primary and a secondary. For example, someone can be mercurial and martial, meaning they first of all will resort to trickery and fast talk, but if pressed will fight. This gives you an instant "type" to play.<br/><br/>So someone challenges someone else in the game (PC or NPC, doesn't matter, all are generated the same way). The challenge will have a planetary sphere associated with it: physical conflict = Mars, etc. This determines one of the dice used (the one that has the shape contained by the orbit of the planet - so a d12 for Mars). Because there are six planets and five platonic solids, Mercury gets a d10 (which isn't a platonic solid). The other die used will be the one associated with each player's primary planetary affinity.<br/><br/>You roll the dice and narrate according to what comes up - there are two simultaneous conflicts going on, one in the sphere indicated by the main dice, but another in the spheres - likely to be different - indicated by the players' affinity dice, and all of this gets narrated. (For example: Sphere of Mars, physical conflict. Challenger is mercurial and veneral, challenged is earthy and jovial. At the same time that they're trying to skewer each other, the challenger is trying to convince the challenged that she should give up, using fast talk; the challenged is taking a stable stance and refusing.) <br/>The two dice each person rolls are evaluated separately, so you could win the physical contest (on d12s) but lose the other contest (d10 versus d8). You can then switch to your second die and have another contest on those terms. The challenged, having won one of the two contests, can either switch dice or not to deal with the new challenge. In this case, keeping with the d8 would be smarter since joviality only gives you a d4, versus the challenger's d20. Again, the outcome is narrated by both players based on their die rolls (indicating how successfully they deployed their planetary affinities). <br/><br/>The stakes could also be related to the planetary affinities - and the size of the dice, which would balance things a bit (otherwise the poor old jovials will be kicked around all the time).<br/><br/>Again, this is a thought-starter, not a fully worked-out system, but it makes for nice quick character generation, and the narrative emerges out of the dice rolls in an organic way.                        </div>

                            To keep the die size as less of a big deal, you could have the one who rolls lowest and the one who rolls highest each get something out of the contest.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Fred, that triggered off a solution (which wasn't yours, but without your idea might not have happened): If you roll the highest possible roll on the die you are using, you don't lose, regardless of the roll on your opponent's die. By my mental calculations (which could be wrong), that makes d4 and d6 into very nearly equal opponents and means that even in d4 vs d20, d4 will win about a third of the time.<br/><br/>Another idea: the platonic solids are located <i>between</i> the planets, so you choose a die based on which direction your opponent is in - closer to or further from the sun. So a saturnine always uses a d6, but a jovial uses a d6 vs saturnine and a d4 vs martial.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if this might end up as a Kepler-themed game, with events in his life (such as his mother being tried for witchcraft) providing the settings and challenges.                        </div>

                            Okay, just look at this bit:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.khaldea.com/kldaephem/2000/images/e2006jul_gmt.gif<br/>
<br/>
The columns refer to each planet.<br/>
<br/>
The rows are the days of the month.<br/>
<br/>
The values in the body of the chart describe the location of that planet in the sky, during that month.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's a single value.  That's because planets are always found in the plane of the ecliptic.<br/>
<br/>
Each planet is described in terms of how far into the "sign" they have progressed.  The sky is divided into twelve sectors, each of which is assigned one of the constellations of the zodiac.<br/>
<br/>
So let's take, for example, mercury on July 5, 2006.<br/>
<br/>
The value is "1 22'22."  This means that today, Mercury is 1 degree, 22 minutes, 22 seconds into its sign.  Which sign is it?  You have to look at the top of the column for that, right after the '1'.  That little squiggle is Leo.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.astrologycom.com/zodiac2.html<br/>
<br/>
So the ephemeris tells you that today, July 5, Mercury is in the first degree of leo.<br/>
<br/>
"Why is it red?" the more perspicacious of you will ask.<br/>
<br/>
Aha, that's because today, Mercury is RETROGRADE.  When a planet is retrograde, that means that it appears, in the sky, to be doubling back on its path.  (I'll leave the astronomical explanation to the scientists, this is mysticism dammit!)  You see how mercury's ephemeris values are going down rather than up?  There you go.  When a planet is retrograde, its influence is reversed.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions?                        </div>
