The book is Keith A. Chandler's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cZ4DAAAACAAJ" rel="nofollow">Beyond Civilization: The World's Four Great Streams of Civilization</a> (not to be confused with Daniel Quinn's much more popular book of a similar name). This is a great book, at least for my definition of great, which is "it made me think about something in a way I'd never considered before". I won't try to convince you that its is "great" in any other sense. It is clearly flat wrong in many places, and uses somewhat questionable reasoning in others, for example.<br/><br/>Two things in this book struck me as being useful for gaming. <br/><br/>The first is his definition of "civilization". For a frame of reference, the title of the first chapter is "What was civilization?" The notion of the book is that there are particular ways that societies choose to organize themselves. The most dominant for the last few millennia has been something called "civilization". (And, as you might guess from the title of the chapter and the book, he's pretty certain that we have already moved away from this thing called "civilization" and are in the process of inventing a new way to organize societies.) The author claims that any historical society is a "civilization" if it has <i>all</i> of these characteristics.\n<ol><li>A hierarchical social organization dominated by a power elite which is not accountable to the powerless majority and for whose actions there is little to no redress.</li><li>Concentration of power and wealth in fortified urban centers.</li><li>Written language, the understanding and use of which are monopolized by the elite and its functionaries.</li><li>An economic system which vests title to the wealth produced by the society in the elite and controls that wealth by a strictly measured allocation of all industrial, agricultural, forestry and mining resource within the control of the central power.</li><li>Skills training and labor specialization designed to serve the goals of the power elite.</li><li>Extensive slavery or serfdom.</li><li>A grand mythology portraying society as originating from and continuing to be influenced by suprahuman powers with the elite as the conduit of that influence.</li><li>A military establishment which is utilized not only for external defense and agression, but also for internal control and repression of the dispossessed majority.</li></ol>\nOne thing that takes some getting used to in the book is, the way this list is defined and used, it defies counterexample. That is, if you think of a culture that doesn't meet these definitions, then it isn't that the list is wrong, but rather that the culture isn't a "civilization" (even though you might think of it as one). The author mentions two such cultures in the book: the Minoans and the Inca. It isn't that these societies weren't impressive or advanced. They just didn't organize under the characteristics above and, therefore, are not "civilizations". In other words, the value judgment that implies superiority of "civilization" over "non-civilization" is absent from this book; "civilization" is just a set of traits. (In fact, the author raises the point that nearly all of these traits can be viewed as morally worse than the traits that shape "precivilized" societies, which tend to be more about communal welfare.)<br/><br/>In the same way, if the cultures you've invented for your games don't fit these criteria, they are not "civilizations" either, and this suggests three courses of action:\n<ol><li>You can view this as your culture being unfinished or "unrealistic", and make changes to better fit the definition.</li><li>You can view this as intentional, and spend some time thinking about how the culture reacts to "civilization". Did the culture have a civilized period that it "outgrew"? Did it never reach that stage? If so, how did it manage feats that (in real world history, anyway) weren't done without civilization, such as monument building? What allowed it to skip or transcend civilization?</li><li>You could follow most of the traits, but base the culture on how it avoids or counters one or two others, and how it manages to do so.</li></ol>\nThe second idea in the book that is useful for rpg society design is what the author calls "minds". The premise of this idea that, over time, various worldviews congeal in certain places that focus the people in the societies into motivations and behaviors from which civilization emerges. By the author's reckoning, this has happened four times in human history, each about a thousand years apart (in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC, the Indus valley around 2500 BC, China around 1500 BC and the Yucatan around 500 BC).<br/><br/>There is a lot to this notion, but for purposes of gaming, what is interesting is how he breaks down these four "minds". He picks a concept and its complement (in his case "order" and "non-order") and attempts to illustrate that these "minds" differ in how they choose to embrace or avoid these two concepts. It sounds a bit wacky, but is actually fairly convincing in the book. He offers a table like this:<table>\n<tr><th>Order</th><th>Non-Order</th><th>Civilization</th><th>Dominant Theme</th><th>Dominant Concern</th></tr><tr><td>Embrace</td><td>Embrace</td><td>"Sinic" (i.e China)</td><td>Balance</td><td>Society</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Embrace</td><td>Avoid</td><td>"Occidental" (i.e the "West")</td><td>Transformation</td><td>Nature</td></tr><tr><td>Avoid</td><td>Embrace</td><td>"Indic" (i.e India)</td><td>Transcendence</td><td>Self</td></tr><tr><td>Avoid</td><td>Avoid</td><td>"Amerindic" (i.e. Mesoamerican, such as the Mayan)</td><td>Precariousness</td><td>Time</td></tr></table>\nNow, whether you believe the specifics of this table or not isn't really the point here. Instead, just the notion of creating a table like this to define societies within a game seems interesting. Imagine, for example, a world where four mindsets form based on the notions of "perception" and "non-perception". Or on "metal" and "non-metal". Or even "rainbows" and "unicorns".<br/><br/>Where does it take you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263675/#Comment_263675" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T09:21:56+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  9:21AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently creating the outline of a civilization for a new Burning Wheel game.

That, say, the Occidental mind lives on as Western civilization? Does he suggest a reason why a single issue, such as Order, should be such a pervasive shaper of civilization?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263759/#Comment_263759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T16:05:54+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  4:05PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes to the first: he assumes that the mind not only gave rise to the civilization, but continues to shape it over its lifetime. The central bit of the book uses the minds as lenses through which the civilizations can be compared and understood from several angles (mythology, philosophy, art, law, physical training and sex).<br/><br/>No to the second: he does not spend time pondering why "order" is the important thing and not, say, "Emotion".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263883/#Comment_263883" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T09:18:02+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  9:18AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of "minds as a lens for comparison."
