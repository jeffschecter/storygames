I don't see much of a problem with that, as it seems to me most forms of magic would be easily handled as traits/resources - after all, what's a fireball spell but a physical offensive resource? <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things kind of mess me up, though. First, healing spells. The attrition of damage taken over the course of an adventure is so integrated with the Beast Hunters system, how do you mess with it and not make things "too easy"? One thought I had was to make the character being healed pay with Reward Points, since future Challenges won't be as risky for them. Or would it be more in the spirit of the game to make the act of healing someone a Challenge in itself, with the character doing the healing risking physical or mental exhaustion?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, would it break the game to have Conflicts be in different domains for different participants? For example, combat is a physical Conflict for the most part - but if the player's a mage, what they'll probably be doing most of the time when maneuvering is casting spells to protect themselves or trip up the opposition. Forcing them to use their mental Traits at half efficiency only in that context would kind of cripple them, which feels wrong.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308448/#Comment_308448" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T13:05:35+00:00" title="January 16, 2011  1:05PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi there,<br/><br/>Since you're not going to have beast tattoos, you could create powers instead.  Then assign a few to different classes; that's very fantasy.  So "heal x on another character" could be a power that one of the PCs has, and they can use it y times per adventure.  Then the fighter character gets "add x to your strike roll", also usable y times, etc.  It's a bit of work, but I think it's a better solution than using reward points.  Alternatively, we can take a page from Agon and say, "you can heal, but it'll give a certain number of adversity points to the Challenger."<br/><br/>As to domains, I'm less enamored with them now than I used to be.  If you're going to have a classic fantasy feel, I'd say don't use them.  Especially if you're doing dungeon crawly stuff, so mostly fighting.  For more complex things like urban or social intrigue-flavored games, you could replace them with "combat, intrigue, stealth" or something like that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
