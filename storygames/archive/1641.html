                    I'm interested in figuring out the most effective and the most engaging rules voice to write in.  They may not be the same.  For example:<br/><br/><b>SECOND PERSON, PLAYER POV</b><br/>If your character is fifteen years old, always increment your Vignette die result down by one and your Mission die result up by one.  <br/><br/><b>SECOND PERSON, CHARACTER POV</b><br/>If you are fifteen years old, always increment your Vignette die result down by one and your Mission die result up by one.  <br/><br/><b>THIRD PERSON, PLAYER POV</b><br/>If a player character is fifteen years old, the player must always increment his Vignette die result down by one and his Mission die result up by one.  <br/><br/>Many game text tend to drift a bit from one voice to another, probably because they are well suited for different tasks.  Mostly I'm concerned with clarity and clearly splitting player and character actions.  <br/><br/>Thoughts on this?  Any examples of texts that are particularly clear and still readable and fun?<br/><br/>(edited for person mistake)                </div>

                            Speaking as someone who tends to write in the 3rd person, player POV, (passive voice even) it's pants.  Avoid it.  Shoot for second person, in terms of actual prose, keep character and player separate.  If rules are at all complex, review them in third person, in a procedural style - lists and flowcharts.                        </div>

                            I like 2nd person for the 'feel' of it - it's certainly a much more friendly way to write rules.  However, I find that it's far too easy to slip up on references to 'you', meaning the player, and 'you' meaning the character.  So I tend to write in a 3rd-person (active!), but run it through with some humor, so it's a bit like hearing the voiceover guy for movie trailers cracking wise.<br/><br/>In a side note, Josh AC Newman's writing voice is exactly like his posting/chatting voice, which makes reading Shock: very intimate-seeming.                        </div>

I know <em>exactly</em> what you mean.  When I'm tell you anything about how to write rules text, I'm really telling myself.  And I'm one of the hordes who likes Vincent's style in <cite>Dogs,</cite> where he goes so far as to say "you" for the player and "me" for the GM, which works really well, but I don't think it belongs in every game.<br/><br/>As far as distinguishing "you," the player and "you," the character, that's tricky regardless.  It's completely worth it's own proofread all by itself for me.  But that applies for 3rd person as well.                        </div>

                            There are plenty of games where it doesn't much matter which of the first two you pick. But whenever you talk about something with the distinction between player and character, you better be damn careful.<br/>

                            I almost categorically prefer second-person, player POV.<br/><br/>Second Person is more intimate.  Third person is less intimate and often hard to parse, as you say.<br/><br/>Character POV is almost always bad news.  You're not talking to the character; you're talking to the player.  So talk to the player.                        </div>

                            Personally, I think its more personal style than any inherent 2nd vs 3rd person advantage. Vincent is a very clear writer, and used 2nd person to very good effect in Dogs. The tone in Dogs is very causal, and 2nd person definitely works better for that.<br/><br/>For some reason, I can't get 2nd person to work with my style of writing. 3rd person feels more natural for my own writing, and I think it shows in the text of my book. (I go for a more "I'm going to give you all the information and then let you make the decisions and figure things out" educational style in my writing, and I think the slightly more detached 3rd person works better for that.)<br/><br/>In lieu of any hard scientific studies that say one is better than the other, I think its more about finding your voice as a writer, and then letting your text be what it wants to be. I think having a coherent voice will do more than awkwardly slapping together different writing techniques.<br/><br/>As a point of reference, check out the text of My Life with Master. Paul does use 2nd person from time to time, but he also frequently addresses the <i>character</i> rather than the players. As in "The Master invites soemone over for dinner" and the Minion has problems relating to normal people". There's a certain detached quality to the writing that just <i>works</i> for the game.                        </div>

                            Talking directly to your reader is a common tool used by professional writers to avoid making assumptions of gender:<br/><br/><i>A player must then roll four six-sided dice, add them up, and report his total to the GM.</i><br/><br/>versus<br/><br/><i>Roll four six-sided dice, add them up, and report the total to your GM.</i><br/><br/>Avoiding conflation between players and characters is, in my opinion, a very tricky issue. The line between player activity and player-as-character activity is so grey that explaining it can lead to problems. I've used two techniques in the past to clarify agency and the separation between players and characters, but I'm not sure how well they work in the practice of a complete set of rules.<br/><br/>â€¢ Your audience (player or GM) is always addressed in the second person ("you"); characters are always addressed in the third person (that is, they're identified as entities external to your audience).<br/><br/>â€¢ To help cement the separation between audience and the "roles" they assume, do two things: when your audience must be in a certain mode for your instruction, us an "as " construction ("as player, you create a single protagonist character you will use during play, as a GM you will create all the minor characters your group will encounter during play"); when you need to separate a player from a character in the same sentence, assume that the character is female ("to assign scores for your characters attributes, roll 3D6 for all her physical attributes, and 2D6+6 for all her social attributes").<br/><br/>(The reason I chose to do this last bit lies with English-speaking culture's "default male assumption" that seems built in to the language and culture. By assigning female gender to most characters in the text, you take advantage of the English-speaking bias to provide a "natural" separation between the player and the character entities. This may work more effectively for some readers than others; for example, the efffect is perhaps more pronounced in male readers than female readers, but I'm not a neuro-linguist, so I don't know about the general applicability of the effect: I just noticed that it seemed to make for more clear writing for <i>me</i> (middle-aged white male) as reader.)<br/><br/>There may be specific cases, mostly for examples, where you need to explicitly identify a group of players or characters. In those cases, best to ascribe names and associated genders as appropriate; often it's a good idea to choose an even mix of genders, and it's also good to choose a "standard set" of players and their characters that trace through all the examples in the book.                        </div>
