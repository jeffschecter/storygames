Or at least I am. It's still not quite pressing my buttons, possibly because I'm not sure what direction my character is being pushed in and the different moves are so different from character to character that we don't seem to be on the same page sometime. My Hardholder is worrying about the Holding, someone else is concerned about a tank and someone else about scavenging.<br/><br/>And then we realised we were supposed to be having sex with each other, so we did some of that too. As the generous sort, I was giving out Barter-1 for a fumble in the back of helicopter and something more relaxed with a Brainer. Of course he scanned my character and so I revealed "in what ways are [my] character\u2019s mind and soul vulnerable".<br/><br/>I went for "I care too much". And now I have to care about what happens to my people. This seems to be going somewhere much more interesting now. Perhaps I needed that question much earlier on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197674/#Comment_197674" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T16:59:16+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  4:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's interesting.
