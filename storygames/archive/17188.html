My character is the queen. At the start I said, she uses sex as a weapon. And anyone she has sex with becomes a member of her gang (and also is infected with something as yet unspecified). She's filling an emotional void and seeing power as a means in itself. Definitely not a Kantian.<br/><br/>She had sex with the Infernal's runner (he's a dealer), whilst he was watching, to show the Infernal who's boss.<br/>She had sex in a ritual with her gang and another PC (to make him part of the gang, it's a cult thing with rituals).<br/>She had a fight with another PC and then turned her on in the middle of the fight but denied her sex and gave her a condition instead. This was in the canteen.<br/><br/>Some other PCs have had sex, although mostly with NPCs, mostly with members of my gang although there was also a priest.<br/><br/>So how much actual sex happens in your games, as opposed to the promise or threat?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389885/#Comment_389885" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T03:23:27+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  3:23AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a Vampire in the game we had at the MKRPG, so lots of flirting and getting close, but no actual sex, as the Vampire's sex move discourages it.

Drama!<br/><br/>Now the Ghost is hooking up with the Werewolf, which is actually a pretty good match because she's prone to crazy murderous urges and he can't die! (Took the Ghoul move and everything.) It's a... it's a complicated relationship. But they've had sex a few times.

Mostly that's because when the PCs aren't having sex on-camera, they're having sex off-camera (as in, they're in committed relationships, so nobody gives a fuck), plotting to have sex, or foreplaying.<br/>In fact, I wish they had more on-camera actual-sex, so more sex moves could get triggered. If there were no mechanics to the sex moves, I would've packed this game in long ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389967/#Comment_389967" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T16:17:23+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  4:17PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is that in one session (as ours was Mcdaldno)?</blockquote>\nJulia's talking about the <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2810.0" rel="nofollow">Mirkshires</a> game that Evan Torner has been running.

In that same session, two other PCs (the Werewolf and Ghost) had sex. Then Ping had sex with another character in the following session, then in the session after that, the Werewolf and Ghost had sex again.<br/><br/>[cross-posted with Mcdalno.

Enough said. By the 3rd scene she was engaged in a necrophilic/bestiophilic/voyeuristic/quasi-incestuous congress with the darkest self of the werewolf. So while they were rutting away for most of the night I think it only counts as 2 sex moves or 1 sex scene. Oddly enough, things cooled off after that as she homed in on the werewolf who was refused to sleep with her as his normal self. She spent a while dead, as well, but would have made it with one of the Scoobies if she hadn't scared him with the open bullet wound in her head as she made her move. <br/><br/>2nd one-shot:<br/>On the night before the big game, we had a Werewolf go round to the Witch's bedroom in order to get his letterman jacket (a token) back from her. He succeeded, but then of course the Witch's sex move got another token from him (I'd prefer not to go into exactly what he left behind). That same night, the fear-hungry Ghoul also ended up having sex with the Mortal in the locker room in front of the lacrosse team and cheerleaders. He then passed his Hold Steady check _to keep going_ until he was finally dragged off and held under a shower by the rest of the team. We had nearly had one earlier as the Queen made a move on the Witch out in the desert, but the players decided it wasn't quite the right moment and so made a promise instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390570/#Comment_390570" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T13:41:00+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  1:41PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like all the sex in our game has got to Graham so we're playing something different this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390575/#Comment_390575" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T13:48:38+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  1:48PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That might not help.
