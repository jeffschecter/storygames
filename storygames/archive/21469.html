This is especially an issue in games like PBTA which don't really have specific skills on the character sheet, just Moves.<br/><br/>Examples from real or proposed games:<br/>1) Monster hunters who drive around in their van, playing rock shows with songs about hunting monsters.<br/><br/>2) Star Wars games where every character has their own X-Wing fighter, but they spend a lot of time doing espionage and wild hijinks between attack runs.  <br/><br/>But it could be anything, really. In a game where you create your character with a point buy system, you can just allocate some points into your special skill, and if everybody is roughly equal in their investment in skills, it should be pretty much a wash.  <br/><br/>But what about in a PBTA game where there's no place to write "Funky Slap Bass 30%" or Piloting 4?  In the second example, we're using the Star Wars World hack for the game, but we're still having a problem that only 4 of the 12 playbooks come with a spaceship and only one is the specific fighter pilot playbook.  It's like in Reservoir Dogs, everybody wants to be Mr. Black. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469831/#Comment_469831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T20:39:21+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  8:39PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why does this cause a problem?<br/><br/>What's wrong with saying, "Characters in this game can all/all know how to ______"?<br/><br/>I'm curious what actually happens in play that you're unsatisfied with.<br/><br/>If anything, I often feel that RPGs try too hard to differentiate characters' ability to do things. It's more interesting (and easy) to say that anyone can do something, and let them play their characters as they wish. (Presumably the game isn't all about how well you do that thing, after all; if it IS, then you can build interesting decisions into the *doing* itself. See <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> for inspiration - the characters don't at all need to have different aptitudes at handling conflict. Rather, it's the choices they make to get into specific conflicts and to escalate them which are interesting to us.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469837/#Comment_469837" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T22:33:31+00:00" title="February  8, 2018 10:33PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main problem is that of Readability.

Note that most of the game time is not spent doing those things, it's a background activity that occasionally becomes the focus. <br/><br/>I guess it could be handled off-screen, mostly, but you still need some way of generating interesting results to feed back into the game. <br/><br/>There seem to be three approaches to this:<br/>1) Treat it just like any other conflict and just uses whatever moves seem to fit on their character sheet; this is pretty abstract. Also means that their fighting style, or musical style, or whatever, would line up with their style on everything else.<br/>2) Everybody has a "Do this thing" skill on their character sheet and uses that. Pretty generic.<br/>3) Add special moves, as ValyrianSteelKatana suggests, and basically make a minigame out of it. This seems like the most flavorful option, but requires a lot of prep, a bunch of unplaytested rules, and a whole section of the character sheet only used for this one thing. <br/><br/>Well, I remember an actual play somewhere of Monsterhearts where the GM actually created a sort of little boardgame version of lacrosse for one session, complete with player markers with the character's pictures on them.  That looked really cool but is probably out of my league.  <br/><br/><br/>I'm hoping that someone will have faced this already and have a brilliant approach to this!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469857/#Comment_469857" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T17:27:58+00:00" title="February  9, 2018  5:27PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are lots of easy/simple solutions to that kind of "problem".<br/><br/>To me, equal competence in a given field just opens up other possibilities.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>* Make engaging in that "arena" all about character expression. You're equally effective, but you get to describe your character doing in colourful ways.<br/><br/>* You can all do the activity; what's interesting to us is <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> you choose to engage in it. (The example of Dogs in the Vineyard conflicts is perfect here.)<br/><br/>* Include some interesting choices in the activity itself, so that each player can approach it differently. For instance, maybe everyone can pilot a spaceship, but you have to design your own ship. In designing a ship, you have to make some tough decisions, inevitably differentiating it from others'. <br/><br/>* Since everyone is doing it together, make it all about teamwork. Your options are all about choosing a course of action and then helping the others in it. Perhaps set things up so that no one can have a good chance of succeeding on their own; instead, they need to ask for the support of their comrades.<br/><br/>Another good example is OSR-style D&amp;D, where player cleverness is required to solve puzzles. In such a scenario, mechanical character differentiation is not only unnecessary but also unwelcome - we *want* everyone to be able to contribute as fully as they can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469860/#Comment_469860" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T17:40:37+00:00" title="February  9, 2018  5:40PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why would people who do the same thing usually hang together? I'd say that it's because either the activity requires teamwork (as in the band) or that their approach to it benefits from teamwork (as in a bunch of pilots) So the minigame must be basically about teamworking.<br/><br/>You can reduce the amount of prep by relying on a somewhat simple houserule, though how simple may depend on the game. Basically everyone describes their contribution to the task, all contributions are taken into account and then the die is rolled against a difficulty set by the GM, adding +1 for each contribution. Each player can add more than one contribution if plausible given the fiction constraints. <br/><br/>In case there are specific mechanisms/skills for their contribution they can use and/or you want to resolve the whole deal task by task, each one can roll separately / engage their particular mechanic. Their contribution still counts +1 to he total if successful, or even more if the group gives it enough credit. It can be a penalty instead if they fail to put it in practice. The GM can forego the roll for the scene resolution if enough contributions are made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469875/#Comment_469875" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T04:40:40+00:00" title="February 10, 2018  4:40AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm just here for the Firesign references)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
