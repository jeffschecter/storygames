The game works, the rules are fine and clearly written. But they need the hand of a native speaker to get flow and to remove the final wrinkles in the text.<br/><br/>I could use some help with the following:<br/>- Cover art/logo for a box.  I could do it myself, and it will be OK. Or I could get some help and it would look great!<br/>- Design of the cards in the game. I have done it myself, they are OK. I could get some help and they would look great!<br/>- Spreading the word of this awesome game. I have done it myself and I'm not doing a good job.<br/><br/>Are you interested in doing any of the above?<br/><br/>The current version of TDoV will remain free for download, but it is a bother to print and assemble all the cards. I think more people would get to play and enjoy the game if they could just buy a ready to play kit.<br/><br/><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/the-daughters-of-verona/" rel="nofollow">wilper.wordpress.com/the-daughters-of-verona/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355407/#Comment_355407" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T02:21:18+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  2:21AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Asking for help is a very sensible thing.

And I think the characters look rather nice.<br/><br/>I might "pad" the game with a set och character cards in modern clothes, for those who want to play generic present day romantic comedy and "modern remakes of Shakespeare", but art for those could be random portraits from stock photographs. That wouldn't be much work.<br/><br/>As for the other deck and manual, no, the game doesn't need much art.<br/><br/>A pretty cover would definitely be first on the agenda for an artist, but I'm sure I can find some stock/Public Domain art to use there as well if I need to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355421/#Comment_355421" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T05:26:14+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  5:26AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case you're interested, the sort of "padding" or rounding-out material I all but expected for the game would be a tragedy mode ("Kings of Albion", eh): a different set of character and event cards set in England instead of Italy, evoking the other well-known half of Shakespeare's oeuvre. Maybe a slight bit of rules changes to account for the variant genre. It seems to me that this sort of "double feature" would make the game-as-product more appealing, as it'd map a wider range of possibilities, all without actually increasing the scope of the game as a design all that much; you even say it in the rules text, that rules chassis pretty much does tragedy with minimal changes already.<br/><br/>(Having a substantial addition to the print version, whatever it might be, seems like a good idea regardless, as it'd be sort of a perk for people who support you by buying the print edition.)<br/><br/>And for what it's worth, I agree that the game carries well with public domain art. Needs graphic design to make the cards etc. look slick, but that's surely something you'll find help with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355422/#Comment_355422" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T05:27:12+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  5:27AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>I would like to have the game ready in time for people to give it as X-mas gifts this year.

Yet!  I got some collaborators, but since I couldn't specify what I wanted I couldn't get any real help.<br/><br/>Now I know what I want!<br/><br/>And I reached that state after watching an unsatisfactory stage play.  I posted about it on G+, but for the benefit of those of you who haven't circled <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/108522476895155385469/108522476895155385469/posts" rel="nofollow">Wilhelm's games in development</a> I reshare it here.\n<blockquote><br/>Games could teach you how to write comedies<br/><br/>Yesterday I went and saw the spex at the local university. Spex is a Swedish and Finnish tradition of student amateur theater comedy, with song and dance numbers. Sometimes they rhyme.<br/><br/>As spexes go, the first act was ok. The second act was horrible. There was a whole scene about how the king failed to eat a sandwich, and while some found it funny, it didn't carry the story forward one iota.<br/><br/>And after the final scene I was left with a vague feeling of dissatisfaction. The bad guy had died (drank her own poison by mistake), the princess and the builder were married (sort of, suddenly they had been married when they entered the stage for the final scene), and the obligatory historical 'fact' had been revealed. (This time it was why the Taj Mahal came to look the way it does.)<br/><br/>Yet it didn't feel complete. Something was missing. And that something had been missing in several spexes I had seen in the past.<br/><br/>The bread-failing widower king got arrested, leaving the love stricken maid behind, all alone. The bad guy prince became the new king. And then the final curtain dropped.<br/><br/>WTF!<br/><br/>Let's look at that again, this time with The Daughters of Verona in mind (or for those of you who have missed this free storygame of Shakespearean comedy: Five act Elizabethan comedy).<br/><br/>The bread-failing widower king got arrested, leaving the love stricken maid LOVER behind, all alone. The bad guy prince BLOCKER became the new king. And then the FINAL curtain dropped.<br/><br/>They only got as far as half way through the third act of their five act story. We never got to the resolution. That's why we were left feeling that something was missing. And as I think back on the other spexes I've seen in the past and haven't liked, they suffer from similar problems in the script.<br/><br/>The prince turned king was a bad guy, we can't leave him there in a position of power. He should repent, be sent away or in some other way corrected. The poor servant girl lover should get her match up.<br/><br/>Then we would have felt satisfied with the story.<br/></blockquote>\nI want to make TDoV into a tool to show people "how it should work".  And it should be fun, and the game should look like a playbill.<br/><br/>To do that I will need a pretty cover for the book. And I will need at least 10, but preferably 16-20 character illustrations. Full body, color, in period clothing. But not very high in detail, just enough so that the "audience will recognize the characters on stage by what they're wearing".<br/><br/>And then we'll make new cards with those portraits, and the first part of the book will explain the background of the story The Daughters of Verona, and the characters.  Just like a proper playbill.  And then the rules will be in the back.<br/><br/>I think I'll make a DeLuxe edition with cards and five copies of the playbill rulebook.  Enough to sit down with four of your friends and play the prepared "intro adventure" with this lovely artifact. (The game is perfectly playable with just one set of rules, but having a book each will make it more attractive to gamers who want to play with mundanes.)<br/><br/>How will I go about doing all these things?  I have no idea.  I don't know who'll help me, what it will cost, or when it will be done.  But now I know what I want!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382262/#Comment_382262" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-14T01:19:13+00:00" title="June 14, 2012  1:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2012 1:30AM by Wilhelm.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a short update on the current status.<br/><br/><b>Good stuff</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Prices must have dropped a bit at SuperiorPOD.
