If you\u2019d like to get invovled registration for the alpha is now open on the official Civ World registration page, but in order to take part, you\u2019ll have to put a team of between 5 and 50 people first."</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.2kgames.com/civworld/alpha/registration.php" rel="nofollow">Civ World Registration</a><br/><br/>Civ World (formerly Civ Network) is about to go Alpha and in order to get in on the Alpha you need to create a team of players. Not quite sure how team building is actually going to work yet, but during the registration process I created a team called "Owlbear".<br/><br/>Are there others who would be interested on getting in on the Alpha? I figure the bigger the team we can put together, the better the chances are of getting in.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307527/#Comment_307527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T12:05:20+00:00" title="January  9, 2011 12:05PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I signed up for a team called "Owlbear<b>s</b>" with Tony Dowler as captain a couple days ago and I think a few other S-G'ers did as well.
