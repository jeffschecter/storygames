                    This won't be a full report or anything, but I can' stay quiet about several cool things in a recent game of <a href="http://www.primevalpress.com/games/birds" rel="nofollow">City of Birds</a>.<br/><br/><strong>The Set-up</strong><br/><br/>Our City is at the heart of this icy, Tsarist-Russia-type empire. Except it's Polish, not Russian. And we don't just have armies "with iron." We have horses pulling sledges. And we have elite polar bear divisions. Instant buy-in. I mean, c'mon... POLAR BEARS. WITH RIDERS. WHO KILL PEOPLE!!! Ahem. These never got to come up in play, sadly, but they helped set the tone.<br/><br/>Our Focus was the tsar's favored concubine. Many of us had the interest of seeing the queen displaced and the concubine elevated to power above all the others. Our characters were a motley lot: the head of the orthodox church (played by me), the concubine's music teacher (and secret lover), her handmaiden, her tutor, and her brother the tailor.<br/><br/><strong>Notable Events</strong><br/><br/>In the first scene, I set the tutor up trying to convince the court of his outlandish (but true) astronomical theories. This was the first time I'd played with this group, and it was just really great to plop the Bird's character right down into the thick of it -- aggressive scene framing isn't something he's seen a whole lot of. The scene ended with a crowd booing him out of the room...but with the tsar silently impressed.<br/><br/>A big question was how the tailor was going to get involved in the court intrigues. So of course, we had a huge ball with fancy dresses--with some kind of knock-out powder secretted in his sister's (the concubine's) better-than-it-should-be gown. She upstages everyone, with some unfortunate consequences: The queen's personal eunuchs are dispatched to deal with her. Her handmaiden uses the sleeping powder to good effect though, and is able to get help.<br/><br/>The old tsar almost dies when -- in the same scene with the Eunuchs -- a PC accidentally knocks a huge sculpture/urn onto him. It was good to see, with this, some players really willing to dive in and grasp the Snake/Tiger authority. Outright death was viewed as a little extreme though, so his initial statement was retracted. Later, the tsar recovers after the tutor's auspicious astologizing -- another example of players doing something *cool* regardless of whether it helps them or not. Like in 1001 Nights, there's a certain kind of separation that keeops anyone from conflating his character's interests and the interests of the larger story.<br/><br/><strong>Single Best Thing About It</strong><br/><br/>This was a quick game; sort of chopped off after a few hours. No time now, but I think we could easily go back to it. No prep is pretty much required these days, so that worked great. Everyone said they had fun, but there was one huge highlight there:<br/><br/>One of the players was my friend's wife. She played D&amp;D and Shadowrun years ago and didn't like them. She listens to us play games regularly but hadn't participated until this game. I don't know why she decided to give it a shot, but she really dug it. In fact, since this game, she's role-played with us in every game we've done (!). After the game, she said something like, "I didn't know role-playing could be like that." Mission accomplished.                </div>

                            Awesome, Jasper!  I'm really interested in the Snake/Tiger dichotomy you've got going.  It really seems intriguing!                        </div>

                            That is turning out to be the major point of interest with the game. The main thing it enables is fairly free-wheeling ideas from the Snake, because he always knows the TIger won't let him get away with too much. Or, as Tony plays it, it allows the Snake (as befits his name) to make the Tiger do his dirty work for him by being REALLY helpful to the Bird.<br/><br/>So the Snake generally has more control than the Tiger, but the Tiger goes get the last word. In this last game, the "Tsar almost dies" bit was put in by the Tiger, not the Snake. And there was some concern, then, that the Tiger was too unchecked. But under a pretty solid group murmering, he demured and changed his statement. Really, everyone is checked because the meta-game cooperation is pretty high.                        </div>

                            Are there explicit rules and guidelines for that metagame cooperation, or is it an artifact of your playgroup?                        </div>

                            Nothing explicit. The Snake and Tiger's jobs are not described as autocratic positions, and I think the spirit of the game (as written) promotes cooperation.<br/><br/>Nothing says another group couldn't play differently. But...I don't know, it seems to come down to pretty basic social contract: "If everyone at the table thinks you're doing something stupid, you should probably listen to them." Would we have been really upset if the tsar had died? No, it would have been okay. But would I want to play with someone who never listens to my input on what he's doing? Not really. Would anyone?                        </div>
