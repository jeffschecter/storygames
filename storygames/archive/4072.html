I want to talk about RPGs played with large groups, particularly in classrooms etc. Suggestions, experience, game references, ideas etc are very welcome.<br/><br/>One Norwegian game designer has played RPGs in his class. About 20-30 students controlled a party of PCs (so there were probably around 4-5 students pr. PC). Good team decision training, I believe. <br/><br/>I'll be trying out a game idea for about 20 people in a few weeks. GM-less, distributed sort of thing. It's based on players picking interaction cards (from a stack) that instruct them to play out a particular type of scene - for instance, "Play out a romantic scene that ends in a jealous fight". They then go find another player to interact with, play out the scene, and get a new card. When the stack of cards is empty, the game is over. The stack can, of course, be programmed to make a semi-coherent story. I'll be combining this with a reward system where players get tokens from other players for good play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90889/#Comment_90889" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T05:38:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  5:38AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 5:38AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run a <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/icelandic_demo/icelandic_demo.pdf" rel="nofollow">classroom exercise</a> with six principal characters and, essentially, a jury that gets to debate based on the words and deeds of those characters.
