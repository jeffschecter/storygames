The depth has to do with the amount of published detail that you are expected to "account" for in some fashion.  <br/><br/>By "unique" I mean the setting is unique to that game, with no outside references or other media to refer to except those that might come after the game is released (e.g. Dragonlance novels).    It may be reminiscent of something else, but it is different enough that your knowledge of other settings may be more of a hindrance than a help.    A setting is more unique, I would argue, if there are specific rule mechanics that are tied into the setting, such as non-generic magic or skill systems, or cultural elements such as character classes.<br/><br/>(Forgive me if there are other, customary terms around here for these concepts.  I haven't been involved with Story Games for a long time.)<br/><br/>Classic examples of unique, deep settings, I think, would be Glorantha (Rune/Heroquest), Talislanta, World of Darkness, Planescape, Castle Falkenstein.    More recent examples might be Eclipse Phase, Numenera, Ashen Stars.<br/><br/>Unique, deep settings have been the rule in the past and probably still are for the majority of role-players.  But they have a lot of challenges.  Just the time commitment of actually reading all the material can be a challenge.   Also, the more detailed and unique the setting, the more likely there will be at least one element that you and/or some of the other players in your group don't enjoy.   Also, let's face it, as a game designer there is always the chance that your much beloved setting, which you have lashed like an anchor to the raft of your basic rules-set, will sink in the face of potential customer apathy, never to be seen again.  The halls of RPGGeek are littered with such artifacts.  <br/><br/>What makes you want to play such a game?  What makes you avoid it?   What are their advantages and disadvantages?<br/><br/>Extra credit question: As an RPG designer (both potential or actual), what criteria would you use to decide that your unique, deep setting has something special to offer, and is worth committing to paper/pdf and trying to sell to others?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428292/#Comment_428292" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-14T15:05:13+00:00" title="February 14, 2014  3:05PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2014 3:14PM by Irminsul.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is this: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12017/x" rel="nofollow">Big, Detailed Settings in Play</a>.

Often they'll be one setting guardian (usually the GM) who explains things as needed.<br/><br/>For example, I just started running Runequest (the late 70s version from Chaosium) in Glorantha and the default game assumptions are that the characters are 16 or so years old and have next to no knowledge about the world outside of where they grew up.  When I look at the Cults of Prax and Cults of Terror source books and the Griffin Mountain campaign setting, I see a lot of the setting stuff being put on the referee while the players get to learn about the setting through play.<br/><br/>I will post again shortly actually addressing what attracted me to start running a game in Glorantha after I give it some more thought, but I figured I'd ask about the "who needs to know the deep setting for play to actually work issue?" first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428296/#Comment_428296" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-14T20:56:45+00:00" title="February 14, 2014  8:56PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'll start with the "extra credit question." <br/><br/>I think a deep setting that might be sold to other people should probably have a means of entrance that does not require deep knowledge of the setting.  Like Glorantha in it's earliest publications.  The early Chaosium version of Runequest assumes relative ignorance by making starting characters not require deep knowledge of the world.  Also the early game products often revolved around one particular location or area, so I, as the refree, don't have to know everything about the world of Glorantha to run something like Snakepipe Hollow.<br/><br/>As for what attracted me to Glorantha, the answer to that is probably specific to the setting rather than universal to deep settings in general.  I am interested in folk religion, cults and anthropology far more than I am interested in say, dystopian transhumanism, so I'm interested in Glorantha and not Eclipse Phase.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm dancing around the edge of what you're really after, so I'm going to give this some more thought and then go read some Glorantha setting material and I'll report back what I enjoyed about the process and answer the rest of your questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428297/#Comment_428297" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-14T22:54:39+00:00" title="February 14, 2014 10:54PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think a deep setting that might be sold to other people should probably have a means of entrance that does not require deep knowledge of the setting.</blockquote>\nThis is fairly important to me, too; everyone I play with is at an age where free time is limited, and asking or expecting everyone at the table to have read a setting book (or even to have bought it) is just...not reasonable. One person definitely will (whoever is running the game), so whatever that setting is had better make it <i>really easy</i> for one person to explain everything important quickly. If one person can't explain it without struggling or if everyone needs to absorb a huge pile of information in order to understand how that world works, I'm out.<br/><br/>The other key element for getting me onboard with a unique, deep setting is for it to be in a genre I really like. My heart will not thrill at the possibility of playing in a fantasy setting, for example, but I'm an easy mark for a hard sci-fi universe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kingCrackers" title="kingCrackers"><img alt="kingCrackers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kingCrackers">kingCrackers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428298/#Comment_428298" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-15T03:32:10+00:00" title="February 15, 2014  3:32AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I feel that while I'll read book upon book about a setting, what I <i>really</i> like is improvising.<br/><br/>Give me a sketch of a vivid setting, a few of its problems, and I will build upon it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428300/#Comment_428300" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-15T09:05:15+00:00" title="February 15, 2014  9:05AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick question/point of clarification:<br/><br/>I think there's a difference between a <i>pre-built</i> unique, deep setting and creating a unique, deep setting, right?<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that Hans is asking about the pre-built version, where there's a ton of material that's already out there that has to be consumed (in one way or another) to justify using the material.

Empire of the Petal Throne went one step further and had the PCs be foreigners just arriving in the Empire.<br/><br/>As to the original question, I have always been attracted to these deep settings, but in actual play, it's best when I don't get caught up in most of the detail. Instead of taking everything that's printed as canon, I use bits as they seem relevant, or inspire me or a player, or just are featured in a module I might be using. I also find it best when the setting is no longer being expanded with new publications (because then if I riff off of something in one of the publications I don't run the risk of some future publication totally clashing with my riff).<br/><br/>I think there are also ways to have a pretty deep setting without running into some of these problems. Burning Wheel definitely has some deep setting implications in it's life paths (and other mechanics such as the resource mechanics), however, once actively playing, it's hard to actually break them unless you try.<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428363/#Comment_428363" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T20:55:32+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  8:55PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There is this: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12017/x" rel="nofollow">Big, Detailed Settings in Play</a>.

There have been some sandbox threads though, I learned about RuneQuest in one of them. For big, detailed settings, I have two things I think are important and I've probably posted all this stuff at some point before:<br/><br/>One is a conceptual framework that governs the whole setting, which has nothing to do with aesthetic (and specifically visual aesthetic) but has everything to do with situation and events. Like playing Planescape but keeping the theme of great power politics always in mind--so everything gets filtered through that lens of meaning. This is actually my go-to concept for Planescape style fantasy, and probably the reason why I immediately recognized Dark Heart of the Dreamer as the post-modern immigrant diaspora experience turned into a fantasy game where you play characters sort of like Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser.<br/><br/>Two is actual details that can be used in play. If a book's description of  villain is "he is very smart" I don't care, give me some actual schemes of his that are smart. Visual descriptions are fine and everything, but a setting really needs to be situations that the PCs can get into so that you can do the role-playing thing and not the book club discussion group thing (assuming you showed up to a role-playing game).<br/><br/>This is another important thing: Knowledge about a detailed setting, to me, is the same as knowledge about history (and, like Ken Hite is wont to say, the real world is the most detailed setting you can play in). If you use your own knowledge to invalidate the contributions to the game made by other players, it doesn't matter that they're not living up to your sense of verisimilitude, you're a dick. If you use your knowledge to make the game better, by giving other players details they can use and ignoring things that only you care are wrong, then you are a good player! So if you are writing a detailed setting, I think you should keep that in mind and have your setting help out with that.<br/><br/>As a designer, I have two considerations for everything: How much fun and how much money. I have a limited amount of time and effort I can spend on projects that don't give me some of both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans" title="Hans"><img alt="Hans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans">Hans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428371/#Comment_428371" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T07:08:45+00:00" title="February 18, 2014  7:08AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2014 7:42AM by Hans.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome replies, thanks!  Glad I provided an opportunity for thread necromancy.  I'll respond to a few tidbits, because there is too much to reply to more generally.<br/>Christopher said <blockquote>"I'm pretty sure that Hans is asking about the pre-built version, where there's a ton of material that's already out there that has to be consumed (in one way or another) to justify using the material. (Players reading it; GM dispensing it; dribbling it out over play.)  But this is different than playing and ending up with a unique, deep setting. It's even different than the GM creating a unique setting that is somewhat deep and get deeper with time.  Hans, am I right?"</blockquote>\nYes, Christopher, that was what I was talking about.  Also, why isn't block quote working for you, Christopher?  What have you done?!\n<blockquote>I tend to find a lot of these types of settings don't actually require players to know details.  Often they'll be one setting guardian (usually the GM) who explains things as needed.</blockquote>\nI sort of agree, frozenwastes, but sometimes not so much.  Take Glorantha for instance.  You tell a friend it's a fantasy game and he says "awesome, I want to play an elf!"  What he has in his head as to what an elf is, and what an elf is in Glorantha, probably don't mesh up very well, and the differences, I would argue, are crucial to making a Glorantha game a Glorantha game, and not just a fantasy game.  You are going to have to go a little ways, at least, to explain the differences.<br/><br/>Also, again using Glorantha as an example, the cultural detail of Glorantha is so wonderfully rich, it SHOULD inform character creation deeply, shouldn't it?  That is, why would you bother if you are going to just play the same characters you would have played in Dragonlance?<br/><br/>I agree with you and others, though, that you should focus on one small piece of the setting, not the whole thing at once.\n<blockquote>The other key element for getting me onboard with a unique, deep setting is for it to be in a genre I really like. My heart will not thrill at the possibility of playing in a fantasy setting, for example, but I'm an easy mark for a hard sci-fi universe.</blockquote>\nThat seems crucial, Accounting.\n<blockquote><b>P.S.</b> I just realized, I led off with the assumption that the GM created the setting.  So, I'll clarify: in situations where the GM <i>bought</i> the setting, the GM's fun is not in showing off "here's <i>what I made</i>" but rather "here's <i>how I used</i> the stuff others made".  So a good deep setting for <i>sale</i> had better be full of ways for the GM to make it their own.</blockquote>\nInteresting, David.  I agree with that in principle, but I wonder about that in practice.  If the GM is the only one familiar with the setting, who is the GM entertaining by making the setting his/her own?  Just his/herself?  That's not a bad thing, but it can be a bit...boring.  \n<blockquote>The same thing that makes me play any other game: good game design. A fun, awesome game to play. If your awesome game happens to also have a detailed setting attached to it, the quality of the game increases the odds that I will take your setting seriously and consider using it. This will be doubly true when it turns out that the excellent game you have made is excellent in part because it is intricately tied to the things that make your setting interesting and unique.</blockquote>\nI agree 100%, your Majesty.  The best deep setting games (unique or not) I have played or the ones that mechanically support the most interesting things in the setting.  I think this was a strength of all the World of Darkness games, and a major strength of a game like Weapons of the Gods.  It is the biggest problem with all the multitude of GURPS materials, especially things like GURPS Uplift or GURPS Discworld (which both SHOULD have strong mechanics for their unique features).\n<blockquote>This way of bootstrapping the setting of course was also used in the very first deep setting (Tekumel). Empire of the Petal Throne went one step further and had the PCs be foreigners just arriving in the Empire.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Burning Wheel definitely has some deep setting implications in it's life paths (and other mechanics such as the resource mechanics), however, once actively playing, it's hard to actually break them unless you try.</blockquote>\nI did not know that about Empire of the Petal Throne, Frank.  That is pretty cool.   Take it a step further and you have John Carter-ish Sword and Planet style setting; you don't know anything about the setting because you are from another planet!<br/><br/>I think life-path-ish mechanics are pretty useful for deep settings in general.  \n<blockquote><blockquote>There is this: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12017/x" rel="nofollow">Big, Detailed Settings in Play</a>. I think Johnstone really covers it for me (EDIT: apparently not in that thread though... hmmm). And this.</blockquote>\nThis is another important thing: Knowledge about a detailed setting, to me, is the same as knowledge about history (and, like Ken Hite is wont to say, the real world is the most detailed setting you can play in). If you use your own knowledge to invalidate the contributions to the game made by other players, it doesn't matter that they're not living up to your sense of verisimilitude, you're a dick.

More recent examples might be Eclipse Phase, Numenera, Ashen Stars.<br/><br/>Unique, deep settings have been the rule in the past and probably still are for the majority of role-players.  But they have a lot of challenges.  Just the time commitment of actually reading all the material can be a challenge.   Also, the more detailed and unique the setting, the more likely there will be at least one element that you and/or some of the other players in your group don't enjoy.   Also, let's face it, as a game designer there is always the chance that your much beloved setting, which you have lashed like an anchor to the raft of your basic rules-set, will sink in the face of potential customer apathy, never to be seen again.  The halls of RPGGeek are littered with such artifacts.  <br/><br/>What makes you want to play such a game?  What makes you avoid it?   What are their advantages and disadvantages?<br/><br/>Extra credit question: As an RPG designer (both potential or actual), what criteria would you use to decide that your unique, deep setting has something special to offer, and is worth committing to paper/pdf and trying to sell to others?</blockquote>\nThe key for me with any deep setting is whether it is interesting enough in itself to learn about. Regardless of whether the setting is from real life, a comic, a television series, or an RPG - the key question is whether it is fun to learn about. For example, if a game is set in 1630s London, and I have to read a bunch about 1630s London, then I'm probably fine because that is material that I enjoy reading. Likewise, if a game is set in media that I enjoy, like Star Trek - then I'm probably fine - because I'm happy to re-watch some Star Trek episodes. If it is set in media that I don't enjoy, then I would tend to avoid it. <br/><br/>For example, I've been a fan of Harn as a deep setting, because I was interested in the setting as written. I've considered Castle Falkenstein as well, though not the other examples you listed. <br/><br/>The obvious disadvantage is that there is a higher barrier to entry. The advantage is that one has more meaningful objects to create with. <br/><br/>There is a common criticism of deep settings that one is consuming the settings <i>instead of</i> creating. So, for example, if someone writes a novel set in real established history, it is less creative than writing a fantasy novel where the author makes everything up. I think this is completely off base. If I am running a game set in history, then we are still creating - the creation adds onto the already established details like what people wear, what people eat, and so forth. Likewise, if I set my game in Harn, we are concentrating on more subtle details - like how this individual worships Agrik, rather than what the religion is.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428394/#Comment_428394" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T16:27:40+00:00" title="February 18, 2014  4:27PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2014 4:33PM by Johnstone.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My words cannot be bound.</blockquote>\nReplace all spaces with underscores, and even the mightiest of the mighty can be bound!

Of course, the main reason I don't use other people\xb4s deep settings is because my memory is terrible and can't retain data in trivia form, unless it's emotionally related to something (a.k.a. a really good story)<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, I'd totally go for it if it was like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkworld" rel="nofollow">Orkworld</a> You see, this book features first a really great short story about a human who ends up learning the Ork way of living in a sorta "Dance with Wolves" way. Then there's a bunch of trivia and traditions about the setting that I think I could try to study to use, but that certainly I can't remember them right now. The last part is the best, featuring three or four hilarious stories about the Ork gods, that tell you even more about the setting than the whole trivia part.<br/><br/>I also have good (tough a bit confusing) memories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Engel</a> where the setting and monsters are presented through a chronicle of a traveler. It did a lot for me to flesh the atmosphere of the game in my mind, along with the amazing art.<br/><br/>However both the examples I mentioned leave enough open space for the GM to move in them. I'd actually play Orkwork with any OSR and right now I'm using the Engel atmosphere for my current Anima Campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428408/#Comment_428408" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T10:24:44+00:00" title="February 19, 2014 10:24AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2014 10:32AM by frozenwastes.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>I tend to find a lot of these types of settings don't actually require players to know details.

You are going to have to go a little ways, at least, to explain the differences.</blockquote>\nYou asked why I was interested and I added that setting knowledge doesn't have to be a barrier to entry and your response was to assume that there's an immediately mismatch of expectations?  Is your play regularly like that? That's not my experience at all.  Not in the past and not in the game I'm running right now.\n<blockquote>Also, again using Glorantha as an example, the cultural detail of Glorantha is so wonderfully rich, it SHOULD inform character creation deeply, shouldn't it?  That is, why would you bother if you are going to just play the same characters you would have played in Dragonlance?</blockquote>\nI'm actually running a Glorantha game right now using the 1980 Runequest 2nd edition and Glorantha is built right into the character creation.  You roll your social class and then have the opportunity to interact with cults, guilds and fraternities that make up the basis of the local culture.  In the Griffin Mountain supplement, you have "growing up" scenarios where the players go through various aspects of Balazaring culture as part of their character creation process.<br/><br/>Why did you ask me about about why I might play in a deep setting if you really want to talk about theoretical people being confused about Glorantha and Dragonlance?  Or does it only count as a deep setting if you can't play it without everyone at the table having extensive setting knowledge?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans" title="Hans"><img alt="Hans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans">Hans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428414/#Comment_428414" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T12:36:57+00:00" title="February 19, 2014 12:36PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2014 12:38PM by Hans.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You asked why I was interested and I added that setting knowledge doesn't have to be a barrier to entry and your response was to assume that there's an immediately mismatch of expectations?

Werewolf: the Apocalypse is one example where something very similar happened, Shadowrun is another.  You are right that a lot of settings, or maybe better to say particular groups of people using particular settings, do not have the sort of problem I have mentioned.  <br/><br/>I'm not saying their aren't ways around these situations, or ways to try to avoid them.  I guess all I was saying was that while I agree that sometimes the GM can be the "setting guardian" as you called it, sometimes they can't.   Sometimes, for the game to work the way it probably should for everyone to enjoy themselves the most, the players will have to invest some time and effort in understanding the setting. Those kind of experiences are one of the reasons I asked the questions in my first post.  That and feeling out whether or not it is worth the effort on my part to detail out some ideas I have for a deep setting into an actual book of some sort.  \n<blockquote>Why did you ask me about about why I might play in a deep setting if you really want to talk about theoretical people being confused about Glorantha and Dragonlance?  Or does it only count as a deep setting if you can't play it without everyone at the table having extensive setting knowledge?</blockquote>\nI don't want to talk about theoretical people, frozenwastes.  Forgive my throwaway illustration of a more general point, which is I would think a big chunk of the enjoyment of playing in a deep setting would be making characters thoroughly of that setting, characters that really live and breathe the setting and fit right in.  But that's a bit of a distraction from my original question, so again, my apologies.  Mostly I was just making conversation.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with 1980's Runequest (although I remember owning a copy at one point) so I accept and find it interesting that its character creation system guides players into the setting and helps them select characters that are harmonious with that setting.  That's cool.  That sort of thing, a detailed character creation system that leads people into the setting naturally, would certainly attract me to a deep setting for a game.  That goes a long way towards obviating the need for the players to do "independent study" of the setting themselves.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428416/#Comment_428416" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T14:00:32+00:00" title="February 19, 2014  2:00PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Re: blockquotes, since the software change, S-G only recognizes usernames without spaces.

I'm talking here about a sample group of about 60 non-theoretycal people, who have played several different D&amp;D deep settings and the whole WoD. 4/5 of these people have expressed strongly against players making independent study of the setting, at least beyond whatever their characters could possibly know given their backgrounds, for it ruins the excitement of discovery and exploration they will get while navigating the setting. Not to mention they will most probably do this study only to prepare for upcoming challenges through meta-gaming means.<br/><br/>For players -statistically- the independent study of the setting will actually take effect while playing or after a few sessions, but not before. Except for the GM, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428433/#Comment_428433" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T23:22:54+00:00" title="February 19, 2014 11:22PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's an aspect of Castle Falkenstein (and also of Blue Rose -- and Star Trek, come to think of it) that makes me want to run it a particular way, although I've never actually done so (or run any of these three)). That is that I want to look at some of the assumptions and undercut them.<br/><br/>In Castle Falkenstein, it occurred to me that we're getting pretty much one guy's viewpoint, and he's a guy from our world who fell in with one particular crowd of heavy hitters. What if we look at the world from the point of view of someone (I was thinking a woman, but the gender swap isn't necessary) who wound up on the streets, and not with the cool folks? With Blue Rose, I was interested in the neighboring country that's a theocracy and looked on with such condescension by the good guy country -- which also happens to have better land and better luck, or in a campaign about the less than shiny people who have to keep the country running, the ones who do the dirty work so the rest of the good guy country can pretend it doesn't exist.<br/><br/>This isn't the only thing that draws me to settings. I'd be fine with a shiny game of Castle Falkenstein or Blue Rose. I loved exploring Glorantha when a friend who'd been gaming for at least as long as there had been a published version of the world agreed to run HeroQuest. I've had a couple of amazing convention games of Pendragon.<br/><br/>But, there is definitely an attraction for me of "Okay, so what's the part we're not being told?" or, for something based on a show like Star Trek, "What if the script writers didn't insist on certain types of stupidity or amnesia (like things that are useful in one episode and then are never dealt with again)?" The latter is also "How _we'd_ do it better", which is fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
