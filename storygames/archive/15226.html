What you proposing is an intellectual exercise, with next to no emotional investment in character. That is, to me, a dull place to be. I'm not overly fond of the character polygamy of a lot of modern games. In this instance it would totally kill my objective. The agenda of tapping into the soul of the oppressor, would be null and void if executed in the manner you propose.</i><br/><br/>I suspect that a lot of players really feel as I do; a safe distance between player and character is not something they enjoy; they find it dull. So when trying modern games of the type Robert describes, after the first rush of hacing all threads in their hands, and doing what they want with them ... after this a great portion of players realize that they miss something ...<br/>- they miss out on the really heartbreaking relationship with their character; identifying with it, and sharing in its successes and failures. <br/><br/>Looking at it from a safe distance is not quite the same.<br/><br/>So, to be a bit cheeky here; I propose for the kind of play Robert is propagating, to be games made by and for people who are very much dependent on keeping inside their comfort zone. Having an intellectual exercise is fine and fun, but having emotional investment is potentially disturbing, and to be avoided.<br/><br/><b>Character polygamy ensures aloofness!</b><br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346181/#Comment_346181" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T01:02:40+00:00" title="October 16, 2011  1:02AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love my aloofness.<br/><br/>There.

It's fun, sure, but at best I'm only getting to do one or two things with any particular scene, and the nature of switching between characters keeps me thinking in big-picture mode rather than really sinking my teeth into the scene I'm in right now.  But when I'm a player and I have <i>my</i> character, it's like being the star character in my own little movie: I can figure out who that guy is, what he talks like, how he moves; I can try to portray more complicated and nuanced reactions with him; he can have long-term plans and change over time.  All of that is really entertaining and fulfilling play for me, the same way that playing Hamlet on stage is more fulfilling than playing Elsinore Guard <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>I'm not gaming to get some kind of emotional catharsis (I also get enough of that in real life) or to push my emotional boundaries (again, plenty of that in real life) or to explore and experience disturbing emotional situations (real life too, sadly): I'm gaming because pretending to be these characters in these games is fun, and because getting to act around a table with friends is a ridiculously good time and much easier to arrange and more flexible than acting on stage.<br/><br/><br/>I think that one of the very best things about this hobby is that it is big enough and varied enough to encompass what I and my friends like to do as well as whatever it is the rest of you people enjoy.

The characters may have several social skills (there's 5 in all), and each skill is linked to one particular part of society. <br/><br/>And each skill is, at the convenience of the players, an expression of one particular aspect of the character. The aspects may be translated, crudely, into <i>Bravado</i> (physical), <i>Flirt</i> (sensual) and <i>Conversation</i> (intellectual).<br/><br/>So the character may have up to three different social skills (of the 5 available), each linked to a different part of society, and each of them supporting the character in expressing him/herself in a special way.<br/><br/>I find such things far more interesting than any discussion of "character polygamy", which I only invented to say something about that dreadful term; "character monogamy".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346409/#Comment_346409" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T16:20:35+00:00" title="October 18, 2011  4:20PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Character monogamy" should be reserved for the extreme cases of My Guy Syndrome, the very worst ones, in which people respond to criticisms of or misfortunes that befall their character as if they befell their real-life spouse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346413/#Comment_346413" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T17:22:26+00:00" title="October 18, 2011  5:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a game at a con. The game was Godlike, so pretty traditional structure. There were 8 characters and 6 players. Two players were asked to take on two extra characters, and they did.  Those extra characters were definitely second fiddles. They weren't characterized as much (or rather, their characterizations were very solitary and isolating).<br/><br/>I was playing a fight pilot captain. Another player was playing my wingman. It was established we were buddies.<br/><br/>4 hours into the game, two of the players realized they were double booked, and the other game was short on players. They left. The two of us with only one character took on their characters. Now I was playing two characters.<br/><br/>It was awesome. First, because the guy I started with wasn't so hot when it came down to combat rolls. The other character had an amazing ability for his plane's guns. Second, because I was able to have them play off each other more and plan some combo moves (the guy playing him previously was great, but we were sitting across the table so it was hard to interact without taking the spotlight to do it). There was nothing big or dramatic that changed wither mechanically or from the story as a result (like I said the other player was great).<br/><br/>I get emotionally invested creating a story. The number of characters takes second place to that fact. It turns out this holds true even in games and situations where I wouldn't expect it to work (as in my example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346446/#Comment_346446" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-19T07:52:18+00:00" title="October 19, 2011  7:52AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At some point Tomas I do intend to give you a more proper reply that isn't simply a cheeky one-liner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346447/#Comment_346447" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-19T08:00:26+00:00" title="October 19, 2011  8:00AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2011 8:00AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cheeky one-liners are quite in tune whit this thread!

Te last couple posts looked at things in an entirly different light than i was thinking, actually. I've been thinking more in terms of playing multiple characters, some more shallowly, and also having noncharacter input into the game.<br/><br/>I'll have to mull over those concepts more.<br/><br/>Tomas<br/><br/>In terms of engagement and interest, I have great fun playing with a bit of character polyamory.<br/><br/>However, as regards your comments on playing within a safe emotional space, well, frankly, yes.<br/><br/>While I will certainly dip into character and game play beyond simple shoot 'em up type entertainment, I personally have no great desire to go deeply into the mindset of being some character in a truly appaling situation and experiencing it as close to first hand as possible.<br/><br/>At most, i might want to experience it the way i experience the emotion of watching a tear jerker film. Most times, not even that.<br/><br/>As for what most players want?<br/><br/>Who can say? My experience has been that most players I've met prefer mostly to portray a character that they've created that is largely a combination of traits of other characters from popular adventure fiction of some sort, perhaps combining the portaryals by a couple of different well-known actors if the source characters were from film ( or the equivalent from books, comics, or animated features).<br/><br/>Occasionally, they'll attempt to offer non-character ideas and work them into play, but since the majority of games aredesigned to filter htis sort of thing through a GM authority figure, the longer they game, the less likely they are to offer those sorts of asides either about their character or setting or situation in favor of strictly self-limiting themselves to character portrayal.<br/><br/>In that, I simply see a feedback cycle and example of self-selection, not any particular large scale trend.<br/><br/>Well, maybe a trend of sorts.

Jason you own. <br/><br/>For my two cents: I've had the deepest character involvement in games where I've had the highest number of characters to field. In the <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=580" rel="nofollow">6 year improvsed system</a> Ars Magica campaign I played with Vincent &amp; Meg Baker, I had more investment in minor characters even,  than I've had in many short term trad or hippy games that only asked me to play just one. But I spent waaaaay more time in character in this campaign and others like it than in any of the latter.<br/><br/>I've also loved games where I've had very little investment in my own character (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=16744.0" rel="nofollow">Blue Lines</a> still stands as one of my favorite games, but I barely did anything and felt little connection with the cartoon unicorn mascot I played). This isn't the same as character involvement though. <br/><br/>Perhaps <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=18449.0" rel="nofollow">The Hare and Hound</a>, is a better example for that. My character was a bastard, covering for the crimes of Jack the Ripper and generally acting as a foil. And my screen time was short. But I loved playing that character, and feel strongly about him and the game still.<br/><br/>The depth of your connection and investment in a character will either be a function of 1) the time and depth of exploration you spend with that character or 2) the compatibility or fulfillment that a character &amp; a game give you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346634/#Comment_346634" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T23:41:08+00:00" title="October 21, 2011 11:41PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2011 11:53PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My play style varies between polyamorous leatherdyke and transsexual gear queer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346636/#Comment_346636" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-22T00:18:49+00:00" title="October 22, 2011 12:18AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mostly in various degrees of masochist-polyroly mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore" title="Nicholas Moore"><img alt="Nicholas Moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore">Nicholas Moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347008/#Comment_347008" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T16:15:13+00:00" title="October 26, 2011  4:15PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, new here, wanted to weigh in:  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that I desire a strong attachment to a character.  Especially if there is an expectation of logetivity in the game.  I also feel that the playing only one character allows for the illusion of potential immersion as well as an artificial attachment bred by choice.  By closing off other characters one could of played, one feels that the character left brings with it a special relationship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI recently played Blowback and was surprised by how much fun the process of creating multiple characters was.  I was also surprised by the investment I had in a) both my agent and civilian, and b) the characters I created as their respective relationships.  I believe what helped me overcome my desired character monogamy was that Blowback implied (as I read into it) a prioritization of characters.  It was like it told me: "Yes, you can be attached to your agent, but look, don't you also want to be attached to this civilian?"  I think in the end forcing my investment in an array of character--some I would play, some I wouldn't--was some of best results that game gave me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_347030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347030/#Comment_347030" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T23:22:30+00:00" title="October 26, 2011 11:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting experience, Nicholas.

I didn't want to have to constantly force situations where the priestess and the CAG were in the same room just to give everyone enough playing time. Instead, I had each person create a primary character and two significant people in that character's life. The significant people then became other people's alt characters. I thought a lot about a system for deciding who got which alt character, but it turned out that with about 30 minutes of discussion, everyone was happy with their choices. It generally worked out fairly well. People occasionally became more involved with their alts than their mains, but as long as they were emotionally involved with something, that was fine with me. We had a couple false steps where players ended up with their mains too close to someone else's alts, allowing them to give themselves orders, but we made one character change and did a little handwaving and it stopped being a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe campaign was awkward because of a general mismatch in expectations between me and some of the players, but I think the polygamy worked well and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again, if it made sense in the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore" title="Nicholas Moore"><img alt="Nicholas Moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas%20Moore">Nicholas Moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347074/#Comment_347074" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T12:49:18+00:00" title="October 27, 2011 12:49PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2011 12:50PM by Nicholas Moore.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,   <br>\n   We had some difficulty with Blowback's rules as they pertained to flow, structure, and conflict resolution, and unfortunately those of us who were playing have been unable to revisit the game since.  But as far as having two characters to play around with, the game certainly succeeded.  We the players were significantly more invested in all of our characters I would have expected.  Furthermore,  in Blowback you each play an Agent (read: spy/assassin) and a civilian; this lead to a pre-established grouping of possible relationships: agent to civilian, agent to agent, and civilian to civilian.  In this way it felt easier to handle (and invest) in multiple characters, because I had a sense of what kinds of relationships I could play into.  <br>\n<br/>\nIt might be important to note the Blowback is a game about relationships and the consequences to those relationships backlisted spies doing under-the-table-jobs suffer.  I would highly recommend checking it out if the genre appeals to you.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_347086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347086/#Comment_347086" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T15:36:09+00:00" title="October 27, 2011  3:36PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2011 4:20PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason; I like the way you did it.

You can either ask someone to do something for you (applying strain) or do something for them (relieving strain).  The nature of the something determines the value applied to the relationship, small to moderate favors count for 1-2, while large favors count for 3-4.  Also, certain acts (not favors) can impact the same way, like exposing someone to danger or leaving a mess in their apartment.<br/><br/>When a relationship has as much strain as it's value, that person won't do any more favors for you until you relieve some strain.  Between jobs, players can adjust the value of relationships as they see fit, or even write down new ones gained.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347213/#Comment_347213" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T06:45:59+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  6:45AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blowback is an excellent example. The relationship you as a player have with your spy is enriched by the relationship you have with your civilian. <br/><br/>Relationships. Polygamy. This is sounding very much like a different realm, isn't it? I respectfully submit an alternative terminology: <b>one-to-one</b> and<b> one-to-many</b>, player to character. That could be extended to situations where many players play many characters: <b>many-to-many</b>. <br/><br/>Many-to-many is fairly unusual, but need not be. I imagine that would make character identification somewhat diluted--though again, that would depend on the time and quality of exploration given to the in-character relationship. One-to-one is of course a standard of play for "Players" in traditionally structured games (e.g. D&amp;D, White Wolf etc.). One-to-many is standard for GMs, and is used in certain games, like Blowback, Microscope and Ars Magica. <br/><br/>Games could have mixed usage: for example, players could have a one-to-one relationship with their Mages, while having a many-to-many relationship with Grogs or Covenfolk. GMs sharing out NPCs would change a game with the standard Player 1:1/GM \u221e:1, to a \u221e:\u221e game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347227/#Comment_347227" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T09:29:33+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  9:29AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2011 8:57PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to add my two cents.<br/><br/>The number of characters I'm playing doesn't effect the amount I give a shit about them. Maybe because I GM alot or many because I'm a writer or maybe because I do sociological work, whatever the reason dealing with multitudes with care for them as individuals and as a group is something that comes easily. I care about the characters I care about. When I'm GMing/MCing/STing, I never generate characters I don't care about emotionally. I think if it does happen, it's because I'm tried and cranky. So, Jim the NPC becomes the fictionalization of my not giving a care.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the many-to-many model in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember Tomorrow</span>.

What has been your experience with the stress mechanic of Blowback?  I found it viscerally operated on the existing attachment to the relationships I had formed during character creation.  That is to say, character creation in Blowback did a great job making me care about my character's relationships, to the point that I as a player was moved and made anxious when stress was applied to them.  However, as mentioned, my experience with Blowback is limited, so I'd love to hear other perspectives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily Care,  <br/>\n  Could you point to any games that use the many-to-many model?

Remember Tomorrow has many-to-many, which I'd forgotten. Characters are created, then in play each person can pick one or several to involve in a scene. Dirty Secrets was also mentioned, which I've not played yet. Other games I know of include Spione, which is non-standard in many ways; Universalis, which has an economy that regulates others usage of characters; and Microscope, which has strong creative input by all the players, but little individual ownership of any of the elements once they are introduced into play.<br/><br/>I was in a campaign where some less central characters were intentionally played by multiple players. Mostly this was fine, but occasionally there were major differences between the players about some central aspect of the character: the sexual orientation of the stable hand became something of a struggle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347375/#Comment_347375" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T09:13:11+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  9:13AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite> Mostly this was fine, but occasionally there were major differences between the players about some central aspect of the character: the sexual orientation of the stable hand became something of a struggle.</blockquote>\nHey Emily, could you expand upon this example?

They can fit one character in it. They can switch out characters as they wish, but when the character is in your slot, you own it, no questions. You can play any character not in another player's slot. So it has the option of as much polygamy as you like, but with a definite option for character ownership. It is actually my favorite model for Gm-less play out there, even if I am not as much a fan of the resolution system as I am of others. <br/><br/>I would love to write a game with the turn taking/scene setting/character sharing and ownership model of Remember tomorrow, with a more crunchy resolution and reward system from a different game. Wushu, Lady Blackbird, Dogs. Those are my favorite resolution systems. Fate, Lady Blackbird/TSOY, Dogs. Those are my favorite advancement/reward systems. A hack that allowed the turn taking/scene setting/character sharing and ownership model of Remember tomorrow requires quick built characters though, so I am not sure how I would get all that goodness in TSOY/Blackbird or Dogs into that game. I keep obsessing about it though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347505/#Comment_347505" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T06:56:02+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  6:56AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/nameless">@nameless</a> &amp; other Remember Tomorrow players:<br/><br/>what kind of play do you see emerging from these rules?<br/>does it collapse to 1-1 ownership or you notice a genuine rotation of ownership over the main characters?<br/>how does it affect the game and the stories that are generated?<br/><br/>--i.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347508/#Comment_347508" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T07:03:12+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  7:03AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It has mostly been 1-1 player ownership, except when someone has a cool idea for a character or sees a cool character that is unclaimed, then switches out for it. There have also been some jockeying for ownership when this happens. Someone lets go of their character to lay claim to another, then someone picks up the abandoned character, and the abandoning player gets jealous. It at times is like what happens in a large group of friends who date each other. There can be some jealousy when switches are made. It can add to the antagonism in the game at times.

I really, really like MtM designs but I'm interested in how things like that go down, like a sort of collectively contested stakes question. Struggle in a productive and amicable way? Or like hurt feelings away from the table way?</blockquote>\nOrly: The multiple handling of the stable hand (Avis) was the exception. There were many characters played by the three of us that worked well. A guard, Illysium, showed different sides when one or the other of us played her. She nearly involved the covenant in conflict with a nearby town when one person felt she shouldn't back down from an insult (to the covenant). I remember thinking that wouldn't have been my reaction--so surprises from different players for sure. <br/><br/>Avis was French, and was imagined as a ladies' man at the start. Extremely chivalrous, and fell for widow in the town. An (even more so) npc stole here though (figuratively) so poor Avis was left looking for love. Another player saw his plight as revealing more about him, and was interested in seeing express or explore homosexuality. Totally fine in the game and with the players generally, but it didn't fit with how the others of us had seen the character initially. And we weren't working together to transition for the poor fellow. <br/><br/>So he kind of hit a dead end. None of us knew what to do with him. Since we had different agendas for him, he couldn't move forward in his life. Towards the end of the game, I recall that someone had him thinking about leaving the covenant. It makes sense to me now in a sort of meta-down-to-the-fiction way. The story failed for him.<br/><br/>The differences weren't of a personal nature. No one was angry over it. Though there were tense moments at other times over less important (more important?) things, like the layout of the town. But I recommend being sure not to play too late at night to help avoid such differences. The issue with Avis was an aesthetic issue, that we failed to find a way to come to terms with together. But we really were winging it. There were no stakes involved, there was not structure for him. We had purely narratively defined characters, fleshed out through play over years, bumping into a world we created inch by inch in the same way. <br/><br/>During the game, we occasionally used mechanics and principles to help us through contests (fighting a dragon, a horse race) but for most things (including magic, social interactions and major politicking) we used our intuitive sense of what felt right. Vincent talks about one moment when this fell flat for us and how we saved it: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=8232" rel="nofollow">adventures in improvised system</a>.<br/><br/>As far as struggle in a productive way, it's funny but I've seen that happen with systems where that is the point of the mechanics: things like Shock: where you're pulling people's input into a conflict to see how it will be changed and escalated. But in the kind of really in-depth, MtM play that the long term freeform campaign was, usually the most productive pieces came from us adding to what the others had built, rather than being at odds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347533/#Comment_347533" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T09:11:23+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  9:11AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, in Avis' case, would it have made sense to roll a die to decide which version of reality became true or was it ok to let it end like it did?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15226/character-polygamy-is-it-dull-with-null-emotional-investment" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15226/character-polygamy-is-it-dull-with-null-emotional-investment" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15226/character-polygamy-is-it-dull-with-null-emotional-investment/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15226%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15226%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
