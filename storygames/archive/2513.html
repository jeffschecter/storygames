What we have so far:<br/>Breakfast:<br/>--Bagels and cream cheese (lox and tomato and onion if you want)<br/>--Pancakes<br/><br/>Lunch/Dinner:<br/>--Spaghetti (w/meatballs on the side)<br/>--Foil dinners (what are these, exactly?)<br/>--Sandwiches<br/>--Falafels<br/>--Fajitas/Burritos<br/>--Soup and grilled cheese/other sandwich<br/>--BBQ stuff (meat, veggies, potatoes) if there is a grill available<br/><br/>Dessert:<br/>--S'mores!<br/>--Rice krispy squares<br/><br/>Please give other suggestions!  These are technically enough to do one for each meal, but it's silly if you don't like what's being offered.  Personally, I'm not a fan of sandwiches.  Grilled cheese is okay, but sandwiches are icky.  Thus, I have added falafels.<br/><br/>It's actually much easier if we share food, because then we're not competing for campfire cooking time, we only dirty one set of dishes, and if you cook, someone else has to clean up!<br/><br/>Discussion: Begin!<br/><br/>--Nancy (Food Maven)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
