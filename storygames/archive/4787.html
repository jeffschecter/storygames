We are down to Pooka, his wife Louise and their old friend Liz as players, and me as the GM.<br/><br/>We met briefly once before this session to talk about background and \u201clook\u201d of the game, where we came up with this:<br/>Game is set in Edinburgh, of course, and I immediately thought of my friend Malcolm, who besides being a game designer also delves into urban exploration. A while ago he visited an derelict cold war underground bunker near where I live, and I suggested the bunker as the group\u2019s headquarter, which everyone liked. Malcolm shot some really creepy, evocative images from inside the place, which were great as well. Basically it\u2019s a three-level underground ROTOR radar bunker of which the top level was a WWII fighter control bunker. There\u2019s some info and pictures here:<br/><a href="http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=16446" rel="nofollow">http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=16446</a><br/><br/>The dreamworld is a mono-colour toned deserted landscape with strange physics and dimensions, scattered with great mausoleums and huge mud flats. There are scaffoldings with containers filled with people. Sometimes the dream loops over and over again. The aliens are tall and two-dimensional, looking like black and white projections of news reels from earth\u2019s history.<br/><br/>Our group of survivors is a resourceful one, and they have made great use of the location, by even getting an old generator running on alcohol made from potatoes, and broadcasting to other survivors via their own pirate radio station.<br/> <br/>Their grown-up leader is Elspeth McClaverty, a former farmer and land owner with brain damage from a riding accident. Elspeth is a little uncool, old and with a fucked up short-term memory.<br/><b><br/>Pilots</b><br/>Elijah, played by Pooka, 17-year-old angry seasoned veteran who recently lost his little brother.<br/>Fay, played by Louise, also 17. An innocent sweetheart, sweet, friendly and prone to problems.<br/>Oscar, played by Liz, 15, narcissistic bisexual carefree hedonist.<br/><br/><b>Anchors</b><br/>Tony, a likeable, techie radio guy. Tony is kind.<br/>Maria, 15, a well-read, super intellingent, loud, big girl. Maria is savvy.<br/>Michael Anderson, 16, a wanna-be pilot who couldn\u2019t cope with piloting. Michael Anderson is experienced.<br/><br/><b>Secondary characters</b><br/>Grizzly, 10, who defected from \u201cthe cannibals\u201d, another surviving group in Edinburgh.<br/>Gwyn, 15. Former Judi champion, risk taker. She was involved in Elijah\u2019s brother\u2019s disappearance.<br/>Clint, 17. The farm hand, the loner, the isolated practical guy.<br/><br/>The Edinburgh cell\u2019s hopes are\u2026<br/>\u2026that we can make a better civilization<br/>\u2026that we win a decisive battle<br/><br/>Character generation in BS is a great collaborative effort, where everyone is bouncing ideas of each other, constantly. All these teenagers grew out of a discussion and then somebody said \u201cOh, he must be a pilot! She\u2019s totally an Anchor!\u201d etc. It wasn\u2019t until towards the end of the session we decided who were actually going to play which character. We all liked this process very much. Liz did arrived in a bad mood, and it turned out that she was fearing that she was going to endure a classic old-school chargen session where you have to come up with exciting things and details about the character you are going to play, and then never use them ever again in actual play. Needless to say, she was in a much better mood afterwards.<br/><br/>\u2026end of transmission                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107693/#Comment_107693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T11:53:55+00:00" title="November 10, 2007 11:53AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Transmission received loud and clear Edinburgh cell!

So, not to undermine that effort, but rather to bolster it with a different format, I have the recording of last night's session in <a href="http://www.zshare.net/audio/519934276cbe47/" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.zshare.net/audio/5199331472d530/" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a>.<br/><br/>Hope I'm not jumping the gun here, Per, but I just uploaded the files and wanted to post it everywhere it needs postin' before I run off to work.

Mainly because we've left a couple of weeks (3?) between the last character generation session and this, and we were all a bit "What? Huh? We agreed what?", plus we forgot most of the rules and regulations as well, plus of course the normal pre-roleplaying creative angst or uncertainty, at least for my part.<br/><br/>So it was a sloooow first mission with a bit too little colour and description (imagine me saying that) - I'm curious how It'll be actually listening to the recording.<br/><br/>BUT! We have great, GREAT characters to play, we just don't know them yet. And players, of course.
