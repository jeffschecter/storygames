"It's too complicated" - this is the most common argument. For example, during a Duel of Wits, one player said "it takes too long." It was a big argument, about a big issue. It shouldn't resolve immediately. A couple beliefs and relationships were caught up in it, so it made sense to squeeze out the drama.<br/><br/> I've tried to explain that once we get it all down, scripting will be as second nature as flanking with a rogue. They aren't really believing me, and I don't know why. I've read the core book cover to cover, and re-read almost everything at least once. I don't have the best memory, so I have to keep looking things up. I'm doing my damnedest, but it's just a steep learning curve. <br/><br/>2. I've got people reading when they aren't on screen. This drives me crazy. I don't see why what the other characters are doing isn't interesting. I can't figure out if things just haven't gotten going yet, or if I'm screwing something up, or what. <br/><br/>Anyway, this is obviously very vague, but I'm hoping for some advice. I've promised that if it doesn't click by next session, we'll switch games, but I really don't want to. I've invested a lot of time into trying to learn these rules. SotC was a little bit difficult to pick up, but they all got it. I'm hoping that'll happen here too. <br/><br/>Basically, I'm looking for any advice on how I could better explain the crunch of the system. Or something.  Honestly, I don't really know what I'm looking for, and I apologize for that. I'm a little agitated, and it's making it difficult to explain myself.<br/><br/><br/>On a side note, if BW doesn't work out, any recommendations for a "simpler" but still story-gamish system I could transplant my world too?<br/><br/><br/>I'd be happy to answer any questions in a more concrete way. It will probably help my thought process to do so, as well as give you all more data to work with. <br/><br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169020/#Comment_169020" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T20:54:11+00:00" title="September 14, 2008  8:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to hear about your troubles Ryan.<br/><br/>I've only run one BW Campaign which lasted about 10 sessions, but it was one of the best gaming experiences of my life.<br/><br/>The system is very difficult, and the difficulty can of course get in the way of the actual gaming at times.

Assuming that's what you mean, I will try that. I had kind of planned to, but they seem a bit like a waste of paper. I could script twenty or so times on blank paper, but only once on these. However, if it will help in the interim, they might be a good idea.<br/><br/>I created the world myself. A lot of the stuff in it is supposed to be "secret, find out about it way-later" stuff, which they really like. I guess I will have to talk to them about what is keeping them from being interested right now though, and do my best to alleviate that. They have so many good beliefs and relationships that I just can't imagine why they don't already feel tied in to the fiction.<br/><br/>Thanks a lot!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169025/#Comment_169025" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T21:33:25+00:00" title="September 14, 2008  9:33PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I just started playing BW (as a player) and my initial raction was less-than-positive as well.<br/><br/>I thought that DoW was incredibly complex for what it was.<br/><br/>I really didn't like the whole compromise thing, especially since I didn't feel that those stakes were set out well ahead of time.<br/><br/>I thought it was way too simmy where gaining initial skills was concerned and chargen was a bloody labyrinth.<br/><br/>Further, I'm playing solo/1:1 and that seems non-viable for character effectiveness.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that I like the GM and the setting, I'd probably never engage with this game again.

We really, really enjoy it, but it's quite possible that your group doesn't. From you post, I get the feeling that they're being defensive about the system. I also get the feeling that you're trying to impose the system on them. I might be wrong, of course.<br/><br/>We get up, chat and browse magazines when were not on scene, and it's usually trouble at all. Why is this an issue? What I can tell you is that a BW should be going in about five seconds. Swords are drawn, affronts are made and you can feel the tension in the air.  You should notice it. If you're two sessions in and nothing's happening, there's something missing from your game. Perhaps it's the situation, perhaps the beliefs, perhaps the gaming group. To find out, we're going to need some more info (I guess they'll ask you the same thing over at the BW forums).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169029/#Comment_169029" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T22:12:57+00:00" title="September 14, 2008 10:12PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2008 10:13PM by noclue.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>I could script twenty or so times on blank paper, but only once on these. However, if it will help in the interim, they might be a good idea.<br/></blockquote>I think scripting on blank paper is a big part of your problem. Scripting becomes second nature much more quickly when you're coloring in the same bubbles and have the reference material at hand. Also, don't let the players think too long while scripting. Its supposed to move fast and you don't get a hell of a lot of strategic benefit from incessant hand wringing. A little good natured bullying to speed them along may be in order. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>one player said "it takes too long."</blockquote>It may be a stupid question, but they are roleplaying the argument not just scripting? I love me a good argument, but just scripting could get boring.<br/><br/>Similarly, don't let them doddle looking for skills to add dice to their rolls. If it fits, bring it in. But no shopping. Watching someone shop for bene's is not fun.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>I've got people reading when they aren't on screen.</blockquote>Are you pushing helping dice and linked contests?<br/><br/>You're probably doing this, but make sure the stakes of a DOW are something people care about. Don't go to duel of wits unless the players care (and if the beliefs are engaged, then they should care about those).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>I don't have the best memory, so I have to keep looking things up. I'm doing my damnedest, but it's just a steep learning curve.</blockquote>Don't do it all at once. Use what you can grasp at first and add to it. Use versus tests for everything, with a DOW thrown in when appropriate. The full BW sessions I've played in had maybe 2-3 DOWs and one Range and Cover, maybe a circles test or two.

Circles and Wises may get in the way. In my experience, it's much better to have everything out in the open when you're playing this game.<br/><br/><br/>The rules function w/ no problems. It's pretty much only fluff that's been altered. For example, the game actually takes place about 15,000 years from now - actually, 15k years from after the Large Hadron Collider created its first black hole, which killed most everyone, created the legendary Fields of Glass (by acting like a gigantic nuke), altered the laws of physics, and ripped holes through the quantum foam, allowing elves, dwarves, orcs, etc to come to "this" world. Probably, they will never know this. I'll be the first to say it's a little silly, so I don't know if anyone but you guys and myself will ever know it. It does color things though.

After a year of playing, we still hadn't gotten our heads around the full-on combat system. If I were to start again, I would heartily recommend this advice (which others have already given you): <b>Do not start with the full system; start only with the basic test format described in the first section of the book.</b><br/><br/>Of absolutely prime importance is that you and your play group get strong familiarity with the Artha fate-point-and-experience system and get it woven into your play at a fundamental level <i>before</i> you attempt to move on to putting the more detailed conflict systems into play.<br/><br/>By not layering the more complex systems on immediately, you will learn how the economic engine of the game works, and how to more effectively set stakes and consequences for conflicts. From reading the book (even though the book pretty much bluntly gives this recommendation itself), you may not believe this to be the case. BW provides these richly detailed systems for resolving conflict, so you think, what the heck: this is the full experience, right? With all these wonderful options, my players won't be happy resolving entire bloody conflicts with a single die roll!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's exactly the fundamental matter behind BW: it's absolutely vital that you get an effective handle on setting stakes for conflict, and getting the Artha system to become second nature to you.<br/><br/>Without that firm grounding, you won't get the approach required to use the more complex resolution mechanics in the best way: the advanced combat mechanics might <i>seem</i> very simulationist or tactical, but they are not. What they are is a complex set of options you can use to address conflict at a high-level narrative way: if you haven't already got a good handle on scene and stakes-setting, then your approach to these rules will be much harder.<br/><br/>My players never got their heads around this and in the end it brought our campaign to its knees. (For what it's worth, our group's players still are uncomfortable with high-level stake-setting-based conflict systems: we moved to using <i>Reign</i> last year, and suffered very similar problems because our gaming group just doesn't seem to "get" narrative play.)<br/><br/>What can you try if BW just isn't for you? If you want fantasy with a similar Sword-N-Sorcery feel, then I would suggest you try "Shadows of Yesterday" or "In A Wicked Age". Both of these games are much simpler to engage with than BW, and have the same narrative approach to gaming. I would also highly recommend HeroQuest, especially the forthcoming new edition of HeroQuest (which is more generic and not tied to the Glorantha background that some people quite like and others don't at all).<br/><br/>Another bit of advice: <b>Learn by playing not by reading.</b> If you have the opportunity to go try out a narrative game session run at a convention by someone who <i>knows the game and "gets" how it should get played</i>, you absolutely should. This would be especially true of BW: if you're near to the north east of the US, it's not out of the realm of possibility that you could attend a con where the lineage of the person hosting a BW event at a con is quite close to the source, so to speak. <br/><br/>I personally found HeroQuest impenetrable until I attended a con and saw how it was used in action, for four hours, by Greg Stafford. This was eye-opening: I immediately became enthused at how the game could work, turned around and dropped it on a group of newbies in my home town, and ran it for almost a year to great enjoyment by all.<br/><br/>A huge number of what people describe as "indie-games" seem to be quite "descriptive" in their approach to rules, rather than "prescriptive". This can make learning how to play them quite difficult, because strong familiarity with the text still might not be all that helpful when it comes to actual play of the game. Because of this, learning by playing, or even learning by watching others play, can be helpful. I recommend learning by playing, because personally I find "actual play" reports very hard to get through: in many cases, I have the same reaction to them I did when faced with the little fellow at the counter in the game store who regales anyone who will listen about the awesome play session he had on the weekend.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I would also suggest DnD4, but with this proviso: try to design your encounters with a higher proportion of skill challenges: instead of 2 or 3 challenges per 10 encounters, try tuning that up to 5 or 6. Skill challenges are, essentially, a narrative resolution mechanic nestled within the framework of a more-or-less traditional tactical conflict resolution game. My experiences with DnD4 to date have been surprisingly positive, and from the point of view of the referee I can also attest that building encounters with the game is, to me, much, much easier than with Burning Wheel (I found prepping games in BW quite difficult) -- your mileage may be similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169064/#Comment_169064" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T08:34:59+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  8:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2008 10:34AM by John Anderson.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I don't have extensive experience running BW, I have been in exactly the same situation. My first game running BW ended disastrously with exactly the issues that were mentioned in the OP. The system was 'too complicated' and there was a lot of OOC chatter from those players not directly 'in scene'. Some of those players were positively vehement in their opposition to the game however, some absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>That first debacle was purely down to me in that I leapt in with both feet using both DOW &amp; Fight! in that first session. Big mistake! And one that I rectified for further games by taking the advice given on the BW forums and repeated above. I only used the basic ruleset as outlined in the first 70odd pages and built on it as players became more accustomed to the steep learning curve. I also provided loads more information to the players on what the basic system involved. This was a printout of <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/images/4/46/Bw_04_25.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Spokes</a> from the BW wiki, which is the first 25 pages of the BW MRB.<br/><br/>Can I ask, are you the only owner of the rules, or does anyone else have a copy? I have found in subsequent games that more players went out and purchased the rules, and it has really made a huge difference in terms of what the players can contribute in terms of systemic knowledge. While my <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/BurningRaethEpisode1" rel="nofollow">current game</a> is still full of mistakes, it is faster and definitely coming together in terms of getting the system under out belts.<br/><br/>It also may sound funny, but recording the APs was done as a means for me to learn from the experience and has been a valuable learning tool.<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169073/#Comment_169073" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T09:11:40+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  9:11AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite><br/>Like<a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/images/9/9c/BWR-Fight-Checklist.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a>one?

Being one new person in a group that knows the rules isn't bad, and while it is intimidating, when you see how everyone else uses the rules it's easy to deal with DoW, Fight, and whatever else comes up (we never used Range and Cover, oddly enough). Having even two people who own the books can make a huge difference (as is probably the case for most systems). If some of your players are still interested, maybe consider putting the game on hold and letting some of the more interested players borrow your copy (or if you're feeling generous, buy a copy for them)? If you can have a couple of other people who know what's going on and can help guide those that don't, it will probably move much smoother.<br/><br/>And, to repeat the above: start simple. The basic rules for opposed tests and linked tests can get you a long ways into the game, then consider introducing Fight or DoW at a climactic moment, and start making it more common as needed. For example, my first session of Burning Wheel went something like this:<br/><br/>My Character gets introduced to the group (no dice rolls)<br/>We embark on a mission (some simple rolls to set things up in various ways)<br/>In executing the plan we put together, my character runs up against his beliefs (and actually breaks one, since I didn't quite get the idea at the time). (a few linked rolls, beliefs and artha come into play)<br/>Some thugs sent by the opposition attack (full on Fight)<br/>We eventually present our case for a treaty with a local leader (DoW, one of the more experienced players as the main presenter, everyone else aiding)<br/><br/>If you spread out a similar arc over a few sessions, I'd hope people would pick it up.<br/><br/>Another thing to focus on might be showing how the rules are 'better' even if they are complex. In a Fight, maybe script an enemy badly to show how the scripting mechanic creates a cool chaos in combat. If you're going to do a duel of wits, have it play out in an area where other systems might not be as well equiped, maybe a court room or somewhere else associated with formal arguments that a single roll doesn't really capture.<br/><br/>Finally, when in doubt, try to build a conflict that deals with the character's beliefs. I think the variety of roleplaying systems shows that if you put something interesting at stake, it doesn't really matter what mechanic you use to resolve it, people will be interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mycroft" title="Mycroft"><img alt="Mycroft" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mycroft">Mycroft</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169224/#Comment_169224" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T15:49:23+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  3:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as another  game in the narrative camp, you could consider a Spirit of the Century hack.

My first experience with Burning Wheel was in a group where: two people had read the game, one person was pretty actively not interested in learning new rules but would go along with what everyone else was interested in, and two of us were poor college students who didn't get a chance to buy the rules. I actually didn't buy the rules for myself until a few months ago, even though I knew I enjoyed the game a lot. The game was great, and I felt like I at least knew enough to make smart choices, if not the exact math behind how those choices worked out.<br/><br/>I'd guess that for most groups, there's some critical mass where if that many people know deeply/have read the rules, it will work for everyone. Problem is finding that value.<br/><br/>Again, I don't disagree with your point, if nobody is willing to learn the rules you're in trouble, but you also don't need every single person willing to run out and buy the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169310/#Comment_169310" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T22:15:05+00:00" title="September 15, 2008 10:15PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: sacredchao</cite>I don't think any of the others would be willing to read the books.</blockquote>\nI'd want people with more experience than myself to weight in, but I think this alone is going to prevent BW from being really successful with your group.<br/><br/>Like sage, I completely agree with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169313/#Comment_169313" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T22:28:42+00:00" title="September 15, 2008 10:28PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2008 10:29PM by noclue.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>Also for teaching Fight!

The group may need to be tolerant of a little GMly fumbling at the beginning, but what's really essential is a group of characters with BELIEFS that the players want to address in play and achievable goals to drive towards. That way you push your beliefs hard in play and the artha starts kicking in. Those DOWs are suddenly really important to the unfolding story of your character, and you feel the pain any time you have to make concessions.

Some of these games require honest-to-god <i>work.</i> On a related note to this is BW's insistence that players are involved with the creation of the story. Many gamers are used to going along with a nice story the GM has prepped for them, they just "plug in" at the table, socialize, and go home. BW doesn't let you do this. You have to have <i>drive, beliefs.</i> You have to want to <i>have an effect on the world.</i> Many players are uncomfortable to downright hostile to this idea. Perhaps a small discussion on a player's responsibility in a B* game is in order. Basically, BW expects players to take a much more active role in the creation of the story than they may be aware of.<br/><br/>Once they get used to it, though, boy is it awesome. The biggest thing I noticed as a change was <i>stuff happened.</i> Every session. Not just every 3 or 4 sessions when we hit a mini-arc the GM had planned. People did crazy shit every session and it was awesome. In order to do said crazy shit you have to understand how the rules let you (and <i>expect you</i>) affect the universe. I.E. you have to have read and understood the rules.  Also, you have to actively think of stuff you want to have happen, and then try to do them.<br/><br/>Many times when playing traditional games it felt like I was playing a computer RPG. I'll just wander around until my character activates a script that progresses the plot (or maybe starts a side-quest). Not so in BW. It's all about push push push, and it requires players to be able to actually think up proactive, instead of reactive actions. It means they have to do that which is normally the sole discretion of the GM, and some people are really uncomfortable with that (normally, it's people that have never GM'd themselves).<br/><br/>An honest conversation about what's expected at your table sounds like it's in order.<br/><br/>edit: fixed a open tag                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169458/#Comment_169458" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T11:51:22+00:00" title="September 16, 2008 11:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I wasn't gonna give the harsh advice, but it's late, so what the hell.<br/><br/>They're not invested?

I've seen it go both ways: you game with people who really aren't interested, simply because they're there, or you game with people you hate, because you want to game. Both of those lead to bad experiences and bad games. I've been lucky enough to barely encounter either, but they both suck.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if your friends are humoring you, they likely have some interest in what's going on. Maybe try exploring the spectrum of games a bit? Either go way rules light on Burning Wheel, or go for a combat-heavy (or combat-only) game, maybe D&amp;D 4E, or Descent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169459/#Comment_169459" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T11:52:22+00:00" title="September 16, 2008 11:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>Sacred, did you do Chargen together in your first session?

I think this honest conversation you speak of may very well be the answer to many of our problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169478/#Comment_169478" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T13:52:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2008  1:52PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I'd like to add that if people are not all-jacked up about the Situation, you have a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff" title="joshua neff"><img alt="joshua neff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.goblin-cartoons.com/images/lantern.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff">joshua neff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169576/#Comment_169576" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T04:20:22+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  4:20AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John's post is a bit harsh, but I agree with everything he said. Burning Wheel has quickly become one of my favorite games, but at least some of that may have to do with the people I play with. For one thing, we all have the books. (Well, I don't have the Magic Burner yet, but all three of us have the two core books and the Monster Burner.) For another thing, the GM, Jahmal, is familiar with the rules, but the other player, Jeremiah, is much more familiar and has played BW more than either of us. So while Jahmal takes the role of "story facilitator," Jeremiah is the rules guy, generally suggesting what would be a good way to use the mechanics. (Jahmal and I pretty much always agree with what Jeremiah suggests.) Also, all three of us are heavily invested in the game. Jahmal is more than happy to have us name NPCs or come up with bits of setting. ("I never came up with a name for your grandfather. If you have a good name for him, let's go with that.") Jeremiah and I egg each other on, to push our characters into complicated messes. All three of us collaborate, even when one PC isn't in a scene. When Beliefs and Instincts are being written up, we email them around so that everyone has input on them. All of that is what makes the game such a blast.<br/><br/>If your players aren't really into it, it doesn't matter what rules you're using.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169626/#Comment_169626" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T08:57:43+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  8:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2008 8:59AM by Thor_O.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ryan,<br/><br/>Sounds like everyone has already given you some good advice. We also have a number of good threads for helping new groups cataloged <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Fevered_Circle" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Just to reiterate the stuff that should help:\n<ol>\n<li>Set up an interested situation in which everyone is invested. Check out the Game Description <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tales_of_Ya-Gahn" rel="nofollow">here</a>. That's an example of what I mean. It's a compelling situation with no neat answer.</li>\n<li>Go back over Beliefs. Everyone should have a Belief tied into the situation at hand. They can all be different, but they should all focus on the situation.</li>\n<li>Take the advice in the book and start with only the first 77 pages of the book. Focus on Standard tests, Versus tests, Linked tests, Advancement and Artha.</li>\n<li>Pay special attention to Intent and and Task. Fight!, Duel of Wits, Range and Cover, et al, are superficial to Burning Wheel. They are fun but not essential. Intent and Task (together with Beliefs, Artha and Advancement) is the beating heart of Burning Wheel. Remember that all tests--that is, anytime you use the dice--have consequences in Burning Wheel. Consequence is tied to Intent. If you succeed, you get your Intent. If you fail, your Intent is complicated or twisted in some fashion (which can mean failure, but not necessarily). Whenever anyone goes for the dice, make sure to ask yourself: Do I have an interesting consequence if this Intent is failed? If not, just Say Yes.</li>\n<li>As GM, it's your job to regulate the scale of the Intents the players put forward. It's ok and even beneficial to suggest that an Intent might be too big for one roll, and to break it up into a series of discrete Tasks. More tasks means more potential consequences means more potential interesting twists and turns in the story.</li>\n<li>Encourage the players to take risks in pursuit of their Beliefs. Risk is the flip side of Intent. Whenever you make a test, you risk having to pay the consequence. That should be embraced! Consequences are interesting! As the GM, it is your job to make sure consequences are always interesting, but not always so punishing that players fear to take risks.</li>\n<li>Begin introducing the systems from the Rim once the players gain facility with Intent and Task, tests, Artha and Advancement. Resources, Circles, and Duel of Wits are all good candidates to introduce first. Remember that Intent and Task remain fundamental concepts. They don't get superseded because you've added a subsystem. In fact, an action in Fight! or Duel of Wits is simply a more regulated version of a Standard or Versus test in which we specify the scale of your Intent for you. If you choose a Strike action in Fight!, your Intent is to hurt your opponent and your task is the Sword skill (or whichever weapon you're using).</li>\n<li>Encourage your players to take some responsibility for the rules themselves. That doesn't mean they have to read the books (although it would be nice). But if someone states the Intent of making a tapestry as a gift for the baron using his Weaver skill as the task, while the GM and the player are talking, someone else should pick up the Character Burner and look up the Weaver skill to give the sample Obstacles to the GM. This sort of thing goes a long, long way.</li>\n</ol>\nHope this helps!<br/>Thor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169655/#Comment_169655" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T11:05:49+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 11:05AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does, actually.
