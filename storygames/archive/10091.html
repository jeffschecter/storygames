Chris Perkins' Wednesday night game is a world of small islands and large oceans, and our low-paragon group has just acquired our first ship. We routinely have sessions in which we don't roll a single die, and one such session a few weeks back involved us attempting to hire a crew. Chris informed us, through an NPC ally, that the secret to a happy crew was a good ship's cook. When all was said and done, we managed to successfully hire the best cook in the city through a series of roleplaying encounters, wrangling him away from the service of another captain. As negotiations wrapped up, I happily leaned back in my chair and announced my satisfaction at finally hiring my own personal chef -- even if he was only around to make me midnight snacks in game. What a night!</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Fourth edition doesn't include some of the mundane mechanical elements of character building that 3rd Edition did. For example, certain skills (I'm looking at you Craft and Profession) enabled a player to feel like his character had some sort of grounding in the "real world" of the campaign. Odds were good that you never made a Craft or Profession check in your game, but having ranks in that skill made you feel connected to your character's background. In 4th Edition, those skills are gone. Why? Because we feel like a character's statistics don't represent the absolute truth of a character's story. That's right -- one of the reasons those skills (and other such elements from other editions) are gone is that we felt they hindered roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you want to say your character was a blacksmith's apprentice and knows how to make his own sword, just say so. Don't worry about feeling forced to reflect that story decision mechanically. Just write it on your character sheet. Liberating, isn't it?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">...in every RPG I've played over the past twenty years and more, roleplaying was ultimately a result of the narrative brought to the table by the DM and players, not something provided by rules. That's the beauty of roleplaying, after all!

I get what people are saying about 4E nerfing their skills and spoiling their fun. 4E is a completionist design and by leaving out a bunch of stuff about riding horses, making armor, and cooking, the rules are basically saying that PCs can't do that. Maybe you don't interpret it that way, but when a set of rules that has hundreds of pages of detailed powers leaves something out, it's doing so on purpose, and it's okay to believe the game is saying, "don't do anything not here." <br><br>When I run 4E, it isn't like that, of course. I recognize that I am drifting the rules though. There's no reason that players shouldn't be able to write down that their characters were blacksmiths and have them be able to make swords and stuff. The player might be cheated out of a skill check though, and that can ruin the fun.<br><br>Still, I think it's wrong to say that 4E gets in the way of role-playing. Not having certain skills on the list doesn't stop you from role-playing around all the stuff the game does spotlight. Role-play about your cool combat powers. Role-play about your race and class and alignment. Role-play about the skills you have and the feats. Role-play about the situation the DM put you in, with all of its points-of-lights goodness. The rules do help you with that, with all the game structures I mentioned. There are sections of the rules that are not mechanical. Treat them as guides for role-playing. <br><br>There aren't procedural rules that help you role-play though other than "describe what you're doing when you use a character ability." Look at other games and you'll see procedures that get into the character deeper. I don't know that you'll find any of those rules in earlier versions of D&amp;D though, so I don't entirely understand where these 3.5E fans are coming from, except for the skill-nerfing thing. Is removing a couple skills enough to really kill "role-playing" for a gamer? Geez, if so, house-rule them back in already. But as Jason and others have pointed out, now you're burning skill slots on blacksmithing stuff that is less likely to be useful during the game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223939/#Comment_223939" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T08:50:23+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  8:50AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Bent</cite>That second paragraph reads as utter bullshit to me.</blockquote>\nThe second paragraph is what other folks call "The Fruitful Void".

It failed to revive a brand in its twilight year. Traffic to wizards.com fell following 4E's launch, rather than rising, and has never recovered. Followup sales remain scarce, with overall sales no better now than the last year of 3.5. Wizards has sold "hundreds of thousands" of 4E books total as of March 2009, against a claimed playerbase of 6 million. That's terrible for a division of Hasbro, and since WotC answers to that corporate overlord, it gets people fired.<br/><br/>Links:<br/><a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=49159" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=49159</a><br/><a href="http://tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=49988" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=49988</a><br/><a href="http://www.chrispramas.com/2008/12/rpg-musings.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.chrispramas.com/2008/12/rpg-musings.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223960/#Comment_223960" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T09:33:01+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  9:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Er...

Though as far as the Lightning Rail goes, it's not for everybody.  Also consider the railways of the American old west.  They still cut through dangerous territory filled with bandits and angry natives, and while likely safer, weren't a guarantee of safety.  Heck, a cyberpunk, urban-sprawl metroplex could be "points of light" if the areas of safety and authority are few and far between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223967/#Comment_223967" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T09:46:07+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  9:46AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Essentially I agree with Adam. People here know how to get to Imagination Land no matter which kind of RPG car we're driving to get there.  D&amp;D 4e is probably going to be a number of peoples' introduction to roleplaying games in general, and these new players are going to look to the rules for guidance on how roleplaying games work and how they should be played. What the skills, and some of the non-combat class abilities and feats did in 3e did, was give the players a structured way of saying "here is a another facet of your character". They helped add complexity to the characters beyond what they could do in combat and suggested that non-combat encounters were to be expected and dealt with with rules as well. My fighter has craft (blacksmithing) or profession (sailor). Why? I will grant that it's not much, but it's better than nothing. It's a rickety little bridge pointing players towards the Fruitful Void. I was hoping 4e was going to take these tiny concessions to roleplaying and expand upon them, but it took even these away for the most part.<br/><br/>I think I mentioned this before, but when my group of older, D&amp;D 3e players started playing D&amp;D 4e, they assumed their characters were incapable of becoming blacksmiths because it wasn't in the rules. Even knowing them, I was pretty stunned at their naivety, but that's some proof right there.<br/><br/>I called bullshit on the assertion that stripping away the crafting, profession, some of the knowledge and other misc. skills because I don't believe that they were something they were joyously sacrificing on the alter of the Fruitful Void. I think they were another thing hacked out indiscriminately in the name of streamlining. They're essentially claiming that it's not a bug, it's a feature. I could be wrong. Maybe there's something in the DMG that details how to handle all of this stuff. <br/><br/><small>I need to quit with the 4e bashing, I know.

The dungeon was the place for combat and problem-solving and trap-deactivating - in other words, engagement with the rules.  <br/><br/>In between dungeons, it was back to the city to rest and recharge.  There was some obligatory rules engagement (healing, leveling, etc.)...but this "down time" between dungeons was when roleplaying happened. This was when you got to talk to the barkeep or the shadowy stranger, or face the stern temple priest, or go on shopping sprees, or whatever.  After about half of a session of this it was back to the wilderness (with its nightly threats of wandering monsters, tracking rolls, ambushes on the trail, etc.) en route to the next dungeon.<br/><br/>The tradition was established that the rules governed action, and the roleplaying took place entirely removed from the rules.  You see this tradition rear its head in most discussions of social conflict on RPG.net ("keep your filthy hands off my roleplaying, you damned dirty rules").  I don't find it at all strange or incongruent that someone extolling 4E would invoke The Fruitful Void, because in D&amp;D it has always been there in a very regimented fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223972/#Comment_223972" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T09:52:47+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  9:52AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>It's not that they don't know they can imagine their characters as blacksmiths. It's that they want making their characters blacksmiths to have mechanical weight. System Does Matter. They want the game to be about adventuring blacksmiths (sorta, you know). They don't like that the game says that blacksmithing doesn't matter. Essentially, 4E says that you'll never make a skill check in a conflict that depends on you being a blacksmith. This kills the fun for some people.<br/><br/>A reasonable response to that might be, "Why the hell would you want to be a blacksmith? You're a skeleton-smashing Avenger!" Sure. D&amp;D 3.5E wasn't that way though. Your PC might conceivably save the day because he is an expert blacksmith, because your DM read the flags on your character sheet and dropped a Craft skill check encounter in your path. "Zero to Hero" is an important aspect of older versions of D&amp;D and 4E got rid of the "Zero" in more ways than one (increased survivability, lack of daily-life skills, scarier powers at 1st level, Points of Light implying that PCs are very special, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223978/#Comment_223978" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T10:12:44+00:00" title="August 11, 2009 10:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            System does indeed matter, and it's damned near essential for some of the people I play D&amp;D with. I think they do want that mechanical weight, and some sort of way to track how awesome they are at a given skill, even if it's something as non-essential as leatherworking. They also want limits. So they can be leatherworkers? Can they be master leatherworkers at level 1? If not, why not? If they <i>can</i> be master leatherworkers, they should be able to sell their pieces for a lot of gold. They need downtime for it? Okay, the party spends two months letting the leatherworker make some masterwork S&amp;M gear for the local duke and make bank.<br/><br/>Here then, the freedom of roleplaying starts intruding on something the designers DID care about, namely player wealth and buying power. This may sound like a somewhat outlandish scenario, but when your players are fairly encouraged by the rules to optimise, optimise, optimise, they are going to approach the roleplaying aspect in a similar light, and why should they be expected to do otherwise?<br/><br/>And I think encouraging people to be blacksmiths or have knolwedge (nobility) are great things, especially for people who aren't fancy free when it comes to unleashing their creativity. As I say, it's a start. It's a way of making D&amp;D becoming less of a board game, which it is always in danger of becoming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223980/#Comment_223980" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T10:22:12+00:00" title="August 11, 2009 10:22AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that it's nice to have what somebody called "traction" in RPGs.

It also sounds like a communication problem or possibly an identity crisis. <br/><br/>I think for many DMs there is a yearning to make D&amp;D something it's not. I've walked into countless D&amp;D 3 games where the DM told me, this is going to be a political game about nobles. And I was like... really? And they told me to make a social, diplomacy, bluff based character only to sit there with nothing to do for 2 hours while we played out a huge combat that had nothing to do with nobles. Hell, I've even told that story to people before agreeing to play in their games... you know the last game was supposed to be about political intrigue but it didn't turn out that way... no, no... this time it's different! It's weird. Maybe it's just easier to get players to play D&amp;D, and you want it to be something else, but still play it basically as is, and you just end up fighting against yourself. <br/><br/>None of this having to do with roleplaying. You can roleplay regardless of the above.<br/><br/>I think Adam is right in that when people say 4E doesn't have roleplaying they mean it's mainly a combat game. Which isn't the same thing. <br/><br/>The linked article only confuses the issue. Instead of emphasizing how you can roleplay just as much in combat as outside of combat, they focus on how they play games where they don't use any of the rules at all. And that their roleplaying is enhanced because the rules aren't restricting them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224008/#Comment_224008" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T11:29:46+00:00" title="August 11, 2009 11:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I don\u2019t understand how rules in general hinder roleplaying.<br/><br/>Unless by roleplaying we mean something very specific.</blockquote>\nYes, I think that people who say that 4E hinders their role-playing mean that they don't get any System (say, skill checks) for doing specific things they want their characters to do (say, making swords). Role-playing isn't free-form make-believe. They can free-form make-believe their sword making, but they can't role-play it.<br/><br/>Flip things around. Say I write D&amp;D 5E and take all the rules for combat out of it. It's nothing but a skill system, but none of the skills address combat. You can still pretend you're fighting, but can you role-play an Avenger or a Paladin or a Rogue in combat the same way you could in 4E? Does that system hinder your role-playing combat in any way? I say it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224010/#Comment_224010" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T11:33:26+00:00" title="August 11, 2009 11:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The linked article only confuses the issue.

When it comes to D&amp;D 4E, the designers finally decided to give the game a focus.  In 4E, your characters are adventurers, and when you're adventuring, you have no need of profession rolls or craft skills.  If you're taking weeks off at a time in order work on your farm, and need some mechanical validation for that, why play D&amp;D?  The game is Dungeons and Dragons, after all, not Markets and Merchants.  4E doesn't cater to that because the designers decided that making profession rolls doesn't actually help tell the stories that 4E is designed to tell.  And because those mechanical systems don't exist in 4E, you're free to have more narrative freedom when dealing with those aspects of the character's lives.<br/><br/>Now, a lot of people seem to be frustrated by this, but methinks that those are the ones who don't necessarily realize that System Does Matter (I'm generalizing here, and I apologize).  That is, they've been trying to use D&amp;D to tell stories that it was never designed to tell.  If you want to play political intrigue, why use a system that has a primary stat called Base Attack Bonus?  Use something like In a Wicked Age, or WoD, or whatever else.  If, on the other hand, you want to tell stories about adventurers killing monsters and taking their stuff, D&amp;D is the perfect fit, and 4E more so than 3.5.<br/><br/>Of course, many D&amp;D players have never actually tried any other system.  Some aren't even aware that there ARE any other systems beyond D&amp;D.  Methinks THAT's something that needs to be fixed. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224016/#Comment_224016" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T11:46:05+00:00" title="August 11, 2009 11:46AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2009 11:46AM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, given that WotC was throwing such a big hissy fit about their IP that they burned down the OGL for 4E and actually stopped all PDF sales, does anyone else find it funny that the linked Dragon editorial article includes a link to a youtube clip of "Bambi"?

Even if he doesn't have it screened - which I would find somewhat surprising, given usual corporate policy about flagship and high-profile communications channels - then he is definitely going to be held responsible if the higher-ups don't like what he posted. Remember, there are lots of cases of people being fired over content posted on their personal blogs. Thinking that something posted in a high-profile position on an official company website isn't subject to either proactive screening or reactive retribution just does not sync with how businesses normally function.<br/>Of course it was screened, <i>and</i> of course he believes it. The people who liked it better the 3.5 way all went to work for someone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Rules hinder roleplaying? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10091/rules-hinder-roleplaying/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Rules hinder roleplaying? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10091/rules-hinder-roleplaying/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: misuba Of course it was screened,andof course he believes it.

One of them delivers a convincing performance, his voice filled with candour and integrity, his speech clear and emotionally captivating. The other actor is more subdued, he quietly opens a draw, nods his approval, and listens. Which one is acting? The reason I ask this question is that I see lots of posts where combat and the skills involved in combat are somehow distinct from other activities and their skills, in that only the latter is true roleplaying. It's as though we only roleplay when our characters are blacksmithing or basket weaving, but not when we decide that they will fearlessly charge the ettin regardless of our characters low hit points. I see roleplaying as a way of revealing our characters. Whether that is done by deciding to roll an attack or look for a cook doesn't matter, so long as what we reveal remains believable and reasonably consistent. Rules may narrow down our pool of available choices, but they do not stop us from making choices for our characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224067/#Comment_224067" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T13:48:33+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  1:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think all of us here agree that one definition of role-playing is "anything we do at the table, if it has to do with the game." Right?

If I'm playing D&amp;D the rules do help me roleplay the kind of character that D&amp;D is set up for. They both illuminate what makes my character an adventurer and what the other players might expect from my character as adventurer. This isn't hindering. It's liberating. My character is an adventurer because he explorers dangerous places and kills monsters, he's a wizard because he uses magic to do this, he's good because he will only fight evil monsters and only when there's a good cause, and so on. The roleplay doesn't end when the rules begin or the dice start rolling, it just continues by another means. Moreover, isn't it implicit in the rules that that D&amp;D is a game of heroic fantasy. Every option in the D&amp;D books points (or should point) to this. D&amp;D isn't a game of heroic fantasy because of the way we narrate our games. It's heroic fantasy because its built into the very rules that foster that particular kind of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224082/#Comment_224082" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T14:40:18+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  2:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2009 4:22PM by Brand_Robins.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Redacted because I was being a dick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224098/#Comment_224098" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T15:48:34+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  3:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2009 3:50PM by ccreitz.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Warlocks, one of the coolest classes, hints at these pacts you make [...]</blockquote>That's <i>exactly</i> what attracted me to warlocks when I first read the rules!And then you realize you just wanted to play Sorcerer, or Mage: The Ascension (duck). But seriously, Mage.<br/><br/>When I survey 4e, more than anything else, I am infuriated by its refusal to engage with the fiction, here with Warlocks and their pacts and elsewhere as well. I can see a great game in there, trying very hard to escape from under a pile of WoW-crap, but I have no special interest in digging.  I wish there were some more rules, rules to help roleplaying. Why isn't the Entity with whom I have entered into a pact an important NPC? Why does my ally get healed when I lay my holy smack on that goblin? If we don't say (something like "My dark gods empower my strike with vampiric might - be healed by the blood of this creature!" is fine if florid), then we fall into the trap that Baker identified of shortcutting the fiction, getting lazy about all the stuff between Intent and Effect, and I'm with him: you don't get good stories out of speedreading.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I think I know why the whole smack-goblin-heal-ally-without-saying-why thing doesn't bother most 4e players.

(Full disclosure: I'm in Adam's D&amp;D game, like it, and have never played WoW)<br/><br/>This particular Cleric power comes in for a lot of hate.  But, the game itself gives you an explanation - there's a little bit of color text up at the top of the power that says something about how seeing your mighty smite fills your ally with divine power (my PHB is upstairs near my sleeping daughter, I haven't trained Stealth, and this damn game won't let me train Child Rearing - it's not even on the list!)  Now, you may think the color text *sucks,* and I might agree - I'm not a fan of the default color for Clerics and Paladins, for the most part, and prefer to make up something "grittier" when I play them. But that's different than saying the game just doesn't bother to connect the mechanics with fiction.  <br/><br/>But the general complaint confuses me, too.  Most of the discussion in this thread has been about how the lack of mechanical expressions for some things hinders fun.  This is different - it's about how having trouble making fictional sense of a mechanic hinders fun.<br/><br/>I don't see how this is any different from, say, figuring out why having sex with someone in Bliss Stage gives me a giant, throbbing robot gun (oh... wait...) or what it means that I succeeded in all my conflicts during a Burning Empires maneuver but failed the Maneuver roll.  In games like that, most people take "odd" mechanical results to be spurs to creativity in the fiction.  When I've actually played D&amp;D 4E, we've never gotten seriously bogged down trying to figure out how the Bard can Viciously Mock a lizard ("Dangle some food in front of it, then pull it away!") or anything like that. When I'm stuck for fiction, I welcome a suggestive mechanical bit (Hmm.  Why does my deity heal my allies every time I hit someone with a stick?).<br/><br/>Is it maybe that D&amp;D is in a sort of mechanical "uncanny valley?"  I bet if I showed many people a game that had a totally abstract power system, and one player came up with, "See, I worship Agg, deity of hitting people.  So every time I hit someone, Agg is pleased with me and heals an ally by the margin of success," they wouldn't bat an eye at it.  Does 4E suffer by giving you enough specificity in the fiction to work with if you want to do what it wants to do, but not enough sense that you can re-skin it if you don't like the fiction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224148/#Comment_224148" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T20:32:40+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  8:32PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys thanks for reminding me for all the high flouting duck speech, that this is still the internet. <br/><br/>Warmed the hocks of my twisted little heart it did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224163/#Comment_224163" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T21:18:16+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  9:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2009 9:19PM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basket weaving was mentioned, and I'd like to point out how terrible a system 4E is at doing my combat-specialized basket weaver compared to 3.5.

Is your concern just that the game doesn't explicitly tell you to narrate?  Most games don't, but that doesn't stop you from doing it.  Or, is it that you feel that the game somehow discourages you from doing so?  If so, my experience is that is far from unique to 4E, or to D&amp;D.  I've only played Dogs once, but there was at least one moment where someone said, "OK, I escalate to violence then," and the GM had to prod him to say *how.*  And I've played plenty of sessions of Burning Empires where things like, "OK, I FoRK regulations-wise..." passed in the heat of trying to find dice.  Heck, I even had to remind someone playing Misspent Youth once that you shouldn't just say, "OK, I'll sell out Tough to Brutal" without narrating.<br/><br/>People only have so much head space - so, especially when rules get complex, they may focus on the mechanics and drop the role-playing.  In my experience, that's been the biggest comparative disadvantage of 4E - in some games, people seem to be allergic to calculating bonuses, learning powers in advance, etc. and then the mechanics suck a lot of life and time at the table (but no more than, "wait... what can I use Fate Artha for again?").  Ironically, that gives me a rep as a rules-monger who's memorized the book, just because I want to be able to focus on describing the blast of nuclear fire that accompanies the arrival of my Invoker's Angel of Fire, rather than calculating its AC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224414/#Comment_224414" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T23:51:06+00:00" title="August 12, 2009 11:51PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2009 11:53PM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite></blockquote>It's now my turn to be shocked to be agreeing with Graham (though, I suspect I wouldn't had this thread been what either of us were expecting it to be).<br/>The OP links to a 4E apologetic, and you expect something besides an edition discussion?

They added loads of skills designed to give the character 'depth' (languages, professions and so on), but since they cost points, if you wanted to have someone who was good at something just for the pure interest/character design value of it, then you had to give up some of the points you would otherwise have used for cool powers. You had abilities you'd hardly use, unless your GM was kind to you, but still had to buy them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224714/#Comment_224714" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T11:20:30+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 11:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Dude, remember that time we played D&amp;D and we didn't even roll dice?

One said "dude, that session rocked" and the other one was like "dude, those were 3 lost hours doing some lame talking".<br/><br/>So, yeah. I think the thing in here is not even about "roleplaying", but about fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10091/rules-hinder-roleplaying" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10091/rules-hinder-roleplaying" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10091/rules-hinder-roleplaying/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10091%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10091%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
