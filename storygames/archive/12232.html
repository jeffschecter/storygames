Don't have Photoshop, so I've been wrestling with Gimp! Think I've got the hang of it now... The Dwarven words I'm using are from <a href="http://www.guildsite.com/dawi/language.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the calendar is from <a href="http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010:Calendar" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>Names I got from <a href="http://www.bugmansbrewery.com/tutorials/article/24-dwarf-names/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.]<br/><br/>From the journals of Okri Grong, 14th Granite, 748CY<br/>They call this spring? Loki's beard, this is more savage than any winter I can recall back in the Mountainhomes. The bitter sleet clings to our clothing, and fouls up the mineworks like a bad case of krut. I can only hope the Karazrik knew what he was doing, sending us out here scouting for nothing more than a legend. Camping in makeshift tunnels like goblins, we are, and still not a sniff of the Grindal Lode. Half the ale has gone bad with some sort of fibrous mould. Mundri has done another casting - he says this is definitely the place, and that the the runes never lie; I wonder though, can they bend the truth?<br/><br/>19th Slate, 748CY<br/>Thorek is recovering from several lungfuls of water and miscellaneous sprains, but the healers say he should be back on his feet soon. The poor wazzok must've fallen twenty feet, straight down, by the looks of it. I think the water we've hit must be the Withering Rill; fast-flowing, strewn with dangerous rocks and deathly cold. They say our ancestors tried to navigate the Rill some years ago, but their boat was dashed to pieces in the harsh currents, like a leaf in a skreefall. It's going to be difficult to get around without a major detour - the rocks either side of the rift are fractured and unstable. Tunnelling across and around from further up the shaft could cost us days. Mundri's last cast said we dig straight down, but I think this place is getting to him a little - these past few days he seems to do little more than mutter to himself and scribble away feverishly at his workbench. I'd blame that bad ale, but I haven't seen him touch any for days. I asked him what he was sketching, but he ignored me, muttering about wood and goat-hide...<br/><br/>20th Slate, 748CY<br/>Mundri seems to have finished sketching and has been splashing about furiously down in the Rill for hours. We tried to stop him at first, when he started climbing down with arms full of wood, but there was a fire in his eye that made us think twice. He won't talk to us or accept any aid, but he seems to be building something - from the plans he left on his bench, it looks like some kind of machine. I wonder if it'll help us bypass the river? I worry that we might not have enough wood and goat hide for him to finish whatever it is he's doing. I hope it's worthwhile; he's using up a lot of resources on this project of his. If it goes on much longer, I think we'll have to stop him by force.<br/><br/>22nd Slate, 748CY<br/>Mundri is recovering in his bunk - unsurprisingly he's suffering from cold and exhaustion, other than that it's just bruises. His ingenious machine is pumping away all on its own. The contraption has somehow completely drained a section of riverbed, big enough for us to carry on digging right through the base of the Rill. It seems to need no power other than that of the water itself.<br/>Mundri claims not to remember the last few days at all, either scribbling the plans or building the thing. He says it must've been divine inspiration. For now, I'm not going to look a gift mushroom in<br/>the gills - we need to get digging again. Yorri has found some lichens he reckons will brew nicely into wine - that should help with the ale shortage, but next time we see a caravan I'll be sure to put in a request for some decent beer.<br/><br/>28th Felsite, 748CY<br/>We're all tired of skratting around in slotch like a pack of rats. There's still not so much as a hint of gold down here. Yorri's lichen wine is fermenting nicely, but it's no substitute for a good foaming<br/>flagon of Gundrik's Obsidian Stout. I miss the Mountainhomes. I feel as if the very stones are our opponents here, and I feel that they are winning.<br/><br/>29th Felsite, 748CY<br/>A terrible day, and a glorious day. Thorek went missing, so we organised a search. When we found him, he was blind and couldn't speak. When he found his voice at last, all he could say was<br/>"beautiful... so beautiful..."<br/>We retraced his steps to where he was mining. There, next to his discarded pick, was a deep hole... and within, the fire of gold. So much gold! This has to be the Grindal lode! The tragedy of Thorek's blindness cannot douse the fever that burns within me. The Karazrik, Mundri and his runes - they were right, all of them. Even the farmers and fishers are taking up picks to join in the digging.<br/>We must set up a proper barracks down here. We're as rich as kings, now; would a king hang from a cavern wall in a hammock, like a bat?<br/>We'll dig ourselves a fortress, carve out a city.

We continue to dig through<br/>\ngold-rich rock - the ore shows no sign of exhaustion. Truly the<br/>\nGrindal Lode is a wondrous find. Also, we have been studying the<br/>\npumping mechanism built by Mundri - most interesting, but difficult to<br/>\nstudy properly without dismantling it - of course, we dare not for<br/>\nfear of drowning! In time, I think we will unlock its secrets.<br/>\n<br/>\n13th Slate, 750CY / 2DD<br/>\nToday we were digging a chamber to house some of the ore, when we<br/>\nstruck water. A trickle at first, then a stream and before long a jet.<br/>\nThe pressure is immense, and the water is mineral-rich - this can only<br/>\nbe the lost Sea of Tears! The half-dug chamber is flooding fast, and<br/>\ndespite our efforts it is spilling out, into the main shaft and down<br/>\ninto the mineworks. I must return to work; we cannot let this flood go<br/>\nunchecked, or we will all drown under the weight of an entire sea.<br/>\n<br/>\n29th Slate, 750CY / 2DD<br/>\nWe finally have the water under control, thanks to a good solid dam<br/>\nand some mechanisms we reverse-engineered from Mundri's pumps.<br/>\nAlthough the lower mineworks are now flooded, it has been an<br/>\nunexpected boon - we have built barges, which make transporting the<br/>\nore back to the main shaft much easier. There seems to be an outlet<br/>\nsomewhere, which prevents the mine from flooding completely. Also, the<br/>\nwaterfall seems to please many dwarves - indeed, the misty spray is<br/>\nquite charming - so we have let it continue to fall down the main<br/>\nshaft. We have mechanisms in place to control the flow from above,<br/>\nsuch that the caverns below do not overflow, nor do they run dry.<br/>\n<br/>\n7th Timber, 751 CY / 3DD<br/>\nThe noise of dwarves working within the barracks has become<br/>\nintolerable, so we have dug a complex of separate workshops down near<br/>\nthe mine works. Most dwarves are happy with this new arrangement,<br/>\nexcept for the lazy ones of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markpank" title="markpank"><img alt="markpank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://markpank.0sites.net/img/tn.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markpank">markpank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274471/#Comment_274471" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T08:18:19+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  8:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And, now that I've secured some web space, the files:<br/><br/><a href="http://markpank.0sites.net/HtHaD/Drung-Duraz_3.png" rel="nofollow">Drung-Duraz, Year 3 PNG</a><br/><a href="http://markpank.0sites.net/HtHaD/Drung-Duraz_3.psd" rel="nofollow">Drung-Duraz, Year 3 PSD</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://markpank.0sites.net/HtHaD/Drung-Duraz_3_thumb.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274572/#Comment_274572" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:28:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:28PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2011 7:00AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am Galaz, daughter of Thorek and Stromez.  Today, I am fourteen and add my name to the Scroll of Life.  <br/><br/>I was born in the first year of Drung-Duraz after the families began to join the mountainsteaders.  In that age, the ground around Drung-Duraz was stable and rich; supporting our people well with gold and hearty mushrooms.  My earliest memory is of playing on the steps of the Hall of Duraz, our city's grandest treasure while my mother laid stones in the monument.  <br/><br/>It was the water, most say, that destroyed our homeland.  It percolated through the rock from a vast sea and endangered our mines and homes.  My people rerouted the mines to keep tunnels above water, but they say that it would eventually fill our home and hide the source of our life -- the Grindal Lode, located by my very father.  Another of the leading men -- Mundri, devised a method to dispose of the water so that we could continue to mine.  He lead the digging of a dry well; a great pit to swallow the water; a sump.  It was ill-fated.<br/><br/>A few of the diggers report that Mundri broke into a vast cavern but others deny it.  Whether or not this is true, the ground began to shake.  Our tunnels were strong -- works of masterdwarfship and those then there believed we could wait the tremmor out in safety.  Of course, that too was ill-fated.  The tremmors continued and grew worse.  Many dwarfs were killed but others took what they could, climbed to the surface and returned here to the Mountainhome.  <br/><br/>Occasionally, an expedition sets out -- chasing the memory of that rich gold.  Occassionally, they return.  Each time, they report the continued shaking of the earth.  Until this last, returned only five weeks ago.  The ground, they say, has at last settled.  The tunnels are in ruins.  And there are fell creatures prowling in the dark.<br/><br/>Today, I am fourteen and add my name to the Scroll of Life.  I am Galaz: tunnel hunter and axedwarf.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://weeksfamily.net/images/pre-Monsters.png"/><br/><br/><a href="http://weeksfamily.net/images/pre-Monsters.png" rel="nofollow">The PNG</a><br/><a href="http://weeksfamily.net/images/pre-Monsters.psd" rel="nofollow">The PSD</a><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>So, the population of dwarfs confused me -- when it was four, they should have built a great hall, right?  But I just incremented up the construction table.  In the fifth year, they wanted to dig an exploratory shaft and I had this flooding problem going on, so I made it that -- and they went off map and triggered the Great Disaster.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure how to really use layers.  Rich, you're inheriting the map from me.  Please feel free to use the "Before the Age of Monsters" layer or build something more suitable.  I left the earthquake as a layer and also other stuff.

Maybe the Dwarves were too busy dealing with the flooding to have any time for a great hall... or maybe I'm just an idiot who forgot to build anything that year. <img alt=":s" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confounded.png" title=":s"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274824/#Comment_274824" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T06:17:30+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  6:17AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to need a day or two to get to this I'm afraid.

The knights of Karival make a brave showing in battle against the orcs, driving them into the caverns of the earth. The fleeing orcish clan stumbles into the ancient lair of the Dreaming Wyrm, waking her from her thousand-year slumber... in the desperate battle that follows, the orcish chieftain manages to slay the wyrm and take her crown. From this day forth, the Darksong clan will be known as the Wyrmslayers... <br/><br/>Sea-drow, exiled from the elven sea-city of Talantius, find themselves in the depths beneath the Sea of Tears. They discover the untold riches of the Grindal Lode, and set their murloc slaves to mining and smelting the newfound gold.<br/><br/>Loktarg, the Ogre Magi, is born in the caverns above the Sea of Tears. He springs forth fully grown from his hag mother's womb, slaying her and her craven servants within hours of his birth. In battle, he faces the Wyrmslayer clan, demanding tribute. Weary from their struggles against the Dreaming Wyrm, they accede.<br/><br/><b>The Year Three Hundred and Thirty of the Kingdom of Alamar, or, 1372CY in the Old Dwarven Time</b><br/><br/>A new settler family, the Meinrichs, moves into the Grindal Valley. Their young son, Karl, joins the knights of Karival, bringing his family's sword and shield. Unbeknown to him or his family, the Meinrich shield was crafted in Drung-Duraz in ages past, blessed by their smiths with the power of the forge god, and given to his ancestors in thanks for services rendered. Karl quickly rises in status, become the personal squire of the Baron himself.<br/><br/>The sea-drow, in their deep watery caverns, continue to plunder the wealth of the earth.

Stout of heart they were, being no less than Dwarves, hoping to reclaim their ancestral lands.  They settled in to ye olde pub and waited for the snow to melt.<br/><br/>The primordial beasts wandered in circles, but did not wander far.<br/><br/>The mighty castle attracted more young men of a violent persuasion, and the Hueber family moved into the valley to raise goats.  Their young daughter Hedwig is haunted by dreams of a mighty wyrm.<br/><br/>The isolated Sea-Drow continued to mine and mine away.  Shall a Villain arise among them?  Perhaps.<br/><br/>The orcs continued to breed, but they starved at the same rate.  Their situation growing dire, they finally revolted against the tyranny of the Ogre Magi!  Successfully!  They looted back all their old loot.<br/><br/>The Ogre Magi, defeated, fell into the dark waters of the sea.  He sank into the deep currents for some period of time.  Eventually, he was churned out through the ancient pump and deposited in the dwarven ruins.  There he sought out a precious treasure from the very depths of the earth.<br/><br/>The dwarven adventurers finally decided it was time to go kick some orc ass, and descended into the dungeon.  They were surrounded by orcs and slaughtered.  The orcs were delighted to have yet more loot -- they dug out a special treasure vault just to store it all.  Shall a Villain arise among them?  It may be so.<br/><br/><br/><i>That comes close to wrapping up the Age of Monsters; I expect next year that either the sea-drow or the orcs will become sufficiently wealthy to be villainous.  I yield the floor to the next player.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markpank" title="markpank"><img alt="markpank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://markpank.0sites.net/img/tn.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markpank">markpank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277789/#Comment_277789" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T03:20:23+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  3:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A cliffhanger...
