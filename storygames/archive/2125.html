                    I've been thinking about this mechanic for a while. Could you tweak it, suggest changes, add bits to it and so on?<br/><br/>So it's a GM-less game called <i>Heist</i>. There are crime-themed challenges, each with a difficulty number. For example: Security Keypad, Difficulty Level 3.<br/><br/>And there's a deck of cards. They're custom cards, consisting of:
<ul>
<li>No stars</li>
<li>One star</li>
<li>Two star</li>
<li>Three stars</li>
<li>One bomb</li>
<li>Two bombs</li>
<li>Three bombs</li>
</ul>
...and there are slightly more star cards than bomb cards. Every player gets dealt a hand of cards.<br/><br/>So, let's say someone wants to disable the security camera. He narrates how he wants to do it: "I wait for the guard to continue his patrol. The moment he leaves, I slip in, standing beneath the camera so I'm not in its field of vision. I yank the yellow wire out - that's the tampering alarm - then the red to disable the power feed."<br/><br/>Then each other player plays a card, face down, to show what they think of the narration: good narration earns lots of stars, bad narration earns no stars or bombs. Add one card, randomly dealt, from the pack.<br/><br/>Then turn the cards over. Bomb cards eliminate star cards, as follows:
<ul>
<li>If there are any one-bomb cards, take away all the one-star cards</li>
<li>If there are any two-bomb cards, take away all the two-star cards</li>
<li>and if there are any three-bomb cards, take away all the three-star cards</li>
</ul>
If the number of stars left is equal to or greater than the difficulty level, you win! If not, you lose.<br/><br/>That's it. It's not finished. I'm not quite sure how you get cards or how you refresh your hand: except that I don't want the hands to be <i>continuously</i> refreshed. Sometimes, I want a player holding one solitary bomb card in his hand, which he can't get rid of, and he knows will destroy the next challenge.<br/><br/>Can you either:<br/>1. Add to it (e.g. "There's an Alert Level, from 1 to 3. Before the cards are turned for each challenge, take away a number of cards equal to the Alert Level.")<br/>2. Tweak it (e.g. "Players don't get dealt cards. The other players give them cards as a reward for good narration outside of challenges."<br/>3. Ask me questions and I'll make up answers on the spot (e.g. "What happens when you run out of cards?")<br/>4. Make brilliant and incisive comments.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            I'm not sure a card mix/scarcity element goes well with a judging element.  I'm supposed to make a decision about the quality of another player's contribution, except when I can't.  Maybe this is a personal bias, but it seems like it would be unsatisfying.  Typically when mix/scarcity comes into play (I'm thinking about Memoir '44/Battle Lore), that's a tactical element you have to manage, but if you are making honest value judgments, you aren't managing your hand.                        </div>

                            Change it to 2 colors of dice in 3 sizes.<br/><br/>Everyone puts down a green d2, d4, or d6 depending on how much you like the narration.<br/>or a red d2, d4, or d6 if you dislike.<br/><br/>Roll all the dice.  Subtract red from green.  Result must beat difficulty number, for the action to prevail.<br/><br/>All dice rolled are lost.<br/><br/>--<br/>For each point by-which the difficulty number is beaten, the player attempting the action is rewarded a number of 'pips' equalling the (Difficulty #) x (number by-which the Diff# was exceeded).<br/><br/>As pips are accumulated, they can be traded-in for the corresponding dice-- when the player desires: (2 pips buys a d2, Four pips buys 2d2 or 1d4. Six pips buys 3d2, 1d2+1d4, or 1d6).  A d2 flip determines the color of the dice purchased.<br/><br/>Difficulty numbers range from -3 to +3.  Multiplying -3,-2,-1 and 0 by any 'number by which the Diff# was exceeded'... yields &lt;0, so no pips are ever rewarded for beating easy difficulty numbers.<br/><br/>No matter how much they lose, a player always keeps one last green d2 in their &lt;s&gt;hand pool.<br/><br/>(It seems like this economy will get off-course, but I can't quite figure out which direction/ or if that will be bad or merely amusing.)                        </div>

                            First, let me say I like the idea in the abstract, so realize that any criticism is just my attempt to be helpful. Now, I agree with Jason about the scarcity element, and I feel that the random card is incompatible with honest judging.<br/>
<br/>
Also, something seems off about the way bombs subtract from stars. Big bombs only take away big stars. So if there's a bunch of single stars, along with one triple bomb, the bomb has no effect. Maybe change it so that the total number of bombs subtracts from the total number of stars.                        </div>

                            Or, to make it more of a tactical game, you either have open hands (everyone can see everyone else's hand), or you have a group of cards in the middle of the table that each person picks from in order - and keep the 3 bombs/3 stars, 2 bombs/2 stars thing. So then it becomes a tactical decision. If there's a bunch of 2-star cards and only one 2-bomb card, whoever goes first has to decide whether they want to have the hosing power, or take the 2-bomb so that no-one else can use it (and maybe miss out on the 3-star cards), or leave it and take another card that he thinks might be better.<br><br>Other things to couple this with: everyone plays a card out of their hand to the center, and then you around and people pick cards; you get to keep unplayed cards that you pick (so, investing in big cards that aren't appropriate for the current round is a worthwhile stategy, and everyone will remember that you took the three-star, or whatever).<br/><br/>Hope some of that helps. I love the # of bombs only affects # of stars things, but only if it works in a way that makes that a chosen, rather than a random, distinction.                        </br></br></div>

                            I am inclined to disagree with Jason on the scarcity vs. judgement issue.  <br/><br/>It seems to me that the <i>rub</i> of the game, is that the more firmly<br/>you assert your opinion in any given instance; the more your hand is stacked against you<br/>getting to assert your opinion generally, in the future.<br/><br/>Excuse me if I'm stating the obvious, but I think the system would work best for backstabbing<br/>scenarios; such as 'Resevoir Dogs'.  Endorsing or curtailing someone's gambit when you do want to/ <br/>risks forcing you to bid against your own interests at a later, inopportune, time.    Players must<br/>strategize whether to stick their necks out or hoard influence.  And with hidden hands, bluffing is possible.                        </div>

                            Heh. Well, that's interesting, but not quite what I expected.<br/><br/>The idea is that it's a cooperative mechanic, not a backstabbing one. You <i>want</i> the other player to succeed, because then he disables the security camera, and then <i>you</i> can start picking the vault's lock.<br/><br/>So it's a bit like Breaking The Ice: you all want the same goal, so you'd <i>love</i> to be able to award the Three Star card, but you'll need to hear some good narration first. Also, there's an element of playing against the deck: you'd love to be able to award the Three Star card, but you don't have it: you've only got a One Star or a Bomb.<br/><br/>The Bomb cards are meant to be hot potatoes. You don't want them. You'd love not to play them, but if it's your only card, you'll have to. And if it's a choice between a Bomb and a Three Star, and the narration's bad, you'll have to play the bomb.<br/><br/>It's interesting that it comes across as a backstabbing mechanic. Hmm.<br/><br/>You're giving me a lot to digest here, which is great. Some comments about the scarcity / judgement thing in a moment (after I've tried to get through this level of Bully again).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            (Finished the level. It was hard.)<br/><br/>So, on the scarcity thing. There's a couple of things I really like about it.<br/><br/>Note that there'll usually be a choice to make. Most of the time, there'll be a choice between three or four different cards. Even if there's only two cards, there'll usually be a choice between the two, so you can signify good narration or bad narration. Now, that choice might be between two or three stars or between a bomb and a star, but there's still a choice.<br/><br/>This has a couple of effects. Firstly, it introduces an element of randomness. The most brilliant narrator in the world can't guarantee everyone will give him three stars. Often, he'll only get two; rarely, he'll get a bomb. <br/><br/>Secondly, it gives permission to play the low cards. If you narrate, and someone plays a bomb, it doesn't mean they hated your narration: perhaps they had no choice. Besides, you've got to play the bombs <i>sometime</i>. <br/><br/>By the way, the technique with the bombs is to dispose of them when they'll do least harm. So, if you have a One Bomb card, the best time to dispose of it is during a <i>brilliant</i> piece of narration. Everyone else will play Two Stars and Three Stars and, so, there'll be no One Star cards for the bomb to eliminate. So there's an element of guessing what everyone else will play. And I like that.<br/><br/>(This raises the interesting question of whether you can play two cards at once, of course, which could be very appropriate with Bomb cards).<br/><br/>Thanks for all the ideas so far. If I haven't commented on them specifically, it doesn't  mean I've ignored them: they've provoked a lot of thought. As you can probably tell, I've thought myself into a corner with this mechanic, and this is helping me organise my thoughts.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I suspect that in play "quality of narration" judgment would go out the window, tacitly or not, in favor of group tactical decisions.

                            A couple of thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
Don't use a deck per se, but rather a fixed hand -- like the initiative cards in El Grande.  Each player has a deck and can play any of the cards in it.  But once that 3stars is gone, well, you need to refresh.<br/>
<br/>
Introduce some sort of 'groupthink' mechanic -- "oh, so you thought that was worth 2 stars when the rest of the group assigned a 1 bomb?"  There needs to be a ramification for that.  (What that ramification is I don't have a clue).<br/>
<br/>
Borrow from the anti-pool.  Refresh on failure.                        </div>

                            Jason,
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I suspect that in play "quality of narration" judgment would go out the window, tacitly or not, in favor of group tactical decisions.  Would this lead to a downward spiral in narration quality?  Not sure.  I wouldn't feel compelled to rock the house if I knew that people were managing theirhands to mitigate harm anyway.</blockquote>
Hmm. The idea here is to go for a Breaking The Ice-style vibe. You know how, in that game, it's <i>tactically</i> worth your while to give more dice,  but usually you'll wait for good narration before you do? And maybe sometimes you'll be more lenient with dice, because you want an extra attraction level, but usually you won't?<br><br>(Mind you, this mechanic works slightly differently from BtI. With this mechanic, if you hear bad narration, you <i>rate it as bad</i>. In BtI, if you hear bad narration, you <i>wait until you hear good narration</i> before giving a die. So that's worth thinking about.)<br><br>My feeling, from playing around with packs of cards, is that the ratio of stars to bombs plays a big part in whether you'll play tactically. If half your hand consists of bombs, then of course you play tactically to get rid of them. If you have one bomb in your hand, you can relax more, using the various star cards to reward good narration, and switching into tactical mode quickly to dispose of the bomb.<br><br>Still, you may have a point, and I'm still thinking this through, so any further thoughts are welcome.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Robert, yes, that's a great idea. It makes playing a Bomb a positive thing. For a more co-operative vibe, you could make the rewards communal (Bomb 3: Play this card and everyone receives two extra cards).<br/><br/>That might solve my problem with refreshes, too. Nice. Thanks.<br/><br/>Oh, hey, Curly, that mechanic you whispered to me? That's fascinating. Still thinking about it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Darcy, refresh on failure, of course. I should have thought of that myself.<br/><br/>Not sure about Group Think. To an extent, the Bombs do that: if you want to play one, you have to guess how the other players will rate the narration, and then play accordingly. And I'd like players to vote on the narration without worrying what everyone else will vote. But I see where you're coming from.<br/><br/>Could you explain more about the fixed hand thing? I don't quite understand.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I had a recent experience with Contenders, Graham, where the fast and furious card play resulted in clipped and uninspiring narration - there were games going on on two levels, and the "narrative" level got short shrift.  Something to be aware of, although card handling seems to be not very complex in your game. <br/><br/>The more I consider the "tactical over narrative" issue I raised, the less I think it is an issue, particularly with the BtI example.  A solid example of how you expect play to proceed in the rules ought to take care of it.                        </div>

                            I think that the objection Jason raised is correct. If there were some sort of tension between wanting to succeed, and wanting to reward narration, it might work. But it seems to me that these things both work in the same direction here. That is, I'm not seeing why anyone would, given the opportunity, reward tactical movement forward with less stars.<br/>
<br/>
That said, this might not be important. I'd say forget about the "narration" criteria. Just tell the player, "Here's your cards, you can play any of them on any contest at your whim for any reason you like."<br/>
<br/>
One thing you haven't made clear is why it is that at times somebody will have to get rid of the bomb card that they're holding. Unless it's simply that you don't get a new hand until you play all of your cards. That might work. Though one problem with such games is that there's a strong incentive to collude here, with no player involved having an incentive to detect it. That is players might just lay their hands down, and figure out how to get through play by applying the bombs at the right times to mitigate damage. Even if the rules say not to do so. Unless there's a GM or something to "catch" them at it.<br/>
<br/>
It might do to put some sort of competitive element in the game.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Jason's original objection doesn't stand, as you've noted. The judgment here isn't "This is a three star narration." It's "Hmm, I have a two bomb, and a two star card here...which does this current narration merit." It means that you have to be considering the narration in the context of all others. Otherwise it's far too easy to just give your players the three star every time, or the three bomb if you're feeling nasty. With a limited hand, you have to consider the pacing of your play.<br/>

                            Where do the challenges come from?

                            Annie is completely right.<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn't have used the term "fixed hand", but rather "fixed deck" with a set distribution of stars and bombs.  El Grande uses a 14-card deck (numbered 1-14), where the cards are used to bid for initiative (and in an inverse relationship, mechanical oomph).<br/>
<br/>
I envisioned a set-up where you'd cycle your deck based on the system, and refresh it based on other factors.<br/>
<br/>
