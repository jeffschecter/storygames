The biweekly Wednesday night was our collective brainchild, basically so we could play a bunch of games.  He runs a DnD 4 campaign and publishes lots of great material for it on the Return to Northmoor podcast, which is pretty popular.<br/></li><li> Chris; another long time GM (DnD, CoC, a little BW) who forms the core of the Wednesday night group.  He has a tendency to made the sidekick, comic relief characters that are a little teflon-coated in terms of grabbiness. I wanted him in a PTA game to get him out of that habit.<br/></li><li> Randy; a long time gaming friend of mine. He's played in a number of the games I've run over the years, ranging from Amber and d20 to Dogs, PTA, Sorcerer, and SotC.  He recalls the last PTA game we played quite fondly, though we didn't finish the season due to time constraints.<br/></li><li> Meera, whom I know mostly through Amber gaming. She's a long time GM, but it's almost all diceless freeform, so when I say "She's GM'd a lot of PTA seasons", understand that I mean "In the car, while driving, sans dice or cards, using the "TV aesthetic", Traits, and Screen presence as general guide to what happens"... and not "she knows how many Traits recover when you have a Personal Set scene." </li></ul>\nPitch sessions for PTA are always strange beasts, because people come in to the session with random ideas for shows, almost none of which ever make it through the whole process, and by the end, you have something pretty cool that everyone\u2019s excited about\u2026 and no one\u2019s entirely sure how it happened.<br/><br/>So here\u2019s what happened THIS time.<br/><br/>First, I was running a little late from a class I was teaching, so we got going around six-thirty or so.  I had a notebook in my pocket with a few pitch ideas, and not much else.<br/><br/>So we chatted a little bit and then I asked everyone what kind of television show they <em>didn\u2019t</em> want to see / do.  Tim said that he really wasn\u2019t much into the idea of a \u2019straight\u2019 one-hour dramedy like <em>Gilmore Girls</em> or <em>Felicity</em> or something like that.  No one looked too disappointed by that - I think we\u2019re the sort of folks who expect a little genre weirdness in our TV.  Cool.<br/><br/>Meera spoke up and requested we avoid setting things in any war between the Amercian Civil War and today, simply because her history-fu for that time frame was weak.  Again, that sounded good to everyone (for myself, I was merely homesick for the \u201cStrange Allies\u201d PTA game we never finished.)<br/><br/>That was pretty much all the \u201cI\u2019d rather not\u201ds for everyone, so we talked a bit about what kind of pitches we had.<br/><br/>Randy piped up (a bit tongue in cheek) with the idea I dubbed \u201cLeft Behind\u2026 Because You\u2019re An Asshole\u201d, where something akin to the Biblical Rapture occurs, but only people who are, objectively, good people actually transcend.<br/><br/>We talked a little bit around this topic, until I admitted that, while I liked the idea of a kind of \u201coh crap, all these people are gone, how will we survive?\u201d event, the idea of an event with biblical elements left me pretty cold.<br/><br/>Tim jumped in and said he was also into the idea of a kind of a post-apocalyptic survival story, though not just \u201cstraight zombies\u201d in the vein of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, which is an idea I\u2019d mentioned earlier in the week.<br/><br/>((I\u2019d like to pat us all on the back at this point for not mentioning the Swine Flu once the whole night.))<br/><br/>Right around that same point, Tim also mentioned that he enjoyed \u201cresource drama\u201d - where you\u2019re scrounging for supplies and making do with whatever you can find.  The A-Team was mentioned, which is a little too camp for me, but also elements of Mad Max and things of that nature.<br/><br/>We threw around a lot of Survival Drama at this point, and talked about the kinds of story arcs you could do in there: a hellbent run from Point A to Point Z, basic survival, defend the base, find a weakness of and destroy the Big Bad\u2026 things like that.<br/><br/>I thought it might be interesting to start well AFTER the initial \u201cinciting event,\u201d and Tim agreed, mentioning that flashbacks would certainly explore that event more.<br/><br/>So we tossed around ideas of what the apocalypse might have been.  Zombies\u2026 vampires\u2026 dragons\u2026 robots\u2026 robots created to fight zombies (yes, seriously), then turning on their owners\u2026<br/><br/>Somewhere in there, Tim commented that some kind of Faerie Attack had never been done as an Apocalypse Event, and I said something like \u201cWell, then we should do that.\u201d<br/><br/>(I believe Meera would like me to state, for the record, that the faeries were not her idea\u2026 she just (gleefully) went along with it.)<br/><br/><a href="http://random-average.com/PrimetimeAdventures/Ironwall" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" height="368" src="http://random-average.com/uploads/PrimetimeAdventures/ironwall.png" width="300"/></a><br/><br/>That seemed to provide quite a lightning rod for ideas after that point, and coalesced into a show concept that The Producer is tentatively calling <em><strong>Ironwall</strong></em> (until we think of something yet more awesome).<br/><br/>(continued)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208487/#Comment_208487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T07:21:07+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  7:21AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2009 7:29AM by Doyce.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SOMETHING had caused the Fae to reemerge in our world, and those fae (a collective term that we decided encompassed everything from fairies and pixies to trolls and dragons to bakemono and oni \u2014 all presented in the style of Hellboy II and Pan\u2019s Labyrinth\u2019s art team) were Very Angry.  The result of this re-emergence was hundreds of millions if not billions dead (either from fae attacks or from jumping off bridges when they realize that the bogeyman is real).<br/><br/>We tossed around several ideas about WHY they had come back, including:\n<ul>\n<li>The bio-organism of Earth was calling on its last, most vicious defenders, having failed through the \u2018fever\u2019 of Global Warming to control the human disease.  \u201cGiant T-cells shaped like Unicorns,\u201d Meera quipped.<br/></li><li>There was a regime shift in Faerie and the new King really hated us (a la <em>The Golden Army</em>).<br/></li><li>The thousand-year treaty (involving a drunk Irishman, the King of the Fae, and a lost poker bet) finally ran out.<br/></li><li>Old iron railway tracks had been torn up, reconnecting long-severed ley lines.<br/></li><li>Nanites run amok. (which we didn\u2019t exactly love)<br/></li><li>Starbuck is an angel.<br/></li></ul>\n\u2026 and in the end we decided it didn\u2019t matter, or that it would come out during the show itself.  The basic idea was that humanity was on the ropes, hiding out in the ruins of big cities, where the Iron content was high enough to weaken the fae magic.  Something had recently happened to put the status quo in danger, and Our Heroes would be doing something about it.<br/><br/>Tim asked what would be happening that would bring the characters together, and Randy came up with a pretty awesome idea (and the First Scene of the Pilot): somehow the Fae had made it into the City (tentatively, Manhattan - Detroit would work better, but we know nothing about Detroit) where the Settlement was and had swapped in EVERYONE\u2019S children for Changelings.  The \u201cFirst Scene\u201d idea for the Pilot is all these adults dragging their crying, screaming children into the middle of the settlement and throwing them into a bonfire, where the audience finally sees that the people in the hoods and robes are not the bad guys, and that the things in the fire are monsters.<br/><br/>That opening scene lets us do a lot of stuff during the pilot:\n<ul>\n<li>Explain what the Fae can do with glamours and illusion and the like.<br/></li><li>Visit a fae stronghold and see how the bad guys roll.<br/></li><li>Show off the characters in an action-type situation.<br/></li><li>Get everyone asking questions like \u201cHow could they do this? Why didn\u2019t they do it before? WHAT HAS CHANGED AND HOW SCREWED ARE WE?!\u201d<br/></li></ul>\n\u2026 which is basically everything a Pilot is supposed to do.<br/><br/>There was a bit more background stuff, during which it became clear that SEX was going to be a big element of the story, because the Fey need humanity to refresh their bloodlines (and humans\u2026 well, are human, and the Fae are hot and sexy).   Plus, Tim made \u201cSex with Fairies\u201d his character\u2019s main Issue. I wrote all that background stuff down in the Series Bible on the<a href="http://random-average.com/PrimetimeAdventures/Ironwall" rel="nofollow"> Wiki page</a>, so check it out.<br/><br/>Then we came up with characters:\n<ul>\n<li>Tim is playing a kind of mechanic-savant with natural animal sex appeal whose Issue is temptation: specifically, sex with faeries: *gasp* SLEEPING WITH THE (hawt) ENEMY.<br/></li><li>Meera is playing a girl whose black magic led her to cut some pretty unspeakable bargains when the fae first arrived. Her issue is Atonement.<br/></li><li>Randy is playing a border guard for the settlement - someone who survived another settlement in a smaller town being wiped out.  He has issues with control, born of concern for protecting the settlement.<br/></li><li>And Chris is playing a young man who was taken in by the settlement\u2019s priest when he was a young boy and who has grown up as a pillar of the community.  His issue is Self-Worth, because <strong>HE IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FAE, A LYING LITTLE CHANGELING THAT HIS \u201cPARENTS\u201d DIDN\u2019T HAVE THE GUTS TO KILL.</strong><br/></li></ul>\nAhem.<br/><br/>So\u2026 right. Pretty much nothing at all like any of the pitch ideas we\u2019d been thinking of, pretty cool\u2026 and no one really knows how we got there.<br/><br/>I was rather excited to play.  The pilot episode was last night. I'll talk about it in the next post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208508/#Comment_208508" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T08:17:31+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  8:17AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm somewhat disappointed that this wasn't, really, about playing fae in the postapocalyptic horrors of the elven holocaust.<br/><br/>Other then that: Fucking awesome.

It's the front of a train station, and you can see in the firelight that it's Grand Central Terminal, except "Grand" and "Terminal" are gone -- it's just dirty shadows of those words on the wall, and the only part of the sign left is "Central."  There are torches lighting things up, and some BIG fire down below, which the camera is still sliding down toward.  We ease past a big hairy goat head that's on fire, jammed on top of a light post -- if this is New York, it has seen better days, but we know that from the ads we've been seeing on HBO, don't we?<br/><br/>We finally get the camera low enough to see the action on the street, and it's pretty much an organized mob scene.  People are shouting, some are struggling... okay, it looks like most of the struggling is kids of various sizes, and sometimes their parents.  The people hauling them along are dressed like everyone else, except they're all wearing metal-looking armbands.  How comforting.<br/><br/>Armband guys are dragging the kids into a big group in front of... yeah, the big bonfire, where <b>some soot-smeared guy</b> is riling up the crowd with lots of angry word-things. Rhetoric. Like that.  He's shouting about The Law, and how all Changelings must be purged out before they Destroy Us.  He doesn't look like he entirely buys it, though.  Also, he's pretty, in a anvil-jaw kind of way.  He's maybe the first protag for the show.  I haven't seen him in anything else.<br/><br/>I also haven't seen this <b>Morgan Le Fey-looking red head</b> who's lurking around the edges of the kid-crowd, searching faces.  Looks like she's looking for someone.  Another armband guy comes by with a younger girl in his arms, and she stops him to peer at her face.  While she's doing that, you hear someone off screen shout "Dammit, it BIT me!" and the soldier boy looks at the noise, his eyes widen, and he hands the girl to The Redhead, says something like "Hold this for a second" and runs off to help.  The Redhead and the girl stare at each other.<br/><br/>The girl's eyes get all sneaky and grown-up looking. "I know you! I know what you want! I can help you! Get me out of here!"  <br/><br/>The show used up its budget of whispered exclamation points in one line.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>MEANWHILE, someone unconscionably pretty is looking on the whole scene from the side, up on some steps -- maybe from across the street. It's... okay, it's John Rhys Meyers with something like a sexy flattop haircut.  Standing next to him is a kind-faced old man, dressed like a priest.<br/><br/>The old guy asks what John Rhys Meyers is thinking, and calls him "son", so yeah... priest.  Meyers says "I was thinking: 'what have we done?'"   The old guy says "we are helping, if we can".  We hear more commotion indicating that the kids have gone all feral bitey-bitey, and Meyers looks at the old guy, who gives him a 'go do something' chin nod, and he sighs and runs toward the big crowd.  Armband guys are separating the big crowd of kids and handing them out to nearby people.<br/><br/>Meyers gets one handed to him by... Bill Paxton? Paxton says something like "watch his teeth", and Meyers holds the kid at arm length.<br/><br/>The kids eyes get big.  "It's you!"<br/><br/>Meyers looks... really scared and confused.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>Now we're with an armband-guy, standing in silhouette in a doorway of a house.  In the room is a mother standing between armband guy and her kids; a couple boys about kickball-game tall.  Her husband's there too, giving good brood.  Armband guy steps into the light... and it's Viggo Mortensen. Seriously?  There not going to have any budget left for effects after this casting call.  Maybe it's just for the pilot, but damn.<br/><br/>The mother is shaking her head and saying 'no no no' and Viggo McArmband looks all soft in the eyes and sympathetic.  The husband steps up to him and asks if they really have to check this, and Viggo assures them it's just to be sure, and he knows it'll come to nothing.  He goes down on a knee to get eye level to the mom, and they look at each other with one of those "million-terrabyte-data-transfer" looks, and he says "Come on, Sis, it'll be okay."  He kind of moves her out of the way, with her whispering "okay" semi-hysterically.<br/><br/>But the boys are NOT okay, they try to bolt, and their dad has to haul them over to Viggo, who's reassuring them that it's just a touch of iron, and they can go back to bed.  We see his hand, where he has some kind of heavy iron ring on every hand, or it's a kind of brass knuckles - iron knuckles, whatever.<br/><br/>Viggo looks kind and reassuring, and he takes one of the kid's arms, and just holds the rings to the arm, and we watch his face, and hear some kind of sizzling, and we see Viggo's face go totally stone-cold as the mom goes kind of hysterical in the background.  He reaches for the other kid, does the same thing, and every ounce of life drains out of his face. Viggo is scary.  His hands wrap around the boys throats, his fingers tighten on their necks, and he says "Where are they?"<br/><br/><strong>COMMERCIAL BREAK</strong> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208598/#Comment_208598" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T13:55:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  1:55PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2009 1:55PM by Doyce.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>[[CONFLICT:  What does everyone want?<br/>* JOSEPH (the pretty boy) wants to find out what the changeling boy knows about him -- who he is... something about his own history.

He steps into a doorway in a building, and suddenly the door is a stone wall that matches the rest of the building.   Apparently, the Prettyboy is MAGIC.<br/><br/>Inside the now-private alcove, he turns on the kid and turns on the Interrogate.  The wide-eyed kid-thing says something like "You're one of us. The FIRST one of us. The one we all hope to emulate!"<br/><br/>But what does that mean?<br/><br/>"You're the KERRIGAN."<br/><br/>Ohhh... the Kerrigan... wait... what? I don't --<br/><br/>Something that the kid says makes prettyboy forget his little fake-wall illusions, and it fades, and an armband guy walks by and says "Here, I'll take him back, Joseph," and he does that, and Joseph is left a lot like Redhead -- wanting to ask more, but afraid to give himself away.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>Viggo (who the husband... I guess his brother-in-law, calls "Len") is still half-choking the boys and saying "tell me when you took them, tell me where they are, and I. Will. Take. You. To. The. Park."   He says this as though he is making a big compromise, and being a real stand-up guy, but it sounds a little creepy.<br/><br/>Some younger woman who looks a little like the crying mom comes in through the open door.  She looks a little badass. She's got a metal armband.  She takes in the scene, asks what's going on, then says "Len?" and catches the marks on the boys arms and he face goes from angry-confused to angry-sad.<br/><br/>"How do you know it wasn't years ago?" says one kid. "Maybe we've been here for years..." says the other.  They totally out-creep the "take you to the park" offer.<br/><br/>"I'm offering you a way out of here," *Len* says. "You should take it."<br/><br/>"Len," says younger armband woman. "They're coming."<br/><br/>"Awwww," says one kid. "You don't want to see these faces get hurt.  You really *love* them. That's aDORable."  The other one leans in and says "You get to watch them burn."<br/><br/>The woman-girl says "Len" again, and then there are some silhouettes at the door, asking if everything is okay.  We watch Len's face while he angsts over what to do, and can hear the girl-woman Han Soloing the guys outside the door, but he says "No," stands up, drags the boys outside amidst hysterical older-sister-wails, and tells the other two armbands "these two have both been switched."<br/><br/>Then he drags both of them. To the fire. Personally.  Damn.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>All the kids (not ALL the kids, but all the kids that are going to get burned) have been gathered up, and the first guy repeats the thing about All Changelings Get Burned or We All Die, and then the cage around the bonfire opens up, and all these kids are thrown in, and the door gets pushed shut, and there's burning.<br/><br/>Now, the babies going on the fire turn out to chunks of wood, not living things, so that's okay, but the bigger kids are ... something else. Their faces get all long and their skin turns weird-colors and their ears and fingers are super long and they are clearly NOT kids.  Some scream, but some of them dance around.<br/><br/>The dancing ones dance faster and faster, and get brighter and brighter, and there's this crazybright flash and the fireballs of evil kid fly into the sky and arc off into the sky like big bottle rockets... all going kind of the same direction, and not coming down.<br/><br/>"Len" watches them go, his eyes big, then he yanks out a big knife, stabs the ground between his feet, and scrapes a line in the stone that follows the direction those fireball kids went.  In the background we can see that the non-dancing evil kids have keeled over and died.<br/><br/>He looks up at the fire-trails again, checks his mark on the ground, and shouts "Bring me a compass!" over his shoulder.<br/><br/><b>COMMERCIAL BREAK</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208599/#Comment_208599" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T13:57:31+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  1:57PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -=-<br/><br/><b>Sienna</b> is in her house, and it looks like she's tossing things in the garbage. Weird things. Fancy knives. Bits of cloth and paper and feathers and whatever else will make us think "Magic Supplies."<br/><br/>There's suddenly a asexual "man" in the room with her, tsking and saying things like "Oh, you shouldn't throw all that away."<br/><br/>Sienna disagrees -- all that 'this' has ever done has hurt people and cost her.  Better to just be rid of it.<br/><br/>Mr. Asexy (cast list online calls him "Blackwing", so apparently he's a faerie man... or someone's old DnD character) points out that she's also one of the best weapons "your people" have, even if they don't know it... and might throw her on a fire of her own even if they did.  In any case, she's just feeling sorry for herself, moping about when she is perhaps the only one who can tell where those changelings went, and why. Sienna kvetches that if she did figure that out, they'd know what she was. He points that she lives about four minutes' walk from the largest library still held by mortals, and that a little research provides any explanations she requires... and, again, she should just suck it up and quit moping.  She looks a little shamed at that, and starts putting things back.  He starts to nag her a bit more, and she orders him away.  Wonder of wonder, he goes with a little bow. Sassy.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/><b>Lennox</b> goes back and faces the wrath of his family, which is pretty wrath-y.  The sister who is the kid's mom is pretty much in a coma, but the younger sister with the armband is laying into him pretty good.  Lennox asks the brother in law (Brom? It sounded like his name was Brom) and the angry-sis (C-something. Cecille?  The mom-sister is Cordelia, so two C's is confusing...) if either of them know who would know about changelings and what the bottle rocket imitation was all about, and where the real boys might be.  They look at each other like they all know the answer.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>And we're watching the <b>handsome rabble rouser from the bonfire</b>, who is now walking along a dark street with seriously cracked pavement, overgrown with plants and flowers and trees.  A cat slinks across his path, followed a few seconds later by a coyote or fox or something.<br/><br/>He stops as the street opens up and the moon falls on an open grassy space with ... well, trees and vegetation... maybe farmed land... I don't know. And it's dark.  He's searching this open area with his eyes and kind of has a junkie expression -- like he wants someone to be there, but at the same time he doesn't.<br/><br/>Another fox type critter is running out of the open area. (Is my NYC geography wrong, or would that be uber-natured Central Park?)  About halfway to him, it does something shifty and looks like a short little goblin guy, and keeps running toward us.  The guy steps back into an alley to hide, but the gnome-looking thing pulls up at the alley and sniffs, and sniffs some more, and finally says "I know you're there, Cam; She wants to see you."  And yes, he was saying She, not she - you could hear it.<br/><br/><b>Cam</b> says something about how he's surprised that the faeries in Central Park haven't bugged out, since his friends just has a changeling barbecue down the street.  The little guy (cast list says Fiezel) says they had nothing to do with it, as could be clearly told by the way some of them 'escaped' at the end.  He mentions again that "She" wants to see Cam.<br/><br/>Cam looks torn, like a recovering alcoholic offered a drink after a really bad day.  There's more foot-dragging, but he follows the little guy back into the wilds of The Park.<br/><br/>(Hey: "The Park."  With fairies in it.  This would be where Lennox was promising to take the fake-nephews if they gave up the goods.  So... okay, yeah, a good offer.  Also: if faeries are bad mojo, why are Our Heroes living like... 10 blocks from a bunch of them?)<br/><br/>Gnome-boy leads our Cam into a ... well, it's bower. I barely know what that word means, but it's clearly a bower.  We see the silhouette of some woman kissing some other figure goodbye, then the woman figure comes around into Cam's waiting space and ... it's Michelle <em>Pfeiffer</em>. Seriously: did they get a 22-episode budget and blow it on a six-episode mini-series?  My god.<br/><br/>So Cam and her circle around each other, sparring words and <em><strong>CLEARLY</strong></em> just killing time until they get to the Sex. Cam is maybe in denial about it, but oh yeah - they're going to at it real soon, and this is HBO, so we get to watch.   Cam's moaning about some hold she has on him; she says it's love; he asks if that's even possible for her; she looks mock-affronted - surely the Queen of Flowers can feel love? She offers him wine; he asks if THAT'S how she keeps him coming back; she smiles that he knows exactly why he comes ... back.  The audience smirks.<br/><br/>[[<strong>CONFLICT</strong>: Cam wants proof that the reason he succumbs to the Queen is not him... but something she's <em>doing</em> to him.  He only draws a few cards, but beats the GM anyway. GM narrates.]]<br/><br/>Queen Michelle says that even if she'd drugged the wine, he's still enjoying himself, so what's the harm?  He shakes his head, and says he gives up for now - he's beat that bush enough.  She disagrees with the best line so far.  "Oh, I <em>must</em> disagree."  The camera pulls back, and while it looks as though they've been pacing around each other, we realize they've been steadily getting closer closer until they're practically wearing each other clothes.  Then they drink a slug of the wine, then they get rid of the clothes, and lo, there is a mighty bush-beating.

We get a little more visual of the city, even though it's night time... whatever river this is, most of the bridges are gone -- we can see two suspension bridges that are nothing but the pylons.  Joseph isn't looking at that, though -- he's looking up in the sky, and then we short-flash on the face of that fake-kid saying "You're the first, one of use, the Kerrigan..." et cetera.<br/><br/>He turns to a tree that's growing on the roof where he's standing, and waves his hands over the bark, like he's sketching in sand with a fingertip.  We see a face appear in the tree, details added with each handwave, until we see an image of some kind of faerie face... probably <strong>HIS</strong> face, if he looked like a faerie, and not like a human.  Maybe how he looks 'for real?'  If so, why not just drop whatever disguise he's got on, and show that? Curious.<br/><br/>Pretty Boy's in denial.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/><strong>COMMERCIAL BREAK</strong><br/><br/><strong>-=-</strong><br/><br/>Morning: grey, rainy morning, and we're in a fancy old library. Sienna is sitting at a table covered in open books, and the old priest guy is there too.  She calls him "Father", so yeah... priest.  Lennox-Viggo comes in with a couple other Iron Armband guys (one of which is Bill Paxton), and the priest has them sit down.<br/><br/>Pretty Boy Joshua shows up and the priest greets him by name. He replies "Hi Dad," and sits next to him.  Dad? Not.. priest? Priest and Dad, both?<br/><br/>Or... no. Joshua is maybe one of the changeling things... so... raised by the priest for a long time?  That works.  The Catholic Church welcoming those of Alternate Lifestyles, though? Weird.<br/><br/>The priest checks to make sure that everyone's there for the Morning Exposition, but no, we're missing...<br/><br/>Cam walks in, looking like he was rode hard and put away... well... yeah.<br/><br/>Now we can start.<br/><br/>EXPOSITION: Lemme sum up.<br/><br/>Based on the faerie tales in All These Big Old Books, changelings can be swapped in for kids. They knew this.  Usually, there's never so many. Maybe one, ever, but it looks like they Fey swapped in damn near all the kids in "Central".<br/><br/>When a changeling is dropped in a fire, they're supposed to "jump out of the chimney and back to the child they replaced"... there was no chimney on the Big Bonfire of Fake Babies, but the same idea holds.<br/><br/>So... the ones whose replacement kids were out there to return to... they were the ones that blasted off. The ones that stayed in the fire and died... those kids are already dead.  Still: that's like two-thirds of the kids, still alive as of last night.<br/><br/>So they need to go get the kids. Based on Lennox and the compass thing, they no the direction as the crow flies, and can guess distance, and Sienna has some solid guesses on where to go to find The Hill.<br/><br/>The Hill? Oh yeah, the kids are totally inside a Faerie Mound.<br/><br/>Cam says he knows most of the faerie mounds near the island (we just bet you do, Cam), and there aren't that direction. Priest guy says that's true - it's probably 4 or 5 days on foot... or they could go faster on the rails...<br/><br/>... if only they knew someone who could get one of the train engines running again.<br/><br/>Everyone looks at Cam.  Ahh. That's why they waited for him.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>We see the same basic group walking across a big iron bridge (The Hellgate) and walking to a big train yard (in what would be Brooklyn).  Cam looks things over, makes a serious -man-work-face, and says "Gimme a day... and bring me these supplies."<br/><br/>*Cue A-team montage.*<br/><br/>We see the repairs going on, with everyone chipping in.  Joseph looks sicker and sicker as the day goes on, which we see sort of side-ways explained when someone mentions scraping rust off of all these trains and into satchels to use "in their Hill", because the Faeries hate iron.<br/><br/>Right, so if Joshua is a faerie, this whole day sucks for him.  Come to think of it, he looked pretty bad just crossing the big iron bridge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208601/#Comment_208601" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T13:59:25+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  1:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2009 2:00PM by Doyce.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...<br/><br/><b><i>I'm sorry, the show is great, and the game was great, but if I keep this detail-level for the AP going, the summary will be about 8000 words, and I don't have that much time, so a faster summary of the last two acts...</i><br/></b><br/><br/><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act Three</span></strong><br/><br/>Our heroes and appropriate numbers of redshirt NPCs head over the Hellgate bridge and north up the tracks.<br/><br/>[[There is a <strong>conflict</strong> between Cam and Lennox in which Cam wants to prove to Lennox that he can be relied on and not micromanaged, and Lennox wants to prove to everyone that he should be leading missions like this.

The duke knows him, bemoans the fact that Joseph has "gone native" and seemingly forgotten who he is but "reassures" Joseph that despite all that, Joseph has still accomplished everything they'd hoped.  Joseph wants to know more, but the Duke says that while he's served Joseph's line for a thousand years, he's not dying here... more explanations will be forthcoming from <strong>their agent within the settlement</strong>.

I had 19 budget (four players, all with Screen Presence 2, so (8x2)+3. The conflicts broke down like so.<br/><br/>First conflict, during the bonfire scene, involved Sienna, Lennox, and Joseph. Cam didn't have anything conflicty going on.  <br/><br/>I dropped 5 budget on this, to get Fan Mail rolling, but with so many involved players, it was a very 'efficient' use of budget.  Technically, I could have run each person's conflict separately, but instead I cut back and forth between each player until everyone was at a conflict point, and then did one big group draw.  In some cases, this might be 'cheating', but in all three cases, the initial "bang" was really "will I make a deal with a changeling and sneak him off, allowing him to live?", so it felt right in this case.<br/><br/>In the second round of scenes, during which each player requested a scene, there was only one Conflict (with Cam, versus The Queen of Flowers).  Sienna with Blackwing, Len with his extended family, and Joshua by himself -- no conflicts there.<br/><br/>The library scene and the scene getting a train engine running were both without conflicts, though we perhaps could have had one with Joshua convincing Cam that the reason he was looking crappy on the train was due to motion sickness. As it was, they'd already played it out before the thought occurred to me.<br/><br/>The 'crash' on the tracks was a conflict involving Cam and Len.  That was actually the only hitch in the momentum of the game for the night: Cam announced he wanted a conflict to convince Len that he was competent and didn't need Len looming over his shoulder all the time.  We hadn't really been playing that, it was just sort of assumed with Len's Issue, so Len's player was sort of at a loss as to what HE would want in that conflict... and kept suggesting something like "well, if I win, that doesn't happen?"  I knew that that would be a problem of logic if they BOTH won, so I kept pushing for stakes that could both win or both fail without anything breaking -- we finally settled on Cam getting Len to back off and Len trying to look and feel like a Leader... which, ironically, they both failed.<br/><br/>The search for a way to repair the train was a Conflict involving all four players... the first time we really see all four PCs acting as a team in the show, which Cam's player was keen on playing up.<br/><br/>The fight in The Hill was one big Conflict on which I blew 5 budget.<br/><br/>The escape from The Hill was a "chase-scene" style conflict involving all four players, and I think 4 budget on that..<br/><br/>In the end, I still had 2 or 3 budget -- stuff that had bounced back to me from spent Fan Mail in the final two scenes -- but it was late, and we had our show in the can, so the three extra chips got pocketed by the Producer for high-end hookers and celebratory blow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208702/#Comment_208702" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T07:17:08+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  7:17AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Parenthetically: I never really felt like I was low on budget at any point in the session, and in hindsight I think that was because almost all my conflicts - all but one - involved all or all-but-one of the players.  A good trick to remember, I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
