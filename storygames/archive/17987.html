This serial killer had been going around extracting people's livers and Agent Flint had "her" subdued and in custody, but when he came back to the cell, all they ever found of her was a puddle of what turned out to be latex exterior paint in the colors of her skin, hair, and clothing. <br/><br/>Jr. had given himself over to the mysterious tome that he carries around with him everywhere (strangely enough, no one seems to notice it unless he has it open) which is the source of his Dark Side (tagged with Hallucinations, Secrets, and Poor Impulse Control), and it ordered him to assist this horrific creature in disguising itself as an ordinary human woman. The book's author was none other than Dominick Alves, Sr.<br/><br/>Let me know if you have any other questions or can help me decide how to frame this right! Also, it'd be super if we could get Dominick, Sr.'s flamethrower into play somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406517/#Comment_406517" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T11:35:25+00:00" title="February 18, 2013 11:35AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm...I haven't MC'd any of the *World games, but of them, I'd be most comfortable with Monsterhearts, probably because 90% of the opposition is PVP, so I'd be mostly scene framing and asking questions, with less prep needed.

I've run it more than a dozen times and have several mysteries I've worked up.<br/><br/>I usually start with a monster or supernatural threat that sounds fun. You don't have to reinvent the wheel here. If werewolves sound fun, write a mystery with werewolves. You may want a twist. Say, these are demonic-style werewolves. People possessed by demons of the hunt, or something. So instead of silver, you need blessed or holy weapons to damage them. I am really fond of nigh-invulnerable monsters.<br/><br/>The Keeper Reference Sheet is a good procedural for creating mysteries, which you can follow almost like filling out a playbook. I leave spaces when I get stuck and just come back later.<br/><br/>The next most important thing to me is the Countdown. I need to put this creature in a place, a town, a building, a neighborhood, and have it start messing with things. I try to think of what the worst possible outcome of this monster could be. I'm a fan of apocalyptic threats. So for our demon-wolves, they are out to devour souls so that more of their kind can inhabit the bodies of their victims. So, worst case scenario, earth becomes a huge hunting ground under the dominion of the Demon Lord of the Hunt.<br/><br/>At this point is usually when I have a Concept that has some flesh to it. There's a monster in a place and there are people at risk. For extras and other folks, I prepare a list of 25 or 30 names from the <a href="http://www.atlantagamer.org/iGM/RandomNames/index.php" rel="nofollow">Ultimate Random Name Generator</a> in my notes and choose names, as needed. <br/><br/>So, the Countdown begins with the first thing that catches the PCs eyes. Our PCs are professional monster hunters, more or less, so this could be the rumors of something weird in a "haunted" location or a call from an agency or other ally about a missing person. Now, figure out what your monster needs to do from it's starting point to achieve the awful goal you dreamed up for it. Does the monster need a major power source, or a specific magic item, or just to kill enough victims. <br/><br/>Start filling in goals or milestones for your Monster. For our Were-Demons, I think murder and possession sound dark and grim enough for my group. Once the first one is summoned (now there's a huge piece of plot to chew on), he needs to murder 11 more people so demons of the hunt can possess them. Then the were-demons can summon their demonic overlord. The countdown is not 11 points long, so we should ratchet up the speed of the threat. Most groups will throw these plans off course very early, so don't worry about moving too fast. Here's one way to do it.<br/><br/>1. Day \u2013 Draco Hendricks, a famous occultist with a dark reputation is anonymously reported and found dismembered in his underground ritual chamber. Draco's acolytes, a couple dozen, have disappeared.<br/>2. Shadows \u2013 The following night, Draco Hendricks rises from death as a Were-Demon. A violent incident at the morgue and his missing corpse are reported in the news that night. <br/>3. Dusk \u2013 He finds the first of his missing acolytes and converts him.<br/>4. Sunset \u2013 By Daybreak, 10 acolytes have been hunted down and converted.<br/>5. Nightfall \u2013 The last acolyte, possibly a relative or love interest of one of the PCs, has been slain.  <br/>6. Midnight \u2013 The ritual is performed in Draco's ritual room. Malpheziax, the Demon Lord of the Hunt establishes dominion over the earth.<br/><br/>Those were created in roughly the following order: 6, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4<br/><br/>Now I have enough info to detail the Monster:<br/><br/><b>Were-Demons, evil spirits of the hunt</b><br/>a devourer, bent on consuming enough souls to summon the Demon Lord<br/>10 hit points, 1 armor, can only be harmed by blessed or holy weapons<br/>Powers: Vile Warlockery, Wolf Senses<br/>Attacks: Claws or Bite 3, close, messy; Life Drain 2, near, loud (howl)<br/>Weaknesses: Any symbol of purity will repel a Were-Demon. Holy or blessed items can kill them, though they still get armor generally.<br/>Moves: pounce from the shadows, slip away, locate prey<br/><br/>Moves are the kinds of things your Monster MUST do to create the kind of threat and mood you need for your game to satisfy YOU the Keeper of Mysteries. So if you want a vampire who is dashing and going to sweep a character or npc off their feet, give him the move Romantic Embrace. Does he turn to mist? That sounds more like a power. But "Make a Magical Getaway" is a move. Also, make sure to note any descriptions or other details about the monster as they come to you. Don't be afraid to leave some blanks for inspirations or cool player ideas during the game.<br/><br/>If any obvious NPCs come to mind, give them names and motives. Also, think about what sort of infrastructure a monster might need. Does it need it's magic or electric energy restored? Is it pampered by starry-eyed cultists? Is it inhabiting the body of someone wealthy or powerful? These sorts of questions can give you ideas about important NPCs or Minions. For our Were-Demons, we know we have a bunch of cultists. We could just randomize that number of names and at least have some details handy. Perhaps any of them, if saved, could help the PCs understand the threat. There's probably Draco's spouse, his manager, a police detective in charge of the case, a coroner, a gazillion fans, stalkers, and of course, someone to bless their weapons if they aren't already. You can't populate the entire world. Dream up as much as you can, but don't be afraid to incorporate the crazy theories of your players.<br/><br/>Finally, we need a hook, something to get the PCs involved. The fame of our "first victim" is a big hook. BUt it's also possible that a professional or initiate could learn of the violence from their organization ahead of the media. Do whichever is going to make for the most cinematic scene sets up the character for coolness.<br/><br/>That's the bones of what I've gleaned.

The worm looks like a gigantic pulsating intestine, with a hagfish face. It can spew streams (picture a fire hose) of acidic bile and desires the corruption of the pure.<br/><br/>The only thing that can stop her? To spill bile from the liver of an innocent within the circle, and thus ruining the ritual, before the solar eclipse.

I'd get every player with a beginning-of-session move to roll it, and anyone else who wanted to pursue an avenue of investigation would roll it.<br/><br/>- I'd make sure what a hunter is attempting to do via the Investigate a Mystery move could plausibly deliver the results they're after.<br/><br/>- I'd pay super-close attention to the distinction between the Use Magic move and the Big Magic move. Many games of Monster of the Week can spiral a little out-of-control if players use the Use Magic move to basically become superheroes. My preference, now, is to be very hard on the limitations of Use Magic and very liberal with what Big Magic can do - but to clearly establish that Big Magic takes much longer. If a particular Big Magic spell is used more than once, it can get transferred into a Use Magic move over time (the use of exorcisms by the Winchester Brothers in <i>Supernatural</i> is a good example of this).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
