It seems like comedy of manners would tend to sink into the fiction; whereas, even a subtle pun would tend to pop out of the fiction. But then, maybe both could be used to weave the real and fictional contexts in and out of each other.</blockquote>I think Jarod's nicely nailed some of the consequences of different approaches, and I couldn't agree more that sophisticated use of e.g. those two could produce something really rewarding. <br/><br/>Taking your wider point, about different types of comedy, I wonder if we tend to rely a lot on one basic technique: be mindful of tone. Do be wacky, keep it understated, that kind of thing. Actually, I think in of itself that can do a lot - people can be smart and sensitive and manage this stuff by directing their attention towards it. However, I think that more support can be given, and I'm wondering how to get it.<br/><br/>Firstly, does it already exist in the rpg community?, I'd be curious to how some of the big funny-oriented games like Toon, Paranoia, Ghostbusters, etc approach things. Do they gather up active advice for how to introduce and run with funny content? Are there suggestions for how to sustain different comedic moods?<br/><br/>Secondly, what forms could support take? Personally, my mind is on attention-directing stuff. Things on the character sheet, advice for the GM in the form of "when this sort of thing happens, consider this". Not so much around concrete mechanics. Is there scope for other stuff?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194882/#Comment_194882" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T11:56:27+00:00" title="February 28, 2009 11:56AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Examples to give some meat to this:<br/><br/>When two people meet, consider how one could form an arbitrary reaction to another - want an autograph, be disgusted by their order.

Differences in status can be funny.  Differences in objective power can be funny.  Forcing players to subvert their character's own power and status is always funny.  Heightening and reincorporation can be funny, so why not require them?  I think putting in procedural cues is enough - you don't need to call out the humor at all.  In fact, doing so will probably kill it.  <i>Paranoia </i>is a good example of each of these points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194997/#Comment_194997" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T06:04:43+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  6:04AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2009 6:06AM by GB_Steve.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dying Earth is a comedic game.

(It sounds like Dying Earth gets a lot of mileage from the same thing.)  Rather than being a frustrating side effect of low level, it is central to play that the skills a Troubleshooter would nominally require to complete his mission have nothing whatsoever to do with the skills required to be chosen as a Troubleshooter.  You are good at toadying and betrayal, at turning in your friends for fun and profit; you <i>need</i> to be good at shooting trouble with a laser.  Your negative skills drive the story forward, such that if you don't have a high Laser Pistol skill, that counts as a flag to the GM that you want to fail in firearms combat.  And so failure, really abject rolling-around-in-the-vatslime failure, smoking boots failure, laser holes in torsos failure, circular betrayal debriefing failure, bot treadmarks on the forehead failure, total-party-kill failure, is assured and awesome.  This is true even if you elect to play it 100% straight: you get that double-fine, pitch-black <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>-type humor from the mismatch of organizational goals and the traits that the organization selects for.<br/><br/>This ports well to non-comedy games.  I've run <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> straight every time, more than a hundred times.  No saying "cyclopean" and smirking, no genre-savvy characters (as in <i>Scream</i>), no cross-genre exports ("Scream for Jeeves"), no postmodern nothin' allowed.  And yet, we've had our share of laughs at the expense of characters who are the only people in the world who know what's wrong, since they read the book, but then... how do an academic librarian, an antiquarian, and a mathematics professor stop a doomsday cult again?  <br/><br/>MP: "I know \u2014 I'll prove theorems at them!"<br/>AL: "And I'll catalog their cards!"<br/><br/>When the characters say it, it's out of frustration and horror.  The audience is allowed to laugh.<br/><br/>As an adversity-slinging GM, you can take a more general technique away from this.  Consider what your party isn't good at, in light of how they aspire to see their characters change.  The situation is that they need to use the skills (or equipment or whatever) they wish they had; their reward is a chance, maybe, to get those things.  In between, there is comedy that doesn't take excursions from the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195127/#Comment_195127" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T15:00:55+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  3:00PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to talk about this.
