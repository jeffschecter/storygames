I have to say, I love the form factor of the ashcan. I recall our email conversation prior to Gen Con; you printed and bound the books yourself? You actually own a corner rounding machine?!?<br/>2. I also love your art style. Is the dude on the cover wearing an Ashcan Front shirt!<br/>3. The way you have a parent Table of Contents, and then separate Tables of Contents for the various sections is...uncommon. I have to say it took me a bit to figure out that topics like "Health" and "Confidence," which don't appear in the Table of Contents for their section, but have the same font and font size as all of your page headers, are actually conceptually subordinate to "Essential Skills," which does appear in the Table of Contents. (And this was important, because you reference "essential skills" throughout the mechanics and it's only through understanding the structure of the Table of Contents that I was able to figure out what the essential skills are.) I rather like the nested structure of Tables of Contents, but perhaps a little font or style differentiation of the page headers might be in order. Did you create the nested Tables of Contents structure manually? Or via some feature of your page layout softare?<br/>4. Okay, so I love the form factor, and I love your art style, but damn, more than those things do I love the May Court concept. If it's not totally unique in FRPGs it's certainly uncommon for the play group to be the whole of an organization, not lackeys or field agents but the meaningful agents that define the organism.<br/>5. I'm conflicted about your "What is the May Court?" section. On one hand, it rewards from re-reading and asking yourself how it makes sense, and this is rare for an RPG. But on the other hand it's so inclusive of options (intentional vs. naturally formed courts, travelling or not, membership is mandatory, or optional, or only for young adults, or inclusive of older adults, titles that reflect who an individual is, or what they're struggling with, or what they might be later in life) that the concept does rather shift around and defy being as powerfully inspiring of play than it might. I think what you need is either a structure for narrowing the options, or inspiring examples and artwork, because broad inclusiveness actually works against the confidence of someone who's considering running the game. You need to help that person achieve forward momentum.<br/>6. I want to know what "ceremonies" are. I want to know what an "anointed member" of a May Court is.<br/>7. For some reason I had a powerful expectation of seeing this sentence at the end of all of the broad inclusiveness of the "What is the May Court?" section: "In playing the game you will find that all of this is true." If you can help the prospective gamemaster achieve forward momentum through all the options and then deliver on that sentence I was expecting, it will be an amazing game.<br/>8. There are definitely some contradictions in the text. At one point you write that a person's title is "often a reflection of who they are" and then you contradict it later by writing that the title is "not their essence."<br/>9. The positions in the May Court are hands down the game's most inspiring stuff. As I say above, I love the May Court concept, and a big part of that is the positions. They're awesome. I want tarot-esque symbolic illustrations of the positions.<br/>10. Part of what makes the positions so great is that the reader can't help but map them onto people he knows. The way the May Court makes sense to me is that it's a creative community. And so the positions get mapped onto the indie game design community. Jared is the Fool. Vincent is the Priest. Other positions are less obvious. I suspect any designer with an ego first maps himself to the May King. It wasn't until Danielle told me I'm the Courtier, and I realized she was right, that I came to a deeper understanding of the iconic vs. misguided conflicts embedded in the positions and everything fell into place. Ron is the Advocate. Ben Lehman and Troy Costisick are Sorcerers.<br/>11. Are the questions in the middle of page 40 part of chargen, or are they just rhetorical?<br/>12. The first two questions on page 41 suggest it's possible to have a character without a title. Is that true? If so, is it functional? And if so, who chooses? The creator of the character? Or the other players?<br/>13. On page 45 you write that traits "flesh out the details of the efforts." I was confused how traits were conceptually different than motivations and skills, but that explanation, contrasting skills=whether, motivations=why, and traits=details nailed it for me.<br/>14. On page 46 you write that traits can include "narrative elements." What do you mean by that?<br/>15. On page 47 you write that traits with more than 1 rank should be generated before play. What's your design goal behind that? Referencing the rank chart on the same page, not being able to define traits of rank 2 or higher in play seems to be telling me that I'm not allowed to define things that put diversity and variety into my character during play, only things that hew close to the core of the character concept. Is that what you want?<br/>16. Injuries affect skills, and can lock you out of a mode of conflict. I like it.<br/>17. On page 55 you write that if "a character suffers enough injuries to Health that they are removed from conflict, they may be physically incapable of action, have passed out, or may be dead." I believe I understand how injury tests determine if a character can no longer perform in a specific mode of conflict, but how do we know whether the character is just incapable of action, or is dead? (I have thoughts on how I might rule on this, but I'm curious how you intend it to work.)</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116996/#Comment_116996" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T10:48:24+00:00" title="December 29, 2007 10:48AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<ul>18. Love confidence as a stat.<br/>19. On page 64, what do you mean by characters attempting to "challenge the results of a conflict"? Do you mean a character trying again to win an argument mode conflict that the character had previously lost? And if so, does trying again only apply to argument mode conflicts? I confess, my worry is that this "trying again" will be about as dramatic as searching a large room for secret doors, or multiple attempts to pick a lock in old school AD&amp;D. But I could be wrong.<br/>20. Page 65 is your scale of success ranks. I think you have too many success ranks. It's simply not possible to make fine-line distinctions in play between things like "amazing," "masterful," and "exceptional" outcomes. I recommend collapsing the list so that more than one numeric value maps to the same SR description. A hierarchy of Amateur, Competent, Masterful, Transcendent seems complex enough, and pretty intuitive.<br/>21. I like the "receptive success" concept. Seems like it has a lot of potential for making conflict outcomes interesting.<br/>22. On page 67 you write that "even if a character fails the check, the action may succeed," but with negative consequences. How is it determined whether an action succeeds or not after a failed check?<br/>23. You use the phrase "mode of conflict" quite a bit. I believe you mean that each "essential skill" (health, confidence, argument) that you can take damage against represents a "mode of conflict," but it took me a long time to figure that out, and so it should probably be more clear in the text.<br/>24. On pages 64, 65, and 72 you use the term "circumstances." Because it says on page 64 that "negative...circumstances" give penalty dice, you can't be meaning "circumstances" to be synonymous with "obstacles" (which, according to page 68, establish the minimum SR). So...what are "circumstances"?<br/>25. And I confess to a bit of concern about how many ways the GM has to fiddle with the odds of a character's success: circumstances that give penalty dice, obstacles that set the target SR number, complexity of obstacles that requires multiple rolls, and obstacles (as described on page 68) that have "quality of success" requirements. My experience with systems that give a GM lots of ways to fiddle with the odds of a character's success is that they enable GM railroading by empowering the GM to hide how he's skewing for the outcomes he wants. I think you should strip some of these out.<br/>26. I don't see anything mechanically relevant about the character's "key conflict" as described on page 43 or the "words of fate" described on page 44. Am I missing something? What do these things do?<br/>27. I like your vision from pages 70-71 for the game's dice paradigm, that the dice determine which path the world is encouraging, and that if the dice produce a high SR for a strange character action, that it's then an interpretive challenge to make the action relevant.<br/>28. When does community creation happen? It's so fundamental that you can't possibly intend for it to happen during play? I think the unreflective designer might put it prior to chargen. But I think it should happen after. The group should have to look at the created characters and create a community concept that represents a hopeful or meaningful social artistic context for the characters collectively. You create your characters independently, and then those characters are a creative constraint on the collective creation of the May Court concept.<br/>29. I'm also thinking it might be productive if the positions in the court were determined last, after the May Court concept is established, rather than as the first step of chargen. But I'm not as strong about this as I am about creating the community concept after chargen.<br/>30. Do you envision a game session of round-robin scenes? Or all characters working together in scenes together? Do you envision much inter-player conflict? Inter-player conflict as the primary mover of the narrative?<br/>30b. My experience is that most narrativist indie games work best with three or four players. I have a suspicion that The Path of Journeys may ultimately end up being a game that plays great with twice that many players. I can see the game playing out like a dinner party, or a parlor larp, with the GM chipping in antagonism (the world's ignorance and apathy, and society's skepticism), and the forward momentum being driven by players inhabiting their position roles.<br/>31. I love the "challenges" and "enigmatic statements." They're like quests. Creating good challenges and enigmatic statements will be an art the GM will have to develop; some advice to the prospective GM on how to do so is definitely in order. How, for instance, do you challenge an Advocate?<br/>32. On page 49 you write that as characters develop, "they become living paragons of their motivations." This is very much in the same space as what I've been aiming at with The Niche Engine. I've been describing it as "the transition from Robin of Loxley to Robin Hood, from human to an iconic entity uniquely empowered to change the course of societal events." So maybe that explains some of my enthusiasm for The Path of Journeys (and when I get The Niche Engine to ashcan stage you should probably expect me to want a Path of Journeys ad for the back).<br/>33. On page 83 you suggest having the Advocacy session at the beginning of play. Ron has playtested the game, right? Did they have their Advocacy at the beginning of the session? Did it work? My inclination prior to reading your advice was to have it at the end of the session.<br/>33b. I think you need to solid up what you want Advocacy to be. Is it just players recapping and justifying in response to questions, informing the Advocate player about what has transpired. Or is it the Advocate player judging and slinging doubt?</ul>\nAnd that's all I got. It has been a few months since Gen Con, so I'm definitely interested in hearing some of the other feedback you've been receiving. And in your intro you suggest that designing the game is partly an exploration of your own role in a May Court as a May King. If I might ask, what does your Advocate have to say about the game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doplegager" title="doplegager"><img alt="doplegager" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doplegager">doplegager</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117237/#Comment_117237" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-31T13:32:38+00:00" title="December 31, 2007  1:32PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul!  Thanks for the feedback- that's quite a list!  I've actually been actively tooling with Path of Journeys lately, but I need to get a few more ducks in a row before I really say much.  But still, it's on my mind- so it's really cool to get input right now.  I'm having to chop the list into bite-sized chunks, so it'll take a little while before I've responded to them all.\n<ul>\n<li>1. Heh.  I first got the corner rounder when I was self-publishing Weekend Comics, vol 2.  I had scrounged together a card game called "Artists Gone Wild", where some character cards were based off of local artists.  I was mostly distributing my zine through art events, so it gave me an extra hook in terms of making strong connections.<br/><br/>I'm also a bit of a production nerd.  My printer cost me more than some of the used cars at the car lot down the block.  I've given discount printing to most of the active local zinesters and currently do the printing for the local pagan newsletter (which I need to get printed today...).<br/></li>\n<li>2. You caught me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/></li>\n<li>3. Hmm.  Good points.  The table of contents was put together manually, so I don't have much of an excuse.  I'm looking through a copy right now and see how it can be confusing.  Should be easy enough to get working on the next draft.<br/></li>\n<li>4-7.  Yeah- the May Court has been getting positive feedback.  At the time, the section on the May Court was pulling triple duty.  On one hand, it was the beginning of a setting for the game.  One another hand, it was my exploration of concepts I'd been dealing with since last May.  On the third hand, it was also being written as a kind of thesis to give to my community elders and/or next year's May Court*.  A lot of the ambiguities was came from it being an exploration and as a result of doing some political dancing.  Next draft gets to be much more about being a game.  I think it'll still be important to dance around ambiguity, but at least I'll only be doing one dance instead of two or three.<br/><br/>(*The idea of having more titles than just the May King and May Queen has actually had quite a bit of controversy locally; local elders finally had "Paige" and "Handmaiden" positions last year as a kind of jr. May King and Queen.)<br/></li>\n<li>8.  Hmm.  The original thought was that titles were like portraits; they can capture parts of the character, but it's important to remember that they aren't the entirety of the character.  That'll be something to clarify in the next draft.  Hopefully some of the other contradictions will clear up too.<br/></li>\n<li>9-10. Hee hee.  It's kind of like one of those internet memes, but with 50% less spam.  The titles in this draft were largely derived from cross-referencing i ching trigrams and tarot cards.  I figured if one set of symbols didn't feel timeless and iconic, the other would.  Official titles aside, I tend to think of myself as an Advocate who wants to be a Sorcerer.  A lot of my creative work ends up either challenging or satirizing, but I tend to speak very lightly.<br/><br/>The original plan was to have illustrations for each position in the hopes of using the book to double as a kind of illustration portfolio.  The images were one of the last things I had to scrap to save time- the decision was made late enough in the design that the pages where they would have been are blank.  It's probably a good thing, as I don't think I was really in a space to market myself aggressively last summer.<br/></li>\n<li>11. At the time I was writing, I was thinking of them more as rhetorical.  I didn't really give them any mechanical reinforcement.<br/></li>\n<li>12. Hmm.  The original intent was that a character definitely had a title, the only question was if it was officially recognized.  This was a side effect of political dancing for locals; last year's Paige is going to qualify for the May King position this year, but has been trying to petition for a kind of knighthood instead.  It was kind of a nod to him without directly slapping any elders in the face ('your real title is earned through action, not because its bestowed ceremonially").</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doplegager" title="doplegager"><img alt="doplegager" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doplegager">doplegager</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117542/#Comment_117542" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-02T16:09:38+00:00" title="January  2, 2008  4:09PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2008 4:29PM by doplegager.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All right.  New Years day festivities are drawing to an end, so back to being a good designer and responding to feedback!\n<ul>\n<li>13. Yeah- the relationship between skills, motivations, and traits is pretty important.  I'll try to establish that more directly and earlier in future drafts.  I'm thinking that I'm going to make a list of "important concepts" in addition to a "need to clarify" list.<br/></li><li>14. The original intent was to open up the Traits category to include things like past experiences.  It was directly inspired by Dogs in the Vineyard, but I don't think it felt fully integrated into this draft.<br/></li><li>15. I've been struggling with traits.  In the Ashcan draft, they were the only numeric aspect of the character where higher meant better.  Because you added the value of the Trait directly the Success Rate, they were incredibly powerful.  The original concern was that Traits with values of 2 or 3 should only be things that were important to the core of the character- with an underlying assumption that the core of the character was developed prior to play.  I've been seriously rethinking this issue- both in terms of mechanical impact, as well as the underlying assumption.  I've grown rather fond of organic, in-game character development and don't want to inhibit it.<br/></li><li>16. A part of the goal was a mechanical explanation for the character who gets into a fistfight and ends up saying "ok... we can be civil about this..." after being beaten down. <br/></li><li>17. Hmm.  My original thought was to use drama to determine the degree to which a character was incapacitated, but it feels like a hole in the mechanics that I've never really resolved.  I've played with using a few variants, but haven't been very satisfied.  I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts!<br/></li><li>19. Hmm.  I couldn't find the quote on page 64, but there's a very similar reference on page 57.  The original intent was to limit the number of times a character could make an argument even if a character healed their Argument essential skill between attempts; "Fred's saying we should go in the dungeon again... but he's been saying that all day".  There are probably ways to make it more elegant.  The design goal wasn't to encourage repetitive efforts- it was to limit them by restricting a loophole.<br/></li><li>20. Totally agree.  The current scale is a bit cumbersome without any benefit other than stretching the limits of the thesarus.<br/></li><li>21-22. That's what happens when I read Burning Wheel while listening to an audio book of the Tao Te Ching.  It seems fairly raw at the moment.  The philosophy is there, but it's stumbling in the mechanics.  I'm looking forward to fleshing it a bit more in the next draft.  Several interesting things have been culminating the past few days.  The first is I've always thought of Path of Journeys as being influenced by Everway.  The second is I've been sitting on an i ching-inspired card game where any given card can be played either Yin or Yang (the card is placed regularly or reversed); each player has three cards in front of them to form a trigram, and a card's special ability is activated if either of its trigrams are in play. <br/><br/>The image that went through my head a couple of nights ago would be to make a set of cards based on the 64 hexagrams with major-arcana style images.  In my mental image, the GM laid out a trigram to get a feel for the scene.  Every time a player tried an action that resulted in a roll, one of the three cards was replaced with another card.  If the trigram was more Yang than Yin, it would be an active success or failure.  If the trigram was more Yin than Yang, it would be a passive success or failure.  The mental image went further (if the three cards set down at the beginning were all Yin, it would be a cutscene; a combination of Yin and Yang, the GM would set the scene; all Yang, the players could choose the scene).  Whether this would be cumbersome or interesting... I don't know.  But I'm hoping to give it a shot with some playtesting.<br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doplegager" title="doplegager"><img alt="doplegager" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doplegager">doplegager</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117831/#Comment_117831" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T18:41:22+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  6:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time for another set of responses!  <ul>\n<li>23.  Check.  On the "clarify" list.<br/></li><li>24-25. Hmm.  In my mind, as I was designing, Circumstances and Traits were mechanically the same thing.  The original intent was that an obstacle described the big thing the player was trying to overcome and circumstances were used to pick up the details; the difference between the ranger tracking orcs and the ranger tracking orcs during a monsoon.  The distinction between the two made sense at the time, but feels a little arbitrary in retrospect.  I'll play around with simplifying the process.<br/></li><li>26. The original intent was that the key conflicts and the words of fate are supposed to give springboards for situations.  In different versions of the draft, the key conflicts and words of fate were used to drive character advancement ("Challenges", page 80), but the connection somehow got lost in the Ashcan.  In another version, introducing the key conflicts and/or words of fate into a scene was supposed to indicate that things were about to reach a high point- kind of like a reverse of Ryan Stoughton's Death Flag hack for d20; in this case, the words of fate were a kind of prophecy.  Introducing them into a scene meant that anything could happen afterwards.<br/></li><li>27. Yeah.  I've had some players criticize how much I let dice influence my decisions while I game master, but I've always tried to think of the random resolution mechanics as collaborators in the process; dice as divination instead of dice as random number generator.<br/></li><li>28-29.  I think that community creation is the white elephant in the bedroom of character creation.  It's hard to avoid defining the community as you're defining the characters.  The process that I have in my mind would be: establish setting, create characters, define community- but it's also easy to see community as being intrinsic in setting depending on how literally the May Court is interpreted.  This is probably one of those issues where I'll end up going back and forth on for awhile.<br/></li><li>30. Hmm.  Prior to GenCon, I hadn't really had an opportunity to see any round-robin games in action, so I had a pretty strong image of all the characters primarily working together as a group with inter-party conflict either being secondary to the drive of the game or building up to party cooperation.  But, I was also trying to idealize communities as being largely unified.  If that assumption is removed, I can see potential for inter-party conflict.  Ron's playtest had a similar idea, where different characters came from different sides of a war, with the group's 'community' being something that developed in response to their actions.<br/></li><li>32.  I look forward to hearing more about it!<br/></li><li>33-34. Heh.  That's one of the details I've been trying to get from him.  I've had a few e-mail exchanges with Ron, but he was pretty busy at the time and my own schedule kept me from harassing him too much.  I need to start bugging him again now that we're between semesters.  The source of the Advocate session was drawn from Jarrod A, who started every session by having the player's recap the events of the last session, partly so everyone would be reminded and partly so he could get a better idea of what the player's thought was important.  It seemed like such a strong tool, but I've never seen it explicitly used in rules.  The ability to go back and add details or potentially change details seemed like a natural development.  I think Ron ran the Advocate as a historian who was trying to piece things together hundreds of years after the story.<br/>As an aside, one of my assumptions was that the Advocate that's questioning the group would be the GM and would be completely separate from anybody in the group playing an advocate.  From the feedback I've received so far, I think I'm the only one who interpreted it that way :-p<br/></li></ul>\nOne of the biggest pieces of feedback I've had was from Ben Lehman.  He talked a little bit about how harsh the dice mechanic was and how the traits seemed disproportionately valuable; even if you only rolled 1 die, you could still get an SR of 1.  If you had a +2 trait, you could be completely incompetent and on the brink of death... and the lowest SR you could get would be a 3.  In the latest draft, I've been retooling the dice mechanics to work more like this for a standard character: roll the dice pool and add the three lowest die results.  If you roll less than three dice, treat each unrolled die as having a result of 7.  Negative traits/circumstances add dice, positive traits/circumstances remove the lowest die rolled.  Standard characters have a weighted curve of results between 3 and 21.  The spirit of an inverted dice pool is still strong but the mechanics feel more playable.<br/><br/>I've had a few amusing responses so far from locals.  My descriptions of the May King and May Queen positions were gender inclusive; "...the misguided May King may... try to dismiss the finite nature of his or her creations" and "A misguided May Queen may... be too distant from the people he or she tries to support."  Most of the local pagans who have read the book have read the section on the May King and not noticed the gender inclusivity until they read the section on the May Queen.  Various things in the book have made people notice small assumptions.  If anything, I've felt like <i>I've</i> been an Advocate.  A very soft spoken, passive Advocate, but an Advocate all the same.  That said, there are a couple of issues that I'm going to need to stop being so soft spoken and passive about.  If this goes the way it seems like it is, I'm going to be playing the role of the young adult who challenges disparity between what the elders say and what the elders do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117988/#Comment_117988" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T13:02:34+00:00" title="January  4, 2008  1:02PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an inkling at what you're hinting at Ram; my response is a solid, "here here."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
