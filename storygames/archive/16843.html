Compared to my pre-internet FLGS games, I'd say attendence is actually about the same.  The key to my success it two fold.

People have lots of gaming options and, well, they go where the action is. Or they help out their grandma. Or they have a hot date. Part of the roleplaying ethos is the implicit understanding that there are probably better things you could be doing with your time. I have no plans to do them, but sometimes you just can't get free.<br/><br/>Also, we're not as socially-invested as other groups. Simple courtesies, like warning people that you might not show up to a game, aren't as ingrained in our subculture. For one thing, we don't get as strong a reward from the results of those courtesies as others who attend to them. For another, many roleplayers have gained the benefits of alienation (we have more than our fair share of geniuses and eccentrics) and they aren't as intimidated by the implied social threat of rudeness as others.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384254/#Comment_384254" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T16:09:25+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  4:09PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'll change over time.

What I'm seeing with my son's generation (post high school) is a lot of pick up games with very little pre-planning since they're all going to school or doing jobs at differenent hours.  Small board and dice games are making a strong showing.  WH40K which was once their passion, has almost completely dropped off the radar.  [Shame, I loved making terrain for their games.]  On the bright side, they are very open to rules lite one-shot games and they are my go-to guys for playtesting.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384362/#Comment_384362" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-05T12:24:46+00:00" title="July  5, 2012 12:24PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a long standing FTF game on Thursdays and a long standing On-Line game on Wednesdays. I find that attendance to both are equally abused. And I find that recruiting for either is equally as painful.<br/>I used to worry about on-line gaming with a lot of the same concerns. But I think that the stereotypes around on-line gaming just make us notice the crappiness that is recruiting and scheduling players to show up for a game more.<br/>I mean, think back to the last time you organized a FTF game and think about how many times someone you knew who acted interested in your RPG game night flaked out the moment you actually asked them to attend. Or how some people can only make it to your FTF game about 50% of the time and the trials and tribulations about whether to keep them or drop them, etc.<br/>It is just the same as Online gaming, but confirmation bias just makes you notice it more. Or we have just become conditioned to the pain that is FTF game scheduling, lol<br/>Dave M<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384379/#Comment_384379" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-05T17:16:04+00:00" title="July  5, 2012  5:16PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The beauty of the Ars Magica troupe style was that we never needed full attendance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
