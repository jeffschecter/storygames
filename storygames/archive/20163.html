Wil does a good job setting the mood and I was thinking that this would turn me from "Why does this game even exist, it puts dex elements into my beloved RPG hobby, I can't deal" to "This game is genius, it nees to be played (just not by me)".<br/><br/>Spoilers in the discussion from now on, so go see it.<br/><br/>But wouldn't it be more awesome if there were some real <i>choices</i> associated with pulling? Every time they pulled, Wil just gave them a bad consequence. Come on! They've decided on pulling, they made the pull, now something <i>good</i> should happen otherwise there's no reason to ever pull. I guess stake setting before would help.<br/>He asked for pulls for every little thing; like "We pack our bags" Pull! "We turn on the radio" Pull!<br/>And the rewards for the pulls weren't there.<br/>"You have to pull to dress this guys wounds" Ok, made it. "Yeah he falls unconscious with a busted artery."<br/>"You have to pull to even hear what he's saying" Ok, made it. "Yeah, he says gargle gargle leave now and after one more successful pull, he says full moon".<br/><br/>Why even ever pull?<br/>I read an AP a few years ago where it was like "Ok: No pull, this happens. Failed pull, that happens. Successful pull, the other happens." and the player gritted their teeth and said "I pull".<br/>The outcomes need to be Failed pull &lt; No pull &lt; Successful pull but on this show, it just seemed that there was a lot of gratuitous pulls. It felt like No pull == Successful pull.<br/>Which might make sense given the condensed time they had, but I'd rather they solved that with more priming.<br/><br/>I've followed this show from the beginning and I'm not trying to knock Wil, it's good and I like this episode still.<br/>We don't nitpick just to nitpick. It's because there's a concern that "People will learn it wrong because of this show". Which\u2026 I guess wouldn't necessarily be the worst thing in the world if they did.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445124/#Comment_445124" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-07T21:43:26+00:00" title="May  7, 2015  9:43PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good points.<br/>My question would be... are they somehow expressed in the rulebook?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445125/#Comment_445125" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-07T22:19:58+00:00" title="May  7, 2015 10:19PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I understand it, and play it, is simply that you pull when you want to avoid something happening - and this is often prompted by the GM when you declare action, with the implication that you ain't gonna get what you want if you don't pull. If you're cool with the way things are going, or want to risk it, you just refuse the pull and let the GM do their thing. Pulls are content authority, as a successful pull constrains the GM from doing whatever they would if you didn't pull. (This is probably obvious, but just like any stakes-setting game: if you take the pull and the GM still fucks you up, they're cheating. Pulls have power, or they mean nothing.)<br/><br/>The beautiful part here is this: the creative agenda in Dread is for the GM to scare you pants off with this excellent story they've prepared. This is beautiful when it comes to the passive-aggressive resolution mechanic because the GM's creative motivation means that you, the player, really do have a modicum of choice in negotiating about pulls. I mean, the GM tries some bullshit about pulling to <i>pack your bags</i>? You just don't do it, that's a subjective right - you never need to pull! What's he gonna do? Like, will a monster jump out of the closet and eat you because you didn't pack your bags? Great story, GM! More likely they'll just smile and nod, and you discover that they were just calibrating expectations with you, seeing if you want to pull. (Remember, as a player you often want to pull to make the tower shakier and thus more deadly, because you're in there to hurry things up as well as immerse in your character. You don't want to touch the tower when it's shaky, but you don't mind an unnecessary "soft" pull when there's no risk to it.)<br/><br/>Just in case it's not obvious from the text - been a while since I read it - the way you handle a character who should die and be removed from the story, when the player refuses to pull: have the character go temporarily insane or go into an injurious coma or something, and amuse yourself by describing how much it hurts or how horrible their hallucinations are or whatever. Keep doing that in between real scenes you run for the other characters. Make it clear to the player that they need a pull to get out of the horrible head-space the character is in, and back into the game. The player <i>can</i> wait for somebody else to bite it to take a safe pull after the rebuild, or they can bite the bullet and risk perishing when they fail the pull. You are not allowed to unilaterally remove a character from the story if the player refuses to pull, but you are allowed to make them wish they were dead. What this amounts to in practice is that you can insist on a pull as a GM, but only if you're willing to throw the entire weight of the story on it: you pull, or your character might as well not be in this story anymore.<br/><br/>The GM may choose to demand a pull if you want to accomplish something, but their motivation in doing this is not to make you pull just because (well, sometimes for pacing reasons it is, but that's the GM's problem and absolutely the part that actually makes the game worth playing instead of replacing it with freeform), and you can hold them onto it by daring them to do their worst. Much of the time it's totally obvious that the GM is just trying to get you to pull for no reason, while other times you know it in your bones that this will totally be the moment when, if you don't pull to climb <i>quickly</i>, an awful thing will happen to you. That's when you pull, even if the tower is shaky.<br/><br/>Note that all this doesn't have anything to do with stakes-setting, the GM doesn't establish the consequences of shying away, pulling or tumbling in advance; of course people can play the way they want, but I personally would not want to foil this pretty and unique scheme just to bolt in a standard stakes-setting generic conflict resolution mechanic. Without explicit stakes, there is uncertainty and fear and psychological power play and artistic statement: you call the GM's bluff, and see what will happen now that you shied away from the pull. He was just trying to make you kill yourself, anyway. Turn that into a cut-and-dried storyboarding stakes thing, and the entire affair where you try to get some other player to have the last pull becomes the GM's game - they just need to establish stakes that you <i>have</i> to call, and that's all she wrote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445126/#Comment_445126" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-07T22:51:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2015 10:51PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2015 10:56PM by Hasimir.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got around to watching the whole vid and... I don't see the things you critique in there o_O<br/><br/>For example, the wounded guy.<br/>He is bleeding out and Ivan wants to stabilize him.<br/>Being just a student with no medical training he has to pull, succeeds, and Will describes how he manages to somehow do exactly as he wanted even though the wound was worse than expected.<br/><br/>Then the characters are in a forest chased by monsters and Laura tries to ascertain if the noises she hears indicate that the menace is closing on them or getting away.<br/>It's a dangerous situation with pressure from a lot of sources so she has to pull... she succeeds... and Will tells her how YES, the monster is near and is actually looking directly at her.<br/><br/>Another guy is in some kind of coma or something, and is babbling something, and Ivan wants to understand what he's saying... Will tells him that, depending on how much he wants to learn he can pull or not... Ivan pulls and succeeds and as a result Will roleplays a bit of gibberish and then adds "<i>and then his eyes snap open and he says WE HAVE TO LEAVE!</i>".<br/><br/>So they are on the run, they have to leave the location in a hurry, but they are still trying to pack their stuff and dismount the camp without leaving things behind.<br/>Molly is in charge of that and when Will asks how her character feels she describes panic and desperation... so he asks her to pull in order to maintain her composure (I assume, to avoid leaving important stuff behind or doing a half assed job that might hinder their escape).<br/><br/>Same to build a thing to drag a wounded guy with them while they are running for the raft.<br/>Or to speed up their escape even though they are carrying the whole camp stuff and a wounded guy while creatures start howling all around them.<br/><br/>So... I don't know... it all looks pretty good to me.<br/>Sometimes Will seems to be describing a bit too much how the characters feel, but he doesn't push it, or it bases it on questions made to the players.<br/><br/>Every pull was asked when the Players wanted their PCs to achieve something useful that was also either particularly difficult and/or under pressure and duress.<br/>Every success delivered, likewise, useful results or info.<br/>The bleeding guy got stabilized.<br/>The coma guy told clearly the important bit of his message.<br/>The threat was assessed unambiguously.<br/>The camp got packed before other problems befell the group and without leaving important stuff behind.<br/>The escape was made faster and with no bad encounters.<br/><br/>Seems pretty fair to me :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445127/#Comment_445127" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-08T00:17:45+00:00" title="May  8, 2015 12:17AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting discussion!

At the end of the day, they've got to have a shortish session that can be made even shorter in the editing room without becoming completely incomprehensible.

So far, their presentation of Dread is doing that; that it isn't scaring me or bowling me over with its amazing storytelling is fine, because that's far beyond any reasonable expectation for a video like this.<br/><br/>(Basically I treat it like the descriptions my friend gives me about the games he plays at conventions.

At some moments it's like he's following a single rule to make a horror story: every single small action becomes even more difficult under stress. So he tries to convey this through the pull mechanics, instead of using it as a mechanism to give the players limited content control. He's partially right, because to convey horror in a game, you need to give the players less control of the world. <br/><br/>Yeah, that sounds suspicious, but it's somewhat true: D&amp;D plays in a different way from CoC (even if you play a D&amp;D adventure focused on horror and cthulhu mythos) because in D&amp;D player's class abilities give them more control over the world, while in CoC the threats are usually something you cannot handle trough worldly means. So, the less control the player has over the world, the more afraid she is about interacting with it. Until of course, there's enough information to find a way to deal with the threat; or until everyone dies, which isn't a bad ending for a horror story anyway (just an unsatisfactory one)<br/><br/>Also, the bag packing incident looks like an intent to have the players doom themselves: they are limited to choose only essential equipment quickly and poor choices will eventually be used against the players later. Will was probably expecting them to run leaving everything, but then the players rationalize that part and actually try choosing a bit and have some good ideas. Somewhat the players are only alarmed when they should be scared! So, he reacts like a veteran D&amp;D GM: "crap, that wasn't scary enough. Let's make this shorter, just roll the dice and we will see what you do and how good is it". Except that this isn't D&amp;D, rolling dice isn't the same as pulling. So yes, pulling here was wrong and thus it becomes obvious to the audience (if you know a bit more about the Dread rules)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445190/#Comment_445190" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-11T17:25:38+00:00" title="May 11, 2015  5:25PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A major reason to force pulls is pacing.

The GM would call for from 1 to 5 pulls based on stated goal/stakes (i.e., a 'degree of difficulty').<br/>2. The player could then declare traits from their questionnaire that would give them minus 1 pull each, but they had to narrate how it applied.<br/>3. Any player could call BS on the trait's applicability (though I think that only happened once, to someone who was clearly reaching).<br/><br/>I do not recall if that's RAW, but it worked REALLY well.<br/><br/>For example, for stabilizing the wounded guide, Wil could have said, "Yeah, he's hurt bad: he's dead unless you make three pulls" and then the player could have (for example) said, "Well, I'm very <b>steady handed</b> because of my exposure to injuries on the battlefield and I've gotten <b>advanced first aid training</b> as a Special Ops guy, so I'll only need to pull one."<br/>---<br/>Another thing I hope to see next episode is the rule that one needn't die immediately when the tower falls (Dead Man Walking). For a LOT of pulls, it's just stupid to insta-die; and it's fun to work out how a failed pull indirectly lead to death.<br/><br/>For the stabilizing example, if the tower fell, maybe the guy's chracter will be the first to be killed by the beast(s) because they smell all the blood on him...?<br/>----<br/>All in all, though, it's great to see indie RPG on TT again!
