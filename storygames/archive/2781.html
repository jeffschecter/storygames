It's pretty episodic, with discrete adventures focused on undermining a different Nazi project or expedition, often involving the Cthulhu mythos.<br/><br/>For the latest adventure (with elements shamelessly stolen from The Attrocity Archive, Global Frequency and Quatermass), I'd set up a situation where German military intelligence had discovered a mathematical conjecture, the solving of which would open the human mind up to possession by extra-planar entities, and had leaked an almost-finished version of it to British Intelligence via a double agent.  The heroes had discovered this plot, and had arrived on site at the Templar Barracks in Kent just as some of the possessed officers were starting to cause chaos and spread the possession using memetic warfare.  Quelling the problem there, they used their uncanny abilities to detect that some of the possessed individuals had fled days earlier and had set up operations in the village of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury" rel="nofollow">Avebury</a> in Wiltshire, which is built in the middle of an enormous, prehistoric stone circle.  <br/><br/>We left the session on a cliffhanger, with the heroes cresting the brow of a hill to see the stones of Avebury vibrating with an unearthly green glow that was beginning to spread outwards, threatening to create a shockwave that would engulf the worold and leave every human mind open to possession.<br/><br/>It turned out that none of the players had heard of Avebury outside of the classic BBC serial, Children of the Stones, and didn't realise that it was real.  In my opinion, it's one of the most awe-inspiring places I've seen and knocks Stonehenge into a cocked hat.  It occured to me just after the session that we should hold the next session of the game on site, among the stones.  <br/><br/>After checking that the players were all free, I took advantage of the bank holiday and drove them down to Avebury today (about a two hour drive from here).  We had a walk around to get the feel of the place, then found a comfortable place to sit, just outside the circle, and played through the climax of the game.  We did get some funny looks from passersby, while we were describing gunfights, explosions and alien nasties happening all around us, but it made the whole game come alive.  Being able to point at a building and say, "That just got taken out by mortar fire", or referencing a pen we had all seen a few minutes back as the scene of a battle with possessed, carnivorous sheep was quite wonderful.  We spent most of the drive back chuckling and grinning.<br/><br/>Has anyone else tried anything like this?  It's not quite the same feeling as a LARP, but certainly took an abstract act of imagination and turned it into something that felt oddly real.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63320/#Comment_63320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T13:35:03+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  1:35PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I adjusted the setting of my Amber game for Camp Nerdly to set it in Arden rather than Amber.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63333/#Comment_63333" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T14:36:19+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  2:36PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2007 2:38PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bliss Stage is necessarily set in the same area that you're playing in.<br/><br/>My experiences with the game are rough (it's playtesting!) but this aspect is universally awesome.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63339/#Comment_63339" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T15:01:46+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  3:01PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Avebury is one of my favourite places.
