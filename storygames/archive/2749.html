I've got two regular groups (1 weekly, 1 bi-weekly), one occasional group that is currently dug into AGON (meet 1-2 times a month), and from there a pool of dozens of local gamers that are doing things constantly; I often find myself going to a Saturday or Sunday odd game here and there. That's 8-10 days of gaming a month or so.<br/><br/>So there's running Iron Game Chef, which has a little impact, but not nearly as much as running it AND participating in it under a pseudonym (and writing 20+ pages). :-)<br/><br/>On the horizon, there's Camp Nerdly (which I'm looking forward to so much), and various local conventions in the summer.<br/><br/>And meanwhile, I'm trying to translate and edit, basically rewrite, a huge-ass game for release later this year.<br/><br/>Has anyone else found themselves in a situation of too much gaming?  What did you do to resolve it?<br/><br/>In my case, I think I have a plan: The bi-weekly group is cancelled this month because one member is in night school, and another member is having a child this month (and apologized profusely several times that he'll be missing gaming this month. That's hardcore). That will help unload some weight.<br/><br/>I think more weight will be lifted when I move the weekly gaming group to bi-weekly.  We've been floundering recently anyway, getting in some mediocre gaming in weekly rather than awesome gaming in bi-weekly.  Normally this group's motivation moves like a biorythm anyway, but cutting back to 2 weeks means that the GM for that group (usually me) can have more time to think, and everyone's a little more refreshed.<br/><br/>Writing/editing/translating the game will be a source of stress until it's Done; so the only thing I can do there is work faster.<br/><br/>Luckily, my Too Much Gaming sense was a general sense of stress after work that was blocking me from doing other stuff.  It didn't manifest in, say, my SO saying "you're gaming too much" or getting mad or anything like that. I just felt that at this rate, my batteries would be drained by summer, which is traditionally a time where more stuff tends to happen.<br/><br/>Has anyone else had too much gaming? What did you do to resolve the issue?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew%20D.%20Gandy" title="Matthew D.

What did you do to resolve the issue?</i><br/><br/>After running solidly on a weekly basis for about two or three years, I recently, and suddenly, ran out of gas. Sadly, I had at the time set myself up to continue with running new things: one weekly/bi-weekly and one monthly Spirit Of The Century.<br/><br/>To resolve the issue, I put a stop to the weekly/bi-weekly attempt before it really got off the ground. The monthly I'm not sure will really get off the ground because of scheduling difficulties. But if another session happens, I strongly suspect it will be the last (or at least the last I will run).<br/><br/>Further to my resolving the issue is me taking a rest from GMing for an "indeterminate length of time".<br/><br/>I'm still playing in a weekly group, but even that has not much enthusiasm for me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I will ever recover my enthusiasm for role-gaming, but I'm not worried about it. My biggest concern now is not whether I'll want to play again, but about disposing of the greater bulk of my gaming collection (something I was consdering for a long time before I came to the conclusion that I was grossly fatigued on roleplaying).<br/><br/>So, how I'm resolving the issue amounts chiefly to "taking a break", and filling my time with boardgames, which at this point I'm finding much more fun. When/if RPGs start being more fun again, I'll start inserting them back into my hobby time, most probably.<br/><br/>I guess another point of my resolving the issue is making sure that I replace the time I spent roleplaying with "play" (i.e. boardgames, or sports, or reading), and not just letting that time get taken over by "work" or "home". RPGs serve a leisure function, and just because you lose interest in one leisure activity doesn't mean you don't still need the same amount of leisure in your life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62766/#Comment_62766" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T08:41:15+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  8:41AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About a year ago I found myself with too much 'hobby' stuff, rather than too much specific RP stuff. In one month I would:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM two afternoons<br/>\nGo see two wrestling shows<br/>\nUpdate four different websites about three times a week<br/>\nModerate two busy messageboards<br/>\nWrite two 5000 word fanfics<br/>\nPlay in one PBEM<br/>\nRun organised play for a CCG in the UK<br/>\nPlay in two CCG tournaments<br/>\nGo to the pub with the lads four times<br/>\nRaided in WoW 12 nights a month<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on top of that, I have a job, a wife and two kids. Something had to give!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did was start a blog and aired my problem amongst my friends in a very second hand way which allowed me to discuss things objectively with them and moreover, with myself. I used that process of 'sticking it on a wall' to weed out the stuff that had a low hobby ROI (wrestling shows and PBEM), the stuff that was causing more stress than enjoyment (websites and GMing) and the stuff that could be put on hiatus (CCGs and fanfic). This allowed me to cut stuff back quite radically and sort of rediscover the fun stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realised that WoW was eating my life and the ROI was decreasing rapidly, whereas my ROI (thats Return on Investment, btw) for roleplaying in general was very high. So I swapped raiding for dabbling with game design. I discovered that rather than going balls to the wall with the CCG stuff, I could get the same enjoyment as a casual player. I found that I could join a fanfic group that was a lot less demanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, it gave me a chance to step back, look at things over a long term and re-establish my priorities. Now I'm playing an RPG regularly for the first time in literally years (rather than being the Iron DM), I write a little fanfic, play a little cards, play a little WoW, do NO organisation whatsoever and things are FAR better than they used to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62769/#Comment_62769" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T08:54:09+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  8:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2007 8:55AM by James Jeffers.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some guys have all the luck.<br/><br/>I know a guy, a long time gaming buddy that would frequently "quit" gaming. And within a few months he'd be back at it. Of course, it's clear to me now that perhaps his problem was either the way he was participating in the games or the sort of people he was gaming with. I don't think, fundamentally, this guy was really enjoying what he was doing. Gaming week in and week out only made the activity a more frequent source of pain.<br/><br/>I'm not sure he's ever going to solve this problem. Given a chance at another weekly game doing the same stuff he'd probably jump right into it.<br/><br/>Contrast this with myself - I consciously walked away from a weekly gaming group. My alternative was NO gaming, but in the end, it was better than CRAPPY gaming. The pain involved with the crappy gaming was so bad even to this day my instinct is to decline any invitation or notion of gaming. I have recurring nightmares where I'm running a game, and the players are just sitting there, staring at me. It's horrible. <br/><br/>So, let me ask you - is it really too much gaming, or is it substandard gaming that's sucking your sunshine? Do you find yourself wishing that you were truly happy and engaged with this activity? Do you look fondly on a some-when or where the participants were bright, cheery, and really wanted to be there with you doing this game? <br/><br/>(If you do, put that in a bottle and sell it, because I'm sure looking for a swig.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62770/#Comment_62770" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T08:58:09+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  8:58AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one more thing - I find that a huge stress (for me) is that when I think of running a game, my mind begins to frame in terms of the long-term, like never ending, commitment.

I find that usually my "too much gaming!" impulse is not when there's actually too much gaming, but that there's some blip in my gaming that's frustrating me.  Giving it time either allows that blip to iron itself out (like Jonathan's too-many-samurai problem) or identify what the real problem is (realizing that you never have time to clean the house, and the mess is driving you <em>crazy</em>).  Taking a week off is also an option: give yourself a breather.  I doubt your gaming buds would fail to understand, given everything that's obviously on your plate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62809/#Comment_62809" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T13:51:49+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  1:51PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, been there.  I just pretty much decided to back off a bit.  I cut back on the games I was playing and got a little 'me time' for myself.  That's when I taught myself to knit as a matter of fact.  But then I do that in fits and spurts.  I like Matt, seem to go back to computer games for a while, then that craving for personal interaction hits and I get back into table top games. <br/><br/>I'd say you sound like you just need a vacation from gaming for a while.

It seems like I've found my natural pace. <br/><br/>My regular GM engagement is GURPS Fantasy, which I run online for some good old friends from back home.  With kids and jobs and all the etcs, our scheduling is erratic but we do get in a four-hour session every three weeks on average.  Game-time rarity really helps make the game cook.  There's less time spent fiddling around with minutia, and we feel free to abort boring scenes with a die roll or narrative summary so we can get to the good stuff.  Best of all, the intervening weeks really help me get re-energized for the game.  I put a lot of energy into a traditional strong-GM session and I need the time to build up that charge again.   But by the time a new session rolls around, I'm aching to play.<br/><br/>There's also the 1-2 mondays a month I do with SGA, split evenly between GMing and playing, but these games are lazy-GM improv-driven storygames with a significant online component, and they don't demand that I supply nearly so much of the game energy.<br/><br/>My SotC / WRFP alternator <b>is</b> weekly.  I find I'm more of a casual player in those games, where I'm not jonesing to direct story or make my own thing happen.  I just want to chill, hang out with some of my favorite local geeks, and find out what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62884/#Comment_62884" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T06:21:39+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  6:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2007 6:22AM by John Anderson.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The chance of getting burnout would be a wonderful thing.

Obviously, it's a social activity, so if people are depending on you (you're running a game or you're an integral part of someone else's), you don't have to be a jerk and cut them off immediately.  Just make it clear that you will be finding a stopping point for all of the games that you simply don't have the time for, and then stick to that.  Most people will understand why you need to do it and will empathize with you.<br/><br/>When your list is down to a manageable number (no more than three regular activities is probably what you should aim for), things should look brighter and much less stressful.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63024/#Comment_63024" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T08:40:44+00:00" title="April  5, 2007  8:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in a similar situation. After bragging to all and sundry before christmas about how I was gaming "more than I did at uni", I've now come to the conclusion it's too much. My sunday night game (where we try out various indie games) and my mid-week game (where we alternate between Earthdawn and indie games) are still powerhouses of fun, but I'm finding my bi-weekly game and weekly online game (Etherscope) to be chores. And as I game for fun, not as a chore, I'm canning them after we finish our current runs. The second something stops being fun, it stops being done.<br/><br/>I think our Earthdawn game was on the cusp of becoming non-fun, but we collectively whacked the reset button on that last night so will see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
