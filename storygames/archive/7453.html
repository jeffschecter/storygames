Cut down like a flower in the prime of her life.<br/><br/>Now, I stand at her grave. They're lowering her in.<br/><br/>It wasn't supposed to be like this.<br/><br/><i>A Flower for Mara</i> is an improvisational play about death, loss, grief, and hope. In it, the cast members portray the immediate family of Mara, a woman who has died unexpectedly, during the first year after her death. We will see them deal with their loss - will they be able to lay aside their grief and continue on with their lives, or will they be trapped by their sorrow, unable to move forward?<br/>=====<br/><br/>As promised, <i>A Flower for Mara</i> is now available for sale. I sent copies to IPR, so I'm sure that they will be listed there soon. In the meantime, I have both hard-copies and PDFs available for sale direct from my website (<a href="http://www.darkomengames.com" rel="nofollow">www.darkomengames.com</a>).
