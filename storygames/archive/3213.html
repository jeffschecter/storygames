Not really important, because it's a stupid argument about GURPS vs. AD&amp;D, and most of my opinions have changed on the particulars of that discussion. But it was fun to discover this because I made some mention of a really old game design I was working on back then:</p>\n<pre><code>My system (originally) had four stats named Might, Heart, Sense, and\nWill, which were intended to correspond to the four elements of hermetic\nphilosophy.\n\nEach of these could be subdivided: Sense, for instance (which governs\nall sensory abilities  --  vision, memory, reaction speed, aim, &amp;c) could\nbe divided into skills, and these skills further divided into specialties.\nWhenever a character attempts a Sense task, any relevant skills are added\nto Sense to get a chance of success.  Thus, Penzak the Thief might have:\n\n     Sense 3   Stealth 3   Sleight of Hand 2  Pickpocket 2\n\nAll of which would add to a pickpocket attempt (the victim's relevant\nskills would SUBTRACT...)\n\nThis wasn't a rigid hierarchy  --  not only does the player decide\nwhich stats to divide and subdivide, but the player decides HOW to divide\nthem  --  as long as they make sense to the GM.\n\nThe other three areas work the same way: Heart governs all social and\nemotional tasks, and could include "Fear of Frogs" and "Fear of Giant\nAnimals," "Love of Money (greed)" etc.  --  all of which add or subtract\nfrom appropriate roles (any fear, for example, adds to a character's move\nwhen fleeing the object of fear, and subtracts from move when\napproaching it.) \n</code></pre>\n<p>That system would be Arkane, a game I never completed, and probably never will, since my interests have changed. But I'm glad I tracked that down, because these are probably the only remaining notes on that system. It helps to show me where I've been and where I want to go now.</p>\n<p>Also, it was just amusing to see that I had an interaction with John Kim that far back.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73215/#Comment_73215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T13:06:05+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  1:06PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2007 2:04PM by Andy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah! That's awesome!  <br/><br/>I never was into usenet, though I did spend a lot of time on U of Iowa's huge public text-only forums back in 94-96. I at one point recently came across this, a design for an alternate AD&amp;D 2E spellcasting system that I put together in 1994/95 and <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/rpg/newmagic.txt" rel="nofollow">uploaded a bunch of places via FTP</a>.<br/><br/>Luckily, somehow, it still exists, and untouched since 1995 pretty much:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.z-builder.com/rpg/cin/dragonmagic.htm" rel="nofollow">Here's a link!</a><br/><br/>"Dragon Magic allows player character mages to cast spells without memorizing them, as per the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition rules.  It is a system that is based on die rolls, spell points, and skill checks.  In the end, all aspects of the mage's spells balance out (in other words, there isn't too much power granted).  However, you will find the following differences in the Dragon Magic system; a lower level mage can cast more spells of his highest spell level;  a high level mage finds it more difficult to cast his highest level spells; a high level mage does not have access to all the spell slots granted by the 2nd Edition- it would be near impossible to cast all the spells possible by a \xe2\u20ac\u0153normal\xe2\u20ac\x9d 18th level wizard in a row."<br/><br/>Sounds boring, but in the AD&amp;D 2E days, it really made me want to play a magic-user... and I pretty much hated playing magic-users at that time (too much crap to remember, not as fun as rolling dice to hit stuff in combat, etc).<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDITED to add: If anyone else has Their Gaming Ideas of Old, I'd love for you to share them here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73218/#Comment_73218" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T13:14:43+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  1:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could port that to MageStrike Ultimus, Andy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73224/#Comment_73224" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T13:25:35+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  1:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Cool, Andy!
