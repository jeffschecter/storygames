Has anyone had issues of people giving the most barebones possible descriptions to get their dice for actions? I'm thinking something like "Okay, so I'm athletic, and this is a fencing duel, and I'm using a rapier. I'll roll 4 dice." without any further fun or embellishment. <br/><br/>I've become a big fan of mechanics not only encouraging, but downright requiring engagement with the game's fiction, but considering all the positive AP I've read about this, it's making me wonder if I'm getting *too* paranoid of more freeform stuff. So any anecdotes of the traits and tags spurring on awesome fiction, or the opposite, would be really helpful to me. Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298542/#Comment_298542" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T19:01:05+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  7:01PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2010 7:03PM by Jesse.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, this a danger in Lady Blackbird.  It's also a danger in Mouse Guard particularly with helping dice.<br/><br/>It's a problem that crops up in any system where you're supposed to describe what you're doing to justify using the die but in reality often the die is justified intellectually.  Look at your own example.  Assuming the character is an close combat situation is there any DOUBT those things relevant?  So adding the description really isn't about justification.  No one at the table is going to question the use of those traits.  They intellectually understand why they're applicable even without description of action.<br/><br/>In these kinds of situations this question has become my friend: "What does that look like?"  It can get kind of exhausting to constantly have to step in and say, "What does that look like?"  But some GMs don't seem to mind.  I like this question for two reasons.<br/><br/>1) It isn't confrontational.  As I said, no one is questioning the validity of the trait use; we just want more information.<br/><br/>2) It helps inform outcome description.  This is most obvious in the case of failure.  I've run into situations where I forgot to ask the question, the roll has failed and then I suddenly realized I had no idea what appropriate consequences were because I had no idea what was actually being done.  Fortunately this is salvageable just by asking, "EXACTLY what you were trying to do?"  The same is true for success.<br/><br/>So those are my thoughts.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298547/#Comment_298547" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T20:24:56+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  8:24PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play PbP, so that's a different dynamic, but the descriptions were usually nice but brief, followed by a quick justification for the dice the player was taking.

Instead, they need to think of it as a moment in a movie or comic. What they are doing is not saying what their character is doing "right now," but what the character is trying to accomplish in the scene. Once they realize they are framing the narrative action for a relatively longer span of time, and that their descriptions help develop the fiction over time, they will typically become much more comfortable with using their tags in inventive and fun ways, and will contribute more details.<br/><br/>A good comparison to give them is say, on the one hand, "I hit him with my rapier," and on the other hand, "With the footing so poor, I take advantage of the situation with my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">athletic</span> prowess, advancing with my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rapier</span> darting forward to puncture this poor fellow who had the audacity to challenge me to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fencing duel</span>."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298632/#Comment_298632" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T10:02:50+00:00" title="October 28, 2010 10:02AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jeff,<br/><br/>You should get your group together at the next possible opportunity and run the game. Seriously. You will all enjoy the hell out of it.<br/><br/>As for people dice-mongering, don't give it another thought. Let them. If one player is making every effort to get dice in uninteresting ways, it's fine. He'll win his conflicts and you'll throw up a new one. If another player is being much harder on herself, she'll lose her conflict, and you'll throw an interesting twist up for them. <br/><br/>Think of it not as win/loss but as different kinds of changes to the unfolding story.<br/><br/>Oh, and if the first guy is really being lame, rag on him (nicely) and encourage the others to do the same. He'll probably step up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298648/#Comment_298648" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T12:18:40+00:00" title="October 28, 2010 12:18PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for your input so far!<br/><br/>To be a little clearer, I'm not worried about "dice grubbing", to the contrary, I'm all about it! I'm just worried about boring, unengaging/lazy dice selection. If a player gives a hyper detailed, clear fictional description that hits all his traits/tags, well, sweet! Not as sweet would be a cursory explanation like "I hit the goblin with my sword". <br/><br/>Good call, Michael on stressing the intent and flexibility of time, I just read Burning Wheel and appreciated the intent/task distinction, but I didn't think about how it'd clarify the fictional significance of traits and tags in LB, so thanks for pointing that out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298664/#Comment_298664" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T13:30:48+00:00" title="October 28, 2010  1:30PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we played, conversation was frequently like, "I magically raise a wind to blow him out of the room, and...let's see, that's sorcerer, and wind magic, and this and that, and I'll use two pool dice" or "Naomi jumps the guards, and she's a pit-fighter and combat tested and brutal and this and that and that and that" and it was just great.  I don't think you need a sentence of narration to justify every separate tag.  Sometimes after the roll I would say, "You succeeded!  Narrate it."  Sometimes I'd narrate it myself.

People can be "lame" and just mention the tags they're using and roll, but you have some tools to make that a little more fun than it seems. I often let people narrate, and in my experience if they go for it with a lot of enthusiasm it either a) keys them to the fact that they can narrate their actions more or b) doesn't change a thing about their dice selection, but gets them pumped to narrate after the fact (oft times going back to the Traits/Tags/Secrets they used for inspiration).<br/><br/>Other times players just won't give a shit about being particularly creative with their dice selection. That's okay! If they have more fun gaming the system and letting you describe things to them, that's their prerogative.

I'm not as much worried about strong-arming people into being hippie-dippie narrating fiends (okay, maybe I want to, but I realize I can't), I guess I'm just worried about well-meaning players getting caught up in the heat of the moment and focusing on picking dice when they'd describe in more detail if there were a mechanical nudge of some sort.

"Are you attacking them because of your Key of Vengeance or are you trying to hit your Key of the Warrior? Vengeance? So, this isn't about a fair fight against a worthy foe. This is about payback, right? So, is Naomi overwhelmed by feelings of killing rage when she unloads on them? Awsome! Kale, this fight seems to be delaying the mission, when you could be running for the Owl. How do you feel about that? Really? So, are you trying to talk Naomi down? Snargle, how do you feel about all the carnage Naomi is causing? Kale's trying to stop her.

To begin with, an essential principle of the game is "to do it, you have to do it" which is to say that the mechanics are prescriptive and descriptive at the same time. And when a player forgets the description and is all "I Go Aggro on him. I hit 11, woohoo ! Who's next ?", all the MC (AW name for GM) has to say is "<i>Cool ! How do you do that ?</i>". This way, you first assert the action in the fiction, rewarding the player by complimenting him. And then, you ask him to describe what is happening in the fiction.<br/><br/><i>Cool ! How do you do that ?</i><br/>I love this sentence, it sounds heavily studied to enhance the social cohesion by prevent the classic "No no, don't roll the dice without describing" which is discouraging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299318/#Comment_299318" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T11:12:39+00:00" title="November  4, 2010 11:12AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2010 11:24AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "What does that look like?" is my go-to, most-used tool in my toolkit, I think.
