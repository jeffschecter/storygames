What do you bring?</a></strong>" thread, but since I'm not exactly sure what he's trying to do, and to prevent collision, I've split my idea into a new thread.)<br/><br/>So, here's the deal:<br/><br/>You begin by listing a series of items that you, the titular time traveler, bring with you to the time machine to stop those damn aliens. Your list can be eminently sensible, like a significant majority of people's responses to Matthijs' question, or nonsensical, like <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6028&amp;page=1#Item_22" rel="nofollow">mine</a>. If it's nonsensical, you can handwave it by saying that this isn't your first attempt in time travel, and you're a dirty cheater who doesn't give a damn about paradox.<br/><br/>Someone else, in their reply, basically narrates what you did with the items that you brought to stop those damn dirty aliens. If it's a sensible list, obviously some of these items don't get used. If the list doesn't really make any damn sense, then the respondent <em>must</em> use every item at least once. When does it not make sense? Dunno. Player judgment, I suppose. Maybe 'sensible' things are optional, and non-sequitur items are compulsory. The player then posts a new list, and the cycle repeats.<br/><br/>Anyway, I figure using my list would be terribly unfair, because I was just banging out things in random with no thought to making any sense. <br/><br/>Therefore, here's that list again:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite>A towel. Three toothpicks. A Qwardian Power Ring. A 17th century musket, loaded. A bathrobe. A colony of matter-transmuting nanorobots, suspended in a gel solution, good for six uses only, and programmed to stop once the colony encounters mica. Some slippers. A packet of beef jerky, vacuum-sealed. An empty glass. Three quarts of Glenlivet (1972) in a tumbler. An ice tray. A backpack. Two pairs of thongs. A box of condoms. The Emergency Retrovirus Injection Kit, with three spare needles. A skeleton key, date of manufacture circa 1882. A broken kukri, date of manufacture 1941. A vinyl LP (Rick Astley, <em>Whenever You Need Somebody</em>). A quill pen. Some rubbing alcohol.</blockquote>You have aliens to stop. Here's your manifest.
