There's kind of an assumption, I think, that game texts should teach people how to play the game "from the ground up", i.e. assuming that all terms need to be defined, that skills used in the game need to be taught, and so on.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, I think that's a very good assumption.  Certainly it's very useful not to assume anything on behalf of the players, especially if your game does something very different from established norms.  It's also probably better for newer players to have everything explained clearly.  No one likes having to do homework to play a game.  There are lots of reasons why it's good, really.<br/><br/>But is there room for an "expert" game? A game that assumes a bunch of skills, or uses idea from other games without going into detail to explain them?  For example, the game I wrote, "Savage Donjon Squad" uses pretty standard conflict resolution.  I learned a lot from games like The Pool and The Mountain Witch about how to run a game with fairly abstract conflict resolution, and how to make it fun.  A lot of the game text is dedicated to explaining how I go about doing that in play.  It's like, one page of actual rules, and then seven pages of advice on how to use those rules.  Is the game better for it?  A lot of people are much better than me at using conflict resolution to tell an exciting story.  They're <i>certainly</i> much better at doing that amongst people with whom they play regularly.  All that verbiage from me is probably not going to help them, and may in fact <i>hinder</i> their gameplay.  Would the game be better off if it gave the framework, and then said "do whatever works for you"? That's how I played it, and had fun.  I'm pretty certain that's what most experienced players would do with it as well, so why waste my time?<br/><br/>Reading The Mountain Witch, I really appreciated all the advice on how to frame exciting conflicts.  When I came to play, I certainl referred back to that advice when I was in a tough spot.  But at the same time, it did create a lot of stress, trying to play the game "right", the way the author intended it.  A lot of games, especially ones of the "conflict resolution mechanic plus funky emotional mechanic" school of design seem to be repeating a lot of the same text.  <br/><br/>So, is there a place for "expert" games? Or is the very idea crappy and elitist?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108931/#Comment_108931" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T22:54:48+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 10:54PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't <i>Sorcerer's</i> introduction says its something of an expert game and assumes you have some experience with RPGs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108932/#Comment_108932" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T23:17:36+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 11:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By my lights, most of the games out there, including mine, are "expert" games that often don't want to admit it.<br/><br/>Now, that's <i>pure </i>opinion.

I disliked them. I always like "what is roleplaying?" sections and so on. It told me exactly what kind of dynamic the game is allegedly looking for. Then I knew what I was dynamiting when I blew up the game.<br/><br/>For example, reading the intro to D&amp;D3 solves a shit-ton of problems about who is supposed to do what.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109034/#Comment_109034" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T18:24:00+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  6:24PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What lay behind my comments in the other thread was this: If you're going to have a section called "If you've never roleplayed before", then take the possibility of someone who's never roleplayed before picking up your game seriously, and explain it from the ground up. Don't use jargon like "GM", "NPC" and "PC" without explanation. Especially don't use them without explanation in the "If you've never roleplayed before" section, like one revered and otherwise excellently written game does.*<br/><br/>If you only expect people with some exposure to roleplaying to play your game, say so, and maybe direct those who haven't had such exposure somewhere that they can get the basic intro. <br/><br/>It's interesting that, off the top of my head, I'm not sure where that would be.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*Dogs in the Vineyard.
