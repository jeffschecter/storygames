From there, I just try to support and expand on player decisions as much as possible, with maybe a bit of detail-work between sessions (or on the fly - never be afraid to ask player for ideas!), and things usually go pretty smoothly. <br/><br/>I almost never prep beyond an initial idea for the session. I think "How should we kick it off?", which may be obvious depending on how last session wrapped up, and introduce my idea.

So, for example, writing some decent contracts (powers) for some of the factions that the PCs have joined was of critical importance, as was writing up the magic items and artifacts that they recovered from a heist at the end of the last plot arc.<br/><br/>As for plot, I generally just try to keep notes of what happened, and have several avenues (Apocalypse World folks would call these Fronts) of things that could come at the players, which I've pulled together from things that have arisen in play. Keeping track of details is important, but I rarely do more than vague pacing sketches for where things will go in the long term. <br/><br/>So in short I have almost twice as many pages of player mechanics as I have plot notes and prep - although I may be writing up a few reoccuring friendly NPCs, so that may technically change. On the other hand, those sheets aren't likely to be a secret - and among other things will enable a guest player to play her.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295630/#Comment_295630" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T14:32:05+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  2:32PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that notes on "What is the situation" and "What are the character issues" are the valuable prep.<br/><br/>I also find that "What I want to have happen" moves the fun from playing the game to plotting the game.

I've always found prep to be both valuable and fun, no matter what the game is.<br/><br/>The most valuable prep for me is laying out the finicky mechanical stuff in advance: if NPCs have weird powers, I want a page with that NPC and all the information I need to know about the weird powers all in one place.  If there's a location the PCs might visit that's a hundred feet up in the air with catwalks all over the place, I want all the information I need to know about falling, pushing people off, etc., all in one place.  Basically, this is me getting the heavy lifting out of the way so that I'm not flipping through the manual during the session, and it always (ALWAYS) pays off: even if I don't end up using it right away, I'm sure to use it eventually.  It can be interesting and entertaining, too: sometimes I really do like sitting around and futzing with the rules by myself, because it's not something you can do effectively during an actual game.<br/><br/>The most FUN prep for me is more like daydreaming.  I think about where we left off in the last session and what the players were talking about doing next; I think about the NPC antagonists, what they know, and what they plan on doing next; I think about likely locations the PCs will visit, interesting places I might want to put in their path, and what kinds of things might happen there; I think of a few goals for myself to try and work in during the session (situations that target a particular PC's interests and give them a significant choice to make, catastrophes that the party may have to face, NPCs I want to introduce); I even riff on some imaginary dialogue for NPCs, imagining little conversations for them so that I can tune their "voice" properly.<br/><br/>When it's done, I usually have two little stacks of paper.  One is reference material: NPCs and locations and situations with rules and stats listed, so that I can pull out whichever one I need in the moment.  The other is almost akin to a commonplace book, just a bunch of little ideas or lines gathered together that I can use to either give the players something to react to, or to react to the players.  There's also usually a very brief outline of how I <i>think</i> things might go during the session, with lots of empty space in it so that I can scribble down what actually <i>does</i> happen.  When the players are bantering with each other, I use that time to go back over my outline and my notes and reshuffle things to make better use of the best material I have on hand.<br/><br/><br/>As a player, I prep by: getting my character sheet in order (again, jotting down unusual rules in one place so that I don't have to flip through the book during play); thinking about what happened last time and what I'd like to do next; planning out ways to bring back NPCs I liked; and, of course, riffing on some conversations and thought processes that seem likely to happen, so that I can use that material during the actual game when the opportunity arises.  I usually go into the session with an excellent character sheet and a short list of ideas to draw upon.<br/><br/><br/>Generally, the way I look at prep is that it's a tool to <i>increase</i> flexibility (by giving yourself time to consider more options and creating a larger set of resources to use in the game) while also increasing quality (by giving yourself time to fix your dumbest ideas and refine your best ones...and for zero-prep games, even doing some improv exercises before you show up to play is helpful and valuable!).  It's a way to get to have fun with the game even on the nights when you're not getting together with your friends to play.  It's also dead fucking easy to do, and I say that as a man who is ridiculously lazy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295654/#Comment_295654" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T16:53:23+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  4:53PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Accounting for Taste, thanks for bringing up player prep!

But there's loads of prep I can do without planning the adventure. If I watch a movie or read a book to get source material, that adds to the game, rather than constraining it. If I research 1930s Shanghai, that's something I'm bringing to the game, not something I'm imposing on it.<br><br>It's worth playing, sometime, with people who have really done their research. This is why I like Cthulhu adventures at conventions: usually, the Keeper will have researched their setting well. There's a real difference between inventing 1930s Shanghai on the fly and describing what 1930s Shanghai was like. It's really fascinating to bring that bit of prep into the game.<br/><br/>If we don't prep, I think we often end up playing pastiches. For example, Apocalypse World can end up of a pastiche of half-remembered Mad Max movies, unless you actually read some postapocalyptic stuff to inspire the setting. Fantasy games can become a blur of Generic Fantasy, unless you read Gormenghast and Tales of the Dying Earth.<br/><br/>So I basically think prep is important and it's a trick we're missing. One reason I like Fiasco so much is that its playsets find a way to incorporate setting into the game, without it becoming an uncomfortable constraint. If that isn't prep, it's in the same ballpark. I would like more of that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295747/#Comment_295747" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-03T07:20:14+00:00" title="October  3, 2010  7:20AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you, Graham.

Each picks a "demesne": a region of space and time where they're currently located. Then the GM is encouraged to research these demesnes.

I discovered that running D&amp;D3.5 was much smoother if I worked out a half-dozen encounters, with monsters, treasure, and tactics.  In GURPS, taking time to prep means I think of things I wouldn't have thought of otherwise, and there are enough rules that it's always good to review the ones you think you're likely to need in an encounter.<br><br>I also learned a long time ago that the most satisfying prep doesn't happen when I focus on the plot, but when I focus on the situation.  What do the other players in the situation want to happen?  What are they likely to do?  I do think about the plot, in the sense that I have some idea of what the characters are likely to do, and I try to set things up so that cool things will happen as a result -- either good-cool or bad-cool; but I've also found that forcing a plot so that cool things will happen is not as satisfying as working out what will happen. <br/><br/>As far as goals go, I think about how much time the next game session will cover, and then instead of having my goals for the game I have my NPCs' goals for that span of time.  Again, for much the same reason that plotting is problematic.  I love to play to find out what happens.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295824/#Comment_295824" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T10:47:01+00:00" title="October  4, 2010 10:47AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finding songs to go with PC's, NPC's, and situations really helps me, even though this is the kind of hippie GM stuff that usually makes me reach for my revolver.  <br/><br/>And then thinking and wondering about the characters, the NPC's, what might happen next, dreaming up cool things and places but trying not to get attached to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295900/#Comment_295900" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T06:22:48+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  6:22AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the trick is to plan for some situations, but not their outcomes.

Prep can be helpful even if the events aren't planned.  If I familiarize myself with the metropolitan area of Greater Vancouver in advance and I have an adventure that centres around Kitsilano then my prep is a benefit if the players go "off-script" and decide to go to Lynn Valley instead.  By preparing and familiarising myself with the areas outside of the planned adventure can let me more easily create an interesting atmosphere and narration for my players if they end up going off in an unplanned direction.  If they decided to purchase tickets at YVR for Johannesburg or Dubai, I'm in trouble, but I can always improvise an adventure that takes place on the trans-Atlantic flight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296460/#Comment_296460" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T00:38:29+00:00" title="October 11, 2010 12:38AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I think prep's incredibly important and it's something we miss in indie games</blockquote>\nAlthough I have always found a lot of value in Sorcerors' Relationship Maps and Bangs as approaches to preparation that create the conflict within which story occurs without leading to railroading by defining outcomes.

You had a description of where and what things were now, NPCs, monsters, magic items and maybe a map.  Possibly a handout for the players to read.  When I got back into RPGs a few years ago and started reading various bulletin boards , I was astonished at the idea that the GM could or should direct a <em>plot</em>.  You just dropped the PCs into the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">maze</span> scenario, and then you ran the NPCs and adjudicated the PCs' actions. But I had come from a fairly insular gaming culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296863/#Comment_296863" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T10:23:14+00:00" title="October 14, 2010 10:23AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I think prep's incredibly important and it's something we miss in indie games.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>If we don't prep, I think we often end up playing pastiches. For example, Apocalypse World can end up of a pastiche of half-remembered Mad Max movies, unless you actually read some postapocalyptic stuff to inspire the setting. Fantasy games can become a blur of Generic Fantasy, unless you read Gormenghast and Tales of the Dying Earth.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThis has been kind of gnawing at me.  Your book was something of a revelation because in a way it said:  Go obvious, it's okay if it's pastiche / trope / cliche, what's obvious to you might not be obvious to the next guy, and probably won't suck.<br/><br/>And adopting this as a GM this has allowed me to run rules-light pickup games where I just say, "What setting or genre do you guys want to play in?"  And then in play I can fish to figure out exactly what they want, and, yes, it always has been pastiche, but still unique.  And they're happy because they're playing in their chosen setting and totally engaged;  I'm happy because I didn't have to prep and I get to watch the magic unfold...<br/><br/>And now you're telling me that's not good enough!  I must shut my ears.  I'm having fun this way, damn it, I know I am.<br/><br/>Besides, isn't Star Wars pastiche, or a blend of pastiches?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
