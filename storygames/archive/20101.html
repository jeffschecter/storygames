I want feedback on how to pitch this game as much as I want commentary on the content. I feel a bit cheeky anyway, as I'm not really an active part of the community, though I lurk here quite a bit and read the weekly mailouts. Ahem.)<br/><br/>In October of last year my wife and I published <a href="http://www.timralphs.com/there-is-something-in-the-woods" rel="nofollow">There is Something in the Woods</a>, a free-to-download, one-off, table-top storygame of supernatural survival horror. The game does some cool (but not enormously innovative) things with framing the GM's role as that of Director and is written with the intention that, if everyone at the table has played the game once or twice you won't need a Director at all.<br/><br/>Play is rooted pretty deeply in genre conventions and expects the players to switch between rooting for their characters and introducing troublesome elements into the world. The game is driven by the idea that, in horror settings, what's actually interesting is the small group dynamics that emerge; the way people stand together or stab each other in the back as tension mounts. Most of the time when I've played it, one or two people have made it out of the woods alive. The rest have been taken by The Thing.<br/><br/>For 1st April, we were planning on releasing a hack for the game called "The Folly of Hope", which should make the game marginally less cruel. That's still in playtesting and I welcome any feedback anyone might have from reading it through:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utgrzmSxe0e4M5mAmKqEidzBN78y6Pj4ksHE10N4viU/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utgrzmSxe0e4M5mAmKqEidzBN78y6Pj4ksHE10N4viU/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>But the big questions I have are all around pitching this game to people. What sort of stuff would excite you to play this game? Mentioning movies like Blair Witch Project or The Grey? Focusing on the mechanics, the cycle of day and night, the way that individual survival is pitted against group survival, or the interesting role of the Director? Should I be spinning stories from actual play?<br/><br/>Any suggestions gratefully received.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
