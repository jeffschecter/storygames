Or maybe if you want to play OSR with newcomers who haven't played other editions and you're worried they may find them too complicated. <br/><br/>Not that 2e is too complicated but personally, I learned D&amp;D from 3.5 and trying to figure out a 2e book confused me more. But it's the same when you have first played 2e for years and you try to adapt to 3.5 or pathfinder (I've seen the case)<br/><br/>Rules apart, OSR for me is more about how you handle the rules, state the challenges and ask the players how to solve them. It's less dice-rolling and more thinking/roleplaying. And for the power level, you can always limit leveling or use of certain skills/class abilities/spells to your preferred point. You can do that with any system you have mastered.<br/><br/>Now, going more RAW and considering the GM has not fully mastered the game, would 5e produce OSR playing from the start? Well, I'd say that at least it would go, say, more OSR than 3.5 and PF (Can't say it for 4e since I haven't played it) but not as fully as 2e or OSR recent games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448631/#Comment_448631" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-19T05:20:05+00:00" title="September 19, 2015  5:20AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with WarriorMonk's assessment, and I *have* played lots of 2E and 4E as well as 3.X.<br/><br/>Now, 5E gets *less* OSR-ish in the sense of deadliness as you level up. PCs are pretty fragile for the first few levels but it gets harder for them to outright die after that. There is still a sense of fragility, though: I inflicted serious pain on a party of 3 14th-level PCs with 3 CR 8 monsters simply through luck and because (due to fictional positioning) one of them was separated from the other two at the start of the fight. This general sense that PCs aren't immortal even at high levels has several sources:<br/><br/>1) Bounded Accuracy: low-level monsters can still hit high-level PCs more than 5% of the time\u2014even if it's only 20% of the time, that still changes things radically from the situation in high-level 3E or even 2E, where Orcs become a joke. In 5E sufficiently large numbers of low-level foes can indeed cause problems even to a big group of PCs, though it's rare that you'd actually want players to fight, say, 100 Orcs. What's nicer, though, as I alluded to above, is that *mid-level* monsters can still be a challenge for *high-level* characters.<br/><br/>2) The way saving throws work. A lot of people on Big Purple complain about this, but I think it's brilliant: by default, without spending Feats or ability score increases or getting a magic item or whatever, 4/6 of a character's saves will not improve throughout the entire course of the game. This means that it's always worthwhile to try to avoid even letting the enemy cast their spell or use their ability in the first place: in other words, 5E supports "combat as war" where 3E and 4E aimed for "combat as sport."<br/><br/>This is, incidentally, why everyone complains about the CR system being so wonky. I don't necessarily disagree that it could have been a little more smoothly-implemented, but fundamentally, most of the complaints about it stem from misunderstanding the function of the system.<br/><br/>3) The relative caster-nerf. I say relative because full casters are still awesome (and, unlike in 3rd edition, the semi-casters [Paladins and Rangers] and even 1/3 casters [Eldritch Knights, Way of the Four Elements Monks, and Arcane Tricksters] actually get serious utility out of their spells*). But, even full casters get significantly fewer <i>high-level</i> slots per day than they did in the past, which is notable\u2014again, I didn't find it all that hard to challenge a 14th-level party as long as I kept the pressure up: they could get out of a jam or two by blowing their big spells, but after that they had to be pretty conservative. Also, the concentration rules mean that casters cannot just spend 3 rounds outside the door of the big bad's cave turning the PCs into demigods via buff spells. There are good buffs, to be sure, but again, the PCs have to actually be strategic about their use.<br/><br/>Now, I do have some serious criticism of the para-text, the advice for using the rules, particularly in the DMG. 5E really is trying to be all things to all people, and thus shies away from outright telling readers a lot of the stuff I'm saying here\u2014things that, I think, are important for gamers trying to get the most out of it to understand.<br/><br/>I'd also like to note that, although it is OSR-supporting in many ways, it does also have story-game elements, in the BIFTs and Inspiration. How much or how little a particular group plays those up actually does little to determine how gritty the game will feel\u2014the bonus from Inspiration is small enough that it's rarely pivotal. Rather, to me it's simply a question of whether the players bother to portray their characters as interesting people or not.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*In 3rd edition, many of the "semi" caster classes felt a little weak because their spells felt like "too little, too late" to really compete with the godlike power of the full casters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448666/#Comment_448666" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-21T20:48:33+00:00" title="September 21, 2015  8:48PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>What an excellent breakdown!

I was surprised to see mentions of 2e, 3e and 4e in this thread.<br/><br/>As for deadliness, if I recall correctly, boosting survivability with levels is as old-school as it gets.  In my OSR play, level 1 characters have always been cannon fodder, level 2-3 slightly less so, and only level 4+ characters are worth spending significant resources to keep alive.  Whether a given group wanted to keep playing with higher-level characters vs just keeping everything low-level and deadly seems to me to be more about play culture than rules... with the exception of the rules for how quickly you get how much XP for what actions and achievements.  Some OSR games are very stingy with XP so you don't get to 4th level before dozens and dozens of sessions.<br/><br/>Historical trivia aside, I am very curious to see how BIFTs and Insp go over.  Are they embraced?  Used grudgingly?  Ignored?  <br/><br/>I don't currently know any OSR folks to ask, but I know some Pathfinder guys I'm hoping to hear more from.  The first news I got was, "I miss all the system-optimizing and sick character builds I used to do!"  The second, a bit later, was, "Actually, I really like 5e!"

However, since I am the self-proclaimed King of Grognards (80-90% of what I play regularly came out before 1990) I personally think I should be in there somewhere.<br/><br/>From the instant 5th was announced I was excited beyond containment and hanging on every developer word. This is mostly because as central as BECMI/1st/2nd was for us, we felt abandoned by 3rd and 4th.<br/><br/>The initial promises were what I considered the best possible compromises we could expect from a major commercial release...IF they managed to follow through. About the time development on it changed I started getting scared and on the WotC forums even predicted it was going to switch to edition 3.75 by launch. By the time development ended I was almost totally negative about its chances.<br/><br/>After giving it some time I've begun to play it a bit to give it a full chance. I will say that we don't play it very much, so I'm far from expertly versed in it. That being said I think it's FAR better than I feared, but it's also very close to what I thought it would be. It's just that it's also a fairly good game despite that.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that it's not closer to Basic/1st/2nd in my opinion. I tell people now that it's reminiscent of the older games...it alludes to them, gives a nod to them, but does so within an almost entirely modern framework. I would say 3.75 is the closest edition numbering for it. It's 3rd edition, with a modern independent hack overlay, as it would be played by people who preferred the old school 'roleplaying, not rollplaying' style.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that most of its professed 'modularity' is missing, or broken. We've tried to swap various things in and out almost entirely without success. It's really meant to play more or less as is. If you're going to try and hack it closer to what you prefer you have limited options and it gives the game a chaotic, unfinished feeling...at least without going beyond the included options and making it a full homebrew.<br/><br/>With that said I think there's a lot of really good things, or least good attempts. I love the new save system, approve of bounded accuracy, think some of the indie-inspired options have merit (especially for newer players), love the streamlining and simplification, etc. I think it plays well as the system it is, just like 3rd and 4th did. Good games in their own rights...just not what I generally mean by D&amp;D. <br/><br/>I'm in no way concerned by it, but neither do I feel much like playing it (other than as a forced endeavor to ensure giving it a fair try). We still play 3.5 regularly (mostly for our kids that grew up on it), but otherwise would ALWAYS choose BECMI or 1st/2nd. Well, actually we play our own version, but barring that it'd be those. <br/><br/>It's a pretty cool game, but I see it as it's own game, and not a continuation of the D&amp;D lineage (which for us stopped with 2nd). However, i'm ENORMOUSLY biased as D&amp;D was probably the single most impacting thing in my life (outside of like, marriage, child, and death...and it even gives those a serious run).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs" title="sbrplaysrpgs"><img alt="sbrplaysrpgs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/050/n24UD1GW770MM.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sbrplaysrpgs">sbrplaysrpgs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448675/#Comment_448675" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-22T09:44:20+00:00" title="September 22, 2015  9:44AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only played the new edition 5 or 6 times and also only play OSR games sporadically (mostly something along the lines of Swords &amp; Wizardry (0e), B/X retro-clones or Neo OSR games (Beyond the Wall, Scarlet Heroes, Whitehack).  <br/>I'm not an expert on either the OSR nor D&amp;D 5.<br/>Imho 5e does a good job. It streamlined the mechanics from 3.5 and introduced some new "narrative" stuff (Inspiration, Backgrounds etc.) I like how the handled the spell mechanics.  <br/>It's also nice to see that characters are not as powerful as in 3.5 (as Deliverator pointed out with much more expertise).<br/><br/>However, it <b>doesn't feel old school to me</b>. I like modern games so that's not necessarily a problem but I don't see 5e as OSR. As already said, it flirts with some ideas from the older D&amp;D editions. Granted, we play it as written without any adjustments from the DMG.<br/>(I'm a bit sad that it the modularity seems broken as Phoenix182 said. I don't own the DMG, so I can't say anything about that.)<br/><br/>So, to answer your questions:\n<blockquote>If you identify as an OSR person, OSR lover, enthusiast, or anything similar... how has this promise held up for you?</blockquote>\nNo, the promise hasn't held up for me.\n<blockquote>Are you playing D&amp;D5E and loving it?</blockquote>\nYes, I play it because it's our common demoninator. The GM doesn't like old school and those in our group that like it, are still very satsified with 5e.\n<blockquote>Were you disappointed?</blockquote>\nNope but I didn't have high expectations. In fact, I didn't follow the development and after the disappointment of 4e I expected to skip this edition. I was pleasantly surprised what came out of 5e.\n<blockquote>Do you feel relatively unconcerned about it?</blockquote>\nEh....\n<blockquote>What has your experience with D&amp;D5E been like?</blockquote>\nWhile I think it's a good game I still prefer other games. The inspiration mechanic doesn't work in our group. I am perfectly happy with my old school games and they are still simpler than 5e. As I like lightweight games, I'd rather play the aforementioned old school/OSR games than 5e. 5e just doesn't deliver anything I couldn't have with other games.<br/>For example, when it comes to resource management and combat, I like 6d6RPG better (<a href="http://dieheart.net/6d6rpg" rel="nofollow">dieheart.net/6d6rpg</a>) and when it comes to the D&amp;D feeling I see nothing wrong with Basic Fantasy or any other old school game.<br/>Several people also wrote about the bad organization of the published campaigns. If you're the GM you need to invest a lot of work into making them playable. So that's not a plus for 5e either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448677/#Comment_448677" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-22T12:58:30+00:00" title="September 22, 2015 12:58PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as another datum, I also felt weird at seeing 2e listed at old-school. 2e is the dumb new version of AD&amp;D that is proof-positive that TSR only wants our money and a good reason to stop buying their stuff (which is what I did about that time). :-)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448679/#Comment_448679" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-22T14:37:57+00:00" title="September 22, 2015  2:37PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Christopher, 2e pioneered the new standard of art!

It's there, but it's in the DMG and is fairly weak.<br/><br/>2) How easy it is to use 5E to accomplish different creative goals than the default "heroic fantasy."

I think you essentially nail it with your qualifier at the end. We were completely versed in BECMI &amp; AD&amp;D (more often the latter), and had even the oddball detail items integrated (we used speed factor, age &amp; gender attribute modifiers, and even weapon attack adjustments versus AC quite often). It was treated like a personal simulation of a miniature wargame rules-wise, and relied almost entirely on player immersion, story and characterization play-wise.<br/><br/>When 2nd first came out we were momentarily skeptical, then fell into their mindset and decided it was a rational evolution for the most part. Ok, we griped about the loss of darkness (demons/devils, etc), we missed the original deities and demigods, we wanted the assassin and college druid back, etc. There were dozens of dislikes, but the cleaned up organization and enormous flood of specialized settings kept us so entertained we barely cared. It wasn't uncommon for us to have 3-5 campaigns going on in the same week...with mostly the same players!<br/><br/>Anyway, because we were so used to AD&amp;D we essentially treated 2nd like a cleaned up, more organized evolution of it, instead of the very different game that it really was. It wasn't until we started redesigning D&amp;D when 4th came out that we realized what a change it had been. Since them when we go back and play it it's an entirely different experience. I still think there were some good thoughts behind it, and it remains probably the single most played game at our tables. However when I have to pick THE game for me, it's BECMI or AD&amp;D, for everything except setting/fluff. That realization has led to some of the MOST old-school feeling sessions in 20 years when we actually dust one of them off to play now.<br/><br/>It was also 1992-1996 that adulthood caught up with us and changed our gaming paradigms. The groups fragmented somewhat, other things became important, and we found a LOT of entirely different games we all wanted to try out. I think that, more than the editions themselves, are what separates 'old school' from new for me. So many of the old greats were either abandoned or drastically changed around that time that it seemed to represent a fundamental shift in gaming ideology. Without question 3rd is a fully 'modern' game to us (I suppose shifting the current indie craze into the 'post-modern' category). I usually talk about pre-3rd/post-3rd gaming as a pretty sharp divide. Obviously I also relate nearly every aspect of gaming to D&amp;D as the central thread/yardstick.<br/><br/>Damn you...got me monologuing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448699/#Comment_448699" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-23T14:42:55+00:00" title="September 23, 2015  2:42PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna have to go back and like, read 2e, because I don't remember any meaningful differences from AD&amp;D beyond clean up and generally making more sense.

Classes are missing/changed, or would appear in later works in different forms (like kits). Also the classes are now shoehorned into groups around the 'core 4'. Minor tweaks to races (and 1/2 orc missing). Many things are rates or options instead of a chart/table (THAC0, NWP, thief skills, priest spheres/wizard schools, etc). Psionics finally playable (if just barely). Experience awards altered. Level limits/race restrictions eased. Surprise &amp; inititative changed. Weapon vs armor tables replaced with type vs armor. No segments. Some pretty significant monster changes (demons/devils, dragons, etc). Attribute ranges broadened (and gender differences abolished). Loss of unique spell lists. I could go on, but these are some of the biggies.<br/><br/>Then there are a host of other things that may not be picked up on, or subtle effects from the obvious changes, that actually have major implications.<br/><br/>By changing from tables to rates on things (like thief skills) you're leaving 'simulation' and moving more towards 'gaming'...specifically towards build options, min/maxing, power gaming, etc.<br/><br/>Even though classes are grouped by 'core 4', abandoning the subclass concept shifts us towards the idea of all classes (and levels) being unique and equal. This is a gamists specificity mindset, as opposed to simulationists general representation one.<br/><br/>By changing from rules to options on so many things (weapon type vs armor, unlimited advancement, etc) you're reinforcing 'building', and thereby the gamist preference. The same is sometimes true of the inverse, changing from option to rule (NWP for instance). It also continues the shift from simulationist, but this time towards narrativism.<br/><br/>Kits open the door to prestige classes and class spam, while devaluing 'class'. This is further reinforced with the loss of level titles.<br/><br/>Loss of unique casters/spell lists drastically alters the feel of magic, as well as setting the stage (but confusing) power sources.<br/><br/>Many of the changes create much stronger characters. This both decreases lethality and begins the power inflation.<br/><br/>Experience award changes shift away from treasure, and towards combat. However, they also include stronger support for other awards (like roleplaying), which kicks off much of the current indie concepts tying roleplaying to mechanical aspects. Either way, the core idea of 'smart play' is largely abandoned.<br/><br/>Easing of reality rules (and dark themes) moves us towards political correctness, and also power inflation and precious snowflakeism. For instance, penalties for low ability scores are relaxed, and no longer limit choices as much.<br/><br/>Considerable loss of wargaming, kingdom level focus, and anything concerning the full mythic arc of a hero (like with the failure to include immortality rules from BECMI). Interestingly this is somewhat resurrected with the Birthright setting, and Greyhawk Wars.<br/><br/>Changes in things like NWP, and increased rules specificity lead us out of roleplaying and into rollplaying.<br/><br/>Again, I could go on and on, but these are the types of things I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So for those of us coming from 1st and basic we didn't notice most of those changes, and continued trying to play the way we had, just with things cleaned up. In doing so we missed the actual game...which may not be a bad thing, depending on preferences.<br/><br/>Looking back now I see 2nd as a gateway game...the transition from old-school to modern. It's literally the 2 between 1 and 3. If I had to rule one way or the other now, I'd say it's modern. However, at the time we neither saw that, nor played it that way, allowing it to remain old-school in practice (if not theory). Besides that, there's more than enough elements from AD&amp;D/basic for it to be worthy of the 'old-school' nod.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448707/#Comment_448707" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-23T23:01:19+00:00" title="September 23, 2015 11:01PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me BECMI and AD&amp;D are two entirely different games. BECMI is narrativism, AD&amp;D simulationism. BECMI is light and epic, AD&amp;D is gritty and noir. BECMI is superheroic, AD&amp;D is gimpy/realistic. <br/><br/>However I also tie basic to Mystara. We never played a different setting with basic, and probably never would. Mystara is BECMI, and BECMI is Mystara. While that's not entirely accurate (Blackmoor anybody), it's the way it played out for us, and now is unchangeable. <br/><br/>So those are the considerations for which to play. As I mentioned, we now use our own edition more than either of the originals, and it incorporates much from all editions (including both Mystara and Greyhawk settings).<br/><br/>Pre-2nd<br/><br/>Blackmoor, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, The Horde, Kara Tur/Oriental Adventures, Maztica (was hinted at in 1st, but not officially released until 2nd), Greyhawk, Lankhmar, Mystara, Savage Coast (hinted at only in BECMI, not officially released until 2nd), Pelinore, Ravenloft (began in 1st, but not fully realized until 2nd), Spelljammer, and the Underdark (began before even 1st, but again not fully realized until 2nd).<br/><br/>Everything else is post 2nd only (14-18 different settings, depending on where you put the 4 noted above).<br/><br/>While that looks like a lot in 1st/basic, in reality most of those were pretty bare-bones until the 2nd edition reprintings. Very seldom were the 1st edition versions what people remember when they think 'campaign setting', even when they absolutely got their start during 1st/early basic.<br/><br/>For me I generally think of pre-2nd settings as:<br/><br/>Blackmoor, Mystara, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Kara Tur/OA, Lankhmar, and Spelljammer. Pelinore definitely was too, but we didn't hear about it much in the US until much later.<br/><br/>One of the defining elements of 2nd edition campaign settings was the willingness to alter (or abandon) mechanical canon. Only Dragonlance, Lankhmar, and the oriental settings really had much in the way of unique classes or mechanical rules during the 1st edition releases. Otherwise it was all just setting and fluff.<br/><br/>However many (if not most) of the 2nd edition campaign settings included entirely different rules/races/classes, making them truly unique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448711/#Comment_448711" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T03:30:05+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  3:30AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played (or even read) the BECMI.

Things are simpler, more fantastic, more sweeping, and closer to the grand mythic narrative. With so much out of the way it lends itself more readily to story focus.<br/><br/>Then there are some specific things: focus on kingdoms (especially formation, but also administration and interplay), built in paths to immortality, some fairly epic spells and weapon abilities (via the mastery system)...and while those aren't wholly unique in basic there are fewer constraints on them, etc. It all leads to somewhat cleaner focus on the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448714/#Comment_448714" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T06:06:50+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  6:06AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see.

We missed them at the time, and just kept playing 2nd as if it was a cleaned up 1st. Viewing it detached now it's pretty easy to see how different it really was.<br/><br/>People can disagree about the exact intrinsic effects, but we can look at 3rd and 4th and 5th to establish a continuum. From that we can extrapolate some likelihoods, as I did before.<br/><br/>They weren't supposed to interrelate. They're two different products. I mean you can, but you can relate D&amp;D to Gamma World, or other TSR products. That doesn't mean you're supposed to combine them, or move from one to the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448716/#Comment_448716" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T07:43:53+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  7:43AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting.  I've never heard that (narrative-supporting) before about BECMI -- most people I know today who are eager to go back to this old system seem to want to do so for the complete <i>opposite</i> of "story" reasons.  They're usually in it for fiction-based (as opposed to rules-based) problem-solving, and an emphasis on dungeon crawls.  I had no idea there was an "epic" dimension to it.  I wonder if this is a difference between BECMI and the stuff that came <i>even earlier</i>...  Some of my friends play "red box" or "white box" and the stuff they rave about (in addition to the simpler rules you mentioned) is wandering monster rolls, XP for treasure, quick char-gen to replace all the PCs who die, quality dungeon modules, and refereeing rather than plot-guiding as GM.  <br/><br/>Most of the stories I've heard from "old school" play involve cleverly not dying; epic achievements are nowhere in the picture.<br/><br/>I got the impression as far back as 1990 that players who wanted their characters to be or become absurdly badass had plenty of newer games for that; no need to track down old D&amp;D editions.<br/><br/>Again, though, this might be a case of it being different if you were there in the first place.  The difference between Old School Renaissance and just plain Old School, perhaps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448717/#Comment_448717" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T07:58:59+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  7:58AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I got the 2e PHB, something about either the book itself or the way my friends introduced it to me made me think that the point of roleplaying was unfettered imagination.  It did not occur to me that we might spend that opportunity in dungeons trying to stay alive.  So we didn't.  We saved the world and conquered stuff and the XP flowed like wine and we became like unto gods.  If we got psyched about a cool item in a book, we had to have it.

I've never heard that (narrative-supporting) before about BECMI -- most people I know today who are eager to go back to this old system seem to want to do so for the complete <i>opposite</i> of "story" reasons.  They're usually in it for fiction-based (as opposed to rules-based) problem-solving, and an emphasis on dungeon crawls.  I had no idea there was an "epic" dimension to it.  I wonder if this is a difference between BECMI and the stuff that came <i>even earlier</i>...  Some of my friends play "red box" or "white box" and the stuff they rave about (in addition to the simpler rules you mentioned) is wandering monster rolls, XP for treasure, quick char-gen to replace all the PCs who die, quality dungeon modules, and refereeing rather than plot-guiding as GM.  <br/><br/>Most of the stories I've heard from "old school" play involve cleverly not dying; epic achievements are nowhere in the picture.<br/><br/>I got the impression as far back as 1990 that players who wanted their characters to be or become absurdly badass had plenty of newer games for that; no need to track down old D&amp;D editions.<br/><br/>Again, though, this might be a case of it being different if you were there in the first place.  The difference between Old School Renaissance and just plain Old School, perhaps.</blockquote>\nI suppose it matters rather you're inherently a narrator/creator, or inherently a gamer. I was the former, so all I needed was a rough framework to get out of my way and let me tell some stories. <br/><br/>There's no mechanical ties to story as in modern indie stuff (inspiration, goals, etc), but also no heavy mechanics to bog it down like there are in more sim-focused games (like 1ed). <br/><br/>Add to that a system that includes within every 36lvl arc a way to become first a King or Queen, and then finally a literal God (the I in BECMI), and how could it be anything BUT epic?<br/><br/>I mean, in several 1ed games you actually kill princes of Hell, or Demogorgon, or Tiamat, or the Tarrasque, or full deities. You travel the very planes of existence, sometimes in magical spaceships. You can stop time, bring back the dead, and cast down entire civilizations with the wave of a hand and a few recited words. You lay claim to treasures with higher values than entire nation-states! The Bloodstone Pass modules are for levels up to 100.<br/><br/>If that isn't the definition of epic I have no idea what is.<br/><br/>That's not to say it was ALL epic. At low levels you're a freaking porcelain doll at a rodeo, and yes, it's ALL about being clever enough not to die (via narration rather than rules). However those moments are fleeting. In fact our biggest gripe about D&amp;D (every version, but least of all basic) has always been you don't start clueless/weak enough, and you get powerful to fast. That's why our own version gives everyone 6 levels as a 'common person' before becoming what most games would call level 1.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just weird (I actually am btw), and maybe I just had crazy luck with my tables (and I have, for real). I've gamed since 1980 though, with several dozen people regularly over the years, and these have been the prevailing opinions throughout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448722/#Comment_448722" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T14:52:39+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  2:52PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2015 2:53PM by Airk.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Compare these two:<br/><br/>A) At level n your thief skills will be x, y, z.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> At each level you earn m points to distribute between your thief skills.<br/><br/>The second is obviously more gamey, right?

That's why I've been making an effort to focus on the term "epic"; some similar clarity it regards to "gamist" character builds might be helpful, too. Rather than throwing out buzzwords, let's make an effort to explain what we actually mean, and I think this will go well.<br/><br/>Dave,<br/><br/>I think you nailed it.<br/><br/>Except for some of the early "starter" products (e.g. the D&amp;D materials which included just the first three levels), the basic concept behind the whole D&amp;D thing was the "zero to hero" arc.<br/><br/>So, naturally, especially for younger players, you wanted to get there as quickly as possible. Let's rule nations and become gods! I mean, the cover had a lone fighter up against a dragon. So of course you want to do that... but then you realize you'll need to be 20th level or something like that just to recreate this iconic image.<br/><br/>First edition had more wild, epic, mythical-scale stuff at the "top end" of this D&amp;D spectrum. (Consider, again, the monk's ability to "speak to anything" - animals, plants, perhaps even objects - and the "dim mak", which allowed you to kill someone with a touch - and even decide when exactly they would die - without a saving throw.) Second edition seems a little more linear and streamlined, more concise. More effort to maintain "balance", perhaps? (Less sure on this point.)<br/><br/>It's not surprising to me that "modern day" D&amp;D fans like to stay at the "bottom end" of the D&amp;D story arc, dealing with fragile anti-heroes in deadly dungeons. After all, we have better things for "Epic Roleplaying!" now, and (at least in my opinion - I'd love to hear a contrary opinion on this) D&amp;D's rules aren't a great fit for playing epic godlike beings who manipulate the political agendas of entire nations.<br/><br/><i>Also, I totally agree that the whole edition thing was not clear to an outsider who hadn't been there for the whole history of the hobby. I remember that when we started playing we had Basic, 1e, and 2e at the table, and mixed and matched whatever parts we liked. We didn't know that you were supposed to keep editions separate any more than you were supposed to keep, say, the Player's Handbook and the Monster Manual separate. (After all, with other books, new editions don't invalidate old editions, they just tend to have a nicer cover and fewer typos.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448737/#Comment_448737" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T21:44:15+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  9:44PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2015 9:50PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I suppose it matters rather you're inherently a narrator/creator, or inherently a gamer.

To me it's the ability to meta...to 'play the rules to skew probability or superimposed reality'.<br/><br/>While it's true that in reality thieves would vary specialization, in the game setting it results in min/maxing (they'll only dump points into the most likely advantageous) - which is the definition of the gamist to me. The more mechanically 'buildy' a game is, the more gamist it is for us. That makes 3rd the epitome of gamist games.<br/><br/>Now, you can do infinite builds in basic/1st ed too...but they're purely narrativist, not gamist, because there's no mechanical differences. Sadly both fail as simulation in that regard, but that's the tradeoff to avoid gaming.<br/><br/>I agree about the poor explanations, and yes, there was a section (at least up until 2nd) about game crossovers.

I was not aware of that.  Most of my friends have only partaken of the BE part of BECMI.  Do you recall when that stuff came out?  Was it all one package, or was it like, you purchase Basic and then later if you want you purchase Expert, and then C, M, etc.?  <br/><br/>If I'd picked up the whole package in my formative years, I'm sure my reaction would have been like yours.  Crazy high-level achievements were the first thing that gripped me about 2e.\n<blockquote>our biggest gripe about D&amp;D (every version, but least of all basic) has always been you don't start clueless/weak enough, and you get powerful to fast. That's why our own version gives everyone 6 levels as a 'common person' before becoming what most games would call level 1.<br/><br/></blockquote>Wait, what?  You dug the epic stuff, but demanded to slog through mundanity for a long time first?  Explain?</blockquote>\nKingdom level stuff was in the Expert rules (blue box of BECMI) I 'think'. If not there, then the Companion set (teal box). Either way it was early to mid 80s...83-84. Godhood was covered in the Immortal rules (gold box, about 1986 I think). That's how BECMI was set up...different box sets for each block of levels...basic-exper-companion-master-immortal (1-3, 4-14, 15-25, 26-36, 36+). <br/><br/>A far better presentation was the Rules Cyclopedia of course (1991). That's the basic that we've played ever since. Probably the single highest quality D&amp;D product ever produced.<br/><br/>We dug the epic scope because it was so grand and fantastic. Even at 1st level you were immersed in this INCREDIBLE environment. Reading the gazeteers for basic was like...I dunno...a 19th century person reading Edgar Rice Burroghs or 18th century one reading Verne. Just knowing what you MAY aspire to...*shudder*.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean we wanted to just be given superhero status however. When we wanted superheros from word go we played Marvel or DC. D&amp;D was the mythic narrative. Zero to Hero. How a common man becomes the stuff of legend. That requires not just effort, but logic.<br/><br/>If it isn't logical (at least to some degree) I can't suspend disbelief to enjoy it. That's why I'm a...realism gamer (trying to avoid the laden term simulationist here). Think of it this way:<br/><br/>In our world let's say someone dreamed of becoming the greatest woodworker of all time. First they'd need natural inclination, sure, but then it's all about training, experience and time. You have to spend quite a while (8-24 years) as a neophyte/novice before you even know what you want, and you're even ready to apprentice in your field. Then you have to spend years (historically 3-7) picking up the basics as an apprentice. After that you're a journeyman working for someone else, maybe forever, or if you have the drive and talent you might create a masterwork and become a master craftsperson. This could take any amount of time, and was dependent on finance and raw talent more than a set period. Some rare few might eventually rise to the status of Grandmaster after years/decades...the acknowledged best of their field (often only awarded posthumously).<br/><br/>So the breakdown of time spent is: long, medium, short-long (depending on talent/money), very long, forever - if you're the one.<br/><br/>If you're less tradesy you can apply that to academics:<br/><br/>Long time in primary/secondary school, medium time for undergrad, short-long for grad, very long for doctorate, and then world reknown if you're the one.<br/><br/>It's only reasonable to treat character leveling somewhat the same way. So in our version of D&amp;D there are 36 levels, broken into 6 tiers (novice, apprentice, journeyman*, expert*, master, grandmaster[i.e. immortal]) of 6 levels each. Experience and requirements to level vary by tier**. <br/><br/>* We split Journeyman and Expert both to get 6 tiers (because everything is 6 in our game) and to differentiate between someone on their own for the first time, and someone who is a master of their craft (an important, but missed distinction in previous games and our own reality actually).<br/><br/>**In BECMI it's split by number of levels: B-3 E-11, C-11, M-11, I-0 (in reality there's a huge time investment far exceeding a mere 11 levels, but it varies by class). However level gain is also on an increasing experience requirement, though experience awards likewise increase. The result is a short, long, longer, much longer, very long breakdown (or short, long, shorter, much shorter, very long where experience awarded exceeds the rate required to level) that defies the previously established logic. We could have merely adapted the level spread (to say, 5-2-3-5-8-13) but because the game changes mechanically by level, not by tier, it caused problems...not to mention being hard on ocd.<br/><br/>Now some people don't have any interest in the first tier. They want to start at the commonly established apprenticeship, not while still a 'classless' novice. No worries, go ahead. For us though, we think the story (and the mythic form) is better served  when we experience what leads us to our class apprenticeships and provides us our basic background skills.<br/><br/>Conan the Barbarian (original movie) doesn't start with him as a competent swordsman...it starts with him as a boy, becoming huge through hard labor, then apprenticing, then proving his worth, then striking out on his own, etc. It follows the form. Granted, it condenses the crap out of the first few tiers, but then that's Hollywood for ya.<br/><br/>This lets us be in an epic story, in a fantastical and epic setting, but spend considerably longer at the low-end of the power/ability spectrum...as a common man. It makes us more completely experience and earn what we may eventually attain, thereby appreciating it more and being a full story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448744/#Comment_448744" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T00:57:47+00:00" title="September 25, 2015 12:57AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2015 12:58AM by phoenix182.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448745/#Comment_448745" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T02:09:21+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  2:09AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2015 3:49AM by David_Berg.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

No role models, no kingdoms in need of kings... just bigger and badder stat blocks in Monster Manuals.<br/><br/>I take it the Basic gazetteers went well beyond this?<br/><br/>What are levels in a class system if not trade mastery? It's nothing more than getting better in your chosen craft, as an aggregate.<br/><br/>Anyone can learn to use a specific weapon, but no matter how good you get with a sword it doesn't make you a fighter (and certainly never a Fighter Lord). That's why in early D&amp;D you level classes and not skills (for the most part). It's just like any craft...you can practice all night and day with a hammer, but you're still not a carpenter.<br/><br/>I agree, and different groups will want to fast forward through different things. Our tables were highly detailed and realism oriented. I think what sold us on 1ed so hard was all the detail and realism elements (the things so many groups glossed over or ignored completely). Training, components, weapons vs armor, speed factors, encumbrance, economics, proper application of the hard and social sciences (as much as is possible in a fantasy game with a bunch of teens...even precocious ones), etc. Anyway, mere time was of no benefit to leveling. That was only achieved through some sort of experience, and experience was only gained for active play (even if was purely social play, or financial transactions to convert treasure to training and xp). <br/><br/>Our longest running campaign was several years real time...I wanna say four, but it could have been three or five. One to two was about average. That's playing 1-3 times a week, 4-8 hours per session. Then binge playing during the summer 3-5 days out of 7, as long as 12-14 hours a session. Mind you, we'd have many different games/campaigns going on at once, so that wasn't all focused on just one set of characters. <br/><br/>Using the rules as written I'd guess we made about 1-2 levels a month playing that way, so about half a year to name level and the start of kingdom crap, then another six months to truly epic play. That would last a few months til we finished or moved on to another campaign.<br/><br/>I played with a few different groups regularly. In general they were stable...out of say, 5 players 4 would stay the whole 1-2 years, some more like 6-12...we'd lose one to something, but almost immediately gain another. I still play with some of the same people I did in 1984 (still have many of the characters and original custom campaigns and notes too).<br/><br/>See, for us, it was ALL about that immersion, detail and realism. I usually DM'd, and I always figured if it was in a sourcebook it was meant to be used, so it should be worked into a campaign. Did you know the Greyhawk booklets had things like: immigration distribution, weather patterns, full descriptions of plants and animals by region, lunar phases, a fairly thorough almanac, heraldy, lineages, etc?<br/><br/>Using those details our campaigns left the realm of 'game' and usually rested fully in the creative narrative. Character creation took a day to a week, and sometimes resulted in novelette's for background. We're talking 60 typewritten pages, full literary treatments. It would include full family tree's, with motivations and traits, and explanation of probable life paths.<br/><br/>When we'd play equipment was described down to the last axe nick, belt loop and broken link. In any area description were environmental factors to show rather than tell, season, weather, flora, scents, sounds, political entities, economic trends, etc. NPC's didn't just have voice, they had full rational personality, and motivations, and connections.<br/><br/>What's more, any and all of that could often have full game impact if explored. We forced enough realism into the game that we had no choice but to truly PLAY our characters, and care more as a part of the story than a participant in a game. That's how the low level portions became so central to us...without them we'd have no personal connection by the later levels. No depth. No realism. Consider:<br/><br/>You made level 9, you can now build or conquer an 8 mile hex. When you do you'll attract 2d4 men at arms, and collect a yearly duty of 10d20 GP. What module do you want to do next?<br/><br/>Versus:<br/><br/>Why care about a kingdom toppling or being blighted? Butterflies of course. <br/><br/>It all started when your DM didn't mention the annual daisy blooms bringing swarms of furyondy butterflies, their gossamer wings every color of the rainbow turning the hills into rolling waves of scintillating and near unearthly beauty. For twelve months every time you traveled this road he made a point to mention them. You look forward to it, even if just subconsciously. <br/><br/>When the descriptions fail to mention the peels of laughter from children, chasing after them with the innocent abandon only they possess, you remember that one of them was Sirrah, the daughter of the cattle farmer near your brothers place (whom your nephew was very much smitten with). When you investigate and learn that she's now emaciated and sickly and desired by none, a result of the environmental and financial deterioration of the corrupt, possibly mad and definitely ineffectual baron your character reaches an epiphany. <br/><br/>All your glory hunting and treasure seeking, your skill with sword and bow and spell...meaningless. You remember in your youth how you wanted so badly to become an adventurer so that neither you, nor others among your friends and family, would be forced to toil ceaselessly merely to eek out an existence...susceptible to the whims of nature, the Gods, and those who name themselves your Lords and masters. You have abandoned them all, the ones you loved, who raised you and taught you, who sacrificed for you...you have abandoned yourself. <br/><br/>This land needs change - MUST change. You have the resources, but this will be a test unlike any that has come before. More fraught with peril than any nightshade infused blade wielded by a denizen of the great underdark is the political arena. <br/><br/>Your companions will stand with you, but they'll not be enough...not for this. Fortunately this was your home and you know the places and the people. You know how it was, and how it could be again. You will find the allies you need among these people, and you will save them. Then they can help you to fix what went wrong. All they need is a leader who is there for them...one of them. <br/><br/>You will win this fight, and just maybe then you will be worthy of remembering like you remembered all those stories your father would tell you and your brother. He never believed you when you said you could be just like the men in those stories. That all changes. Now.<br/><br/>You begin the quest for the gossamer rainbow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448751/#Comment_448751" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T09:07:13+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  9:07AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn.  Wish I'd been playing with you guys.  A lot of my D&amp;D gaming has had, like, a side order of everything you describe, but the focus has generally been on "beat this dungeon".  And I do like beating dungeons, but I like intense immersion and deep characters even more.  <br/><br/>The way I've found to connect the two is to put unique knowledge in my dungeons, which player characters can then employ to make themselves matter in broader and broader goings-on of the world.  <br/><br/>What was your connection?  I mean, I know the connection in game terms, but how did you fictionalize "crawl down hole, kill stuff, get loot" -&gt; "become influential"?<br/><br/>Sadly, I have no experience with the finer points of class-leveling in D&amp;D.  My groups were all about the gamey bits -- better THAC0, better saves, more hit points, etc.  I think 2e did mention something about land and followers at some point, but I honestly don't remember because it seemed irrelevant to our missions of crushing bigger and badder dungeons and critters and/or playing through GM plots.  Our GMs weren't looking to support influential PCs, only PCs with badass items and powers.  Blame the 2e DMG?  I dunno.<br/><br/>"If it's in a sourcebook, it should be worked into a campaign" sounds pretty important here.  That sounds like a tall order for folks like me who prefer making shit up from scratch or as inspired by whatever comic books I was reading at the time.  But if I'd actually read all that Greyhawk stuff, who knows, maybe I'd have gotten a different idea of the setting's role in play.  (I actually do own some of that Greyhawk stuff now!  I started reading about tree types... but found it way too boring to finish.  I would <i>love</i> to play with a GM who <i>did</i> get into that stuff, though...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448752/#Comment_448752" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T11:56:18+00:00" title="September 25, 2015 11:56AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you square 60 page backstories with having 2 hit points for six months?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448755/#Comment_448755" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T14:55:38+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  2:55PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2015 2:59PM by Airk.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I guess we're working from different definitions of 'gamey' is all. To me it's the ability to meta...to 'play the rules to skew probability or superimposed reality'.<br/><br/>While it's true that in reality thieves would vary specialization, in the game setting it results in min/maxing (they'll only dump points into the most likely advantageous)</blockquote>\nBut wouldn't thieves in the game world avoid spending time developing skills they didn't find useful? \n<blockquote><br/> - which is the definition of the gamist to me. The more mechanically 'buildy' a game is, the more gamist it is for us. That makes 3rd the epitome of gamist games.</blockquote>\nThis doesn't seem like a very useful definition to me. =/  Does this make GURPS the most gamey game out there?  This kindof hurts my brain, because it seems to me that these are ALSO the most realistic systems, and you assert you are realism centered.\n<blockquote><br/>Now, you can do infinite builds in basic/1st ed too...but they're purely narrativist, not gamist, because there's no mechanical differences. </blockquote>\nAt this point, I have no idea what you are saying =(<br/><br/>Honestly, I have a hard time imagining the game you describe, because it seems like it would take forever to do anything, not just get through the first few added levels.  And the amount of strain it would place on a GM sounds monstrous.  I'm singularly impressed you were able to make it happen.<br/><br/>On another note, my recollection of the actual content of the BECM sets (never bought Immortal) was that Basic was ALL about Dungeons.  Expert introduced the concept of "Overland adventures" and a little bit of the idea of "domains" or "land ownership" but very little about what to actually DO with them.  Companion and Master in my brain consist only of lists of higher level spells, magic items, and monsters, and I have no recollection at all of what they actually told you to DO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448756/#Comment_448756" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T16:42:25+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  4:42PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It wasn't until the Birthright Setting came along in 1995 that there was any real focus on domain play.

This kindof hurts my brain, because it seems to me that these are ALSO the most realistic systems, and you assert you are realism centered.</blockquote>\nYes, and as I said that's an example of the failure of accurate simulation within the framework. It's a tradeoff in this case. <br/><br/>In reality people specialize all the time. Some people will only major in something that will almost certainly make them money, validating (for them) what they spend on college. A thief dumping all his points into move silently and hide in shadows is roughly analogous. <br/><br/>Our problem arises when people do that BECAUSE they preconceive the game being about tactical combat advantage as opposed to story and character. THAT seems to be the purpose of most builditis (especially in 3rd). Consider:<br/><br/>If someone started playing with basic or 1st they wouldn't have the option. This would lead to a playstyle that didn't rely on inflated combat probabilities. People all know their abilities are roughly balanced, so will have to dynamically adjust their strategies to use the momentary modifiers as the triggers for what to do in order to 'play the mechanics'. <br/><br/>This is analogous to those of us that go to college for rounded educations and interests, and then dynamically adjust to opportunities around us. Renaissance mindset, which was prevailing pre 1700s (at least among the aristocracy, but even the common man had a version of it, if just for survival), and is therefore a better simulation in that regard anyway. <br/><br/>When people started playing with 2nd they are trained to seek the advantage. Now it comes down to experience. If they're in a group that plays as if it were 1st, they'll build to story, knowing that any skill may be valuable or workable. If they're in a group that kicks in doors and takes the treasure, they'll maximize their backstab potential (and maybe traps/locks). 3rd multiplied this mindset many times over, til many groups consider a non-optimized build unworkable and unwelcome in the party.<br/><br/>Gamists. (sorry, I can't think of another word for it)<br/><br/>This is also why we lump 2nd in with old-school. It made no difference to us in how we played, just gave us a bit more fine control, which got us closer to modern sim and therefore closer to our ideal. But taken alone I see that it's a different game.\n<blockquote>At this point, I have no idea what you are saying =( </blockquote>\nYeah, it really isn't 'builds' in that case. But this is what I was getting at:<br/><br/>If someone in 3rd (or GURPS, or whatever) has an idea for a character in the story and builds their character during creation to fit THAT, and not because of an attempt to 'outsmart the game' due to preconceived ideas of what challenges are faced more often, bravo. It's still more of a 'build' than someone without those options however, and is therefore inherently more gamey.<br/><br/>But we did that in basic and 1st too, we just didn't get actual mechanical benefit from it. It was all about background, narrative and choice.<br/><br/>Example: you're playing 2nd edition and I'm playing 1st. We both want to play a stealthy character that specializes in killing their opponents. Let's take it even further and assume this isn't because we're in a combat heavy group that we're trying to 'win', but instead just because it's part of an amazing backstory and how we want the ongoing story to evolve.<br/><br/>You make a thief, with focus on strength as well as dex, and you put most of your thief skill points into MS/HiS to maximize your backstab potential. You also spend your proficiencies to create a character who is mechanically adept at what you described.<br/><br/>I make an assassin, who has strength as a co-req anyway. My character is done, buildwise. However in the STORY I have the same background and inclinations as you. I'll play him the same, just without the mechanical advantage. <br/><br/>If we were at the same table (which doesn't work between editions, I know), obviously your character would do better at those aspects as a result of raw probability, but knowing I had limited probability I would be forced to 'play smarter', which would likely end up giving at least an equal result. Obviously if we were both playing that same style you would end up mechanically superior, at which point it comes down to intent (game or story).<br/><br/>So you have a 'build' (at least more of one), and I have a 'character in a story'. \n<blockquote><br/>Honestly, I have a hard time imagining the game you describe, because it seems like it would take forever to do anything, not just get through the first few added levels.  And the amount of strain it would place on a GM sounds monstrous.  I'm singularly impressed you were able to make it happen.<br/><br/>On another note, my recollection of the actual content of the BECM sets (never bought Immortal) was that Basic was ALL about Dungeons.  Expert introduced the concept of "Overland adventures" and a little bit of the idea of "domains" or "land ownership" but very little about what to actually DO with them.  Companion and Master in my brain consist only of lists of higher level spells, magic items, and monsters, and I have no recollection at all of what they actually told you to DO.</blockquote>\nOf course it takes a long time. It's roleplaying, it's supposed to. At least in our experience and preference. That's the ENTIRE reason we play it.<br/><br/>Of course GMs have to be monsters. That's why old-school GMs are metaphoric Gods (at least the good ones). It's not unusual for me to spend 10-20 hours prepping a single session, even today. That's after 40-100 hours creating the campaign framework. Even if we're playing from a pre-purchased module. That's my job in the game. If I don't do it, why play at all?<br/><br/>In general your recollection is mostly correct I think. But remember what I said before about 'if it's in a sourcebook it should be in the game'? The game had rules for creating and ruling a kingdom, therefore the game designers thought that was important, therefore it should be a fundamental part of a campaign. Like everything else in the game, we're only provided a bare framework (until later editions), and it's up to us to make it come to life through the narrative, not the game. Hence, the 'old-school experience'. <br/><br/>In basic there was limited direct info. Even in the Rules Cyclopedia it's only about 10 pages, and a few more for mass combat if that's a part of it. However there was also all the setting info, the gazeteers, Dragon articles, etc. In 1st you had *** the equivalents of all those other sources from basic. Even though it's sketchy, it's a fairly rich base to draw from, and even as a middle-schooler it was more than enough to get us to where we ended up.<br/><br/>***Sorry, just realized Castle guide was 2nd, not 1st. Now that I think of it I can't remember any sourcebooks just for domains in 1st. Will require more thought on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448764/#Comment_448764" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T21:21:14+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  9:21PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">@phoenix182</a>:<br/>(I will also echo the others who spoke of "high-level" adventuring in terms of ruling lands and vassals.

My bad.<br/><br/>Yeah, our homebrew is VERY different mechanically, so direct comparisons like that don't really work. The challenges faced in our first tier aren't as combat focused, and what combat there is isn't quite as swingy. On top of that characters begin a bit more rounded, with more 'before I was an adventurer' that's actually useful stuff to rely on.<br/><br/>I guess the closest comparison I can give is, think of 4th edition balance and setup but with the power (of the characters, and what they face) shifted down to what any common man in a village might have or do.<br/><br/>A common first tier encounter would be something like a remote farmhouse losing some livestock, and while the party is laying in wait thinking to trap a wolf instead it turns out to be a pair of emaciated and desperate goblins. In normal 1st or 2nd editions a single fighter should be able to take them by himself fairly reliably. In ours, it's a full party encounter, and even then they only stand a chance because the goblins are so weakened, and the party has (hopefully) done a LOT of preparation for ambushing and trapping the intruder.<br/><br/>Another example would be having to save a family member from disease. It would be mostly about finding the information for a cure, and foraging for (and then correctly preparing) the components for the cure. There's unlikely to be much fighting (just fear of the potential), and if there was it'd be against a common snake...roughly as dangerous as if you went hiking in the desert and found a small snake or scorpion. Some danger, but as long as you're smart you should be ok. Way better to avoid it however...unless it's bedded down in what you need for the cure of course.<br/><br/>Or perhaps it's near the end of the tier so the party is working on their leveling requirements to crest the tier. These are somewhat customized by character, so in this case the hunter's daughter (wanna be ranger) has to make a functional bow that's slightly too strong for her, break a green horse, pass a botany test, identify a single animal from a mess of tracks and track it to its lair, and bring down enough game to feed 4 people for a week. These aren't simply rolls, because we do things old school, so we expect the players to actually reason out what to do, research it beforehand, or at least pay enough attention to the clues given over the course of the first several levels to piece it all together. THEN they have to make their rolls.\n<blockquote>Your description of your campaign is pretty incredible. I didn't know anyone ever managed that kind of thing.

But then I think about the fact that of all the other groups I joined back then, and all the people who have come and gone from ours, these things seemed to be the norm for most of them. At least to a lesser degree.<br/><br/>I realize though that we really were weird. One of my early influences as a DM was a guy with three doctorates and four masters degrees (and a not-so-borderline personality disorder lol). The second group I joined as a player was all college students (I was 12 or 13). In my most regular high school group three had IQs above 150 (one graduated at 16, and was a doctor before he could legally drink). Most of us had unheard of leeway to stay out and pursue hobbies because of that, and I'm sure it's a big part of why we were so extreme. We were also all in the theatre program, and at that school it was nearly a semi-professional thing.<br/><br/>I also think it's important to remember that back then (late 70s, early 80s) these things weren't that unusual. At the start it wasn't that playing D&amp;D made you a geek, it was that geeks played D&amp;D (and almost no one else did). You could expect anyone at a game to be atypical.\n<blockquote>What were the challenges? Where did often go wrong? Where did problems arise, and how did you deal with them?<br/><br/>What areas of playing were unfulfilling or frustrating?<br/><br/>In short, what are the pitfalls of this kind of gaming.</blockquote>\nWell the biggest issue is always time commitment...both for prep and the ongoing campaign. Even character creation is an investment. We can't play now like we did then, though we do our best.<br/><br/>Sometimes you want something fast, or light, or gonzo. This doesn't work for that. That's one reason we usually have multiple games running we can switch to when people aren't feeling it.<br/><br/>This style also requires a lot more exposition, by the DM primarily, but also the players. That means people wait longer between spotlights. Takes pretty careful juggling to not focus too long on any one person, and to find ways each player can be a part of whatever the others are doing.<br/><br/>Finally I'd say it does take a certain type of person to get into. Detail oriented, strong focus and good retention, creative, confident but not too egocentric, and a bit of a renaissance man (or at least a good, fast learner/researcher).<br/><br/>One thing that's just come up recently (and I'm not sure it's a style issue so much as a personal one) is the in-person focus. We've tried doing distance games...skype, hangouts, etc. Never seems to work at all. It just utterly fails to reach immersion. There's something about being AT the table TOGETHER. No tech, no distractions. Any variance spoils something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448808/#Comment_448808" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T13:34:45+00:00" title="September 29, 2015  1:34PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I can't connect with this discussion at this point.

It can be made to feel somewhat more like one by running it using only the Basic PDFs and turning the gritty natural healing rules on, but even then it only kind of starts to feel like one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448817/#Comment_448817" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T20:25:59+00:00" title="September 29, 2015  8:25PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, wasn't trying to hijack, just responding to inquiries.

While some OSR games have a range of classes similar to 5e and have multi-classing (e.g., OSRIC and other AD&amp;D 1e clones), many have a much smaller range of classes, no multi-classing, and nothing like feats.<br/><br/>You can definitely play a game with similar constraints using the PHB by banning certain classes and no using feats or multi-classing. But in my experience thus far, the default assumptions for most 5e DMs and players are that what's in the PHB is fair game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448838/#Comment_448838" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-30T21:19:19+00:00" title="September 30, 2015  9:19PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2015 9:26PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for bringing us back to the original topic. That makes sense to me; I'm looking at the basic rules and it looks like a lot could handle OSR-style D&amp;D play. However, character creation is fairly involved (takes a long time, and presents too many different options) and creates "heroic" characters (e.g. the high default stats). 1st-level characters are definitely much more powerful than what most people in the OSR mindset deal with (a 1st-level character has many bonuses, high stats, enough hit points to take several blows, is well-equipped, and has access to many skills or spells - for example, a 1st-level wizard can cast a 1d10 damage Fire Bolt at will).<br/><br/>And that's all with just the basic rules (I can only imagine that using all the options in the Player's Handbook would allow players to find more optimal builds and options for their characters, boosting the level even futher).<br/><br/>So, 1st-level D&amp;D5 characters are definitely <i>heroes</i>, no question about it.<br/><br/>Interesting to look at all these little differences...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448839/#Comment_448839" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-01T02:34:34+00:00" title="October  1, 2015  2:34AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ehhhh, even a fully-optimized 1st-level character is no more than, say, 10% more resilient than one made from the Basic Rules.
