HarperCon wouldn't have come off if it wasn't for John Harper working his magic and getting us a free space to use all weekend long as late as we wanted.<br/><br/>Some highlights for me:<br/><br/>-My character sewing his eyes shut in Carl Rigney's DRYH game.<br/>-The creepy ghost ship crashing through the docks in Harper's D&amp;D 4ed game.<br/>-My character dropping his pants next to a highway overpass during my 'Election Day' hack of The Roach.<br/>-Finally getting to play my UFO role-playing poem 'The Believers' and watching the magic appear.<br/>-Having a supportive group help me design Seance on the fly and then playtesting it together!<br/>-Screaming out the lyrics from 'Highway Star' while playing Rock Band with my fellow "Nordic Track" players. <br/>-Good times and fun conversation during every yummy meal.<br/>-Being wise enough to invite Matthew Klein to fly up to Seattle.<br/><br/>So happy that this all came together.

Friday evening we had dinner at Wann Izakaya and then moved down the street for dessert and John Harper told us about the glory of Time Belt and Yacht Rock.<br/><br/>Saturday morning Ogre finally got to play <em>Don't Rest Your Head</em> (having always GMed before); I ran for him, Charlie S, Lukas, and Chris B.  The PCs devasted the clockwork forces, Ogre's Japanese-Swiss jetsetter party organizer deferred a wish from the Wax King to declare herself the Mad City's protector, aided by Charlie's PC, and Lukas' PC used his wish to bring his dead lover back, but earlier had traded away true love, so it was both touching and sad.  And the PCs obtained the First Knife (the one Cain killed Abel with, the source of all murder) and gave it to someone who'll find a good use for it, I'm sure.<br/><br/>After lunch I ran DRYH again, this time for Matthew (who also flew up from Oakland), Brandon,<br/>Ben R, and John A, in which John's PC traded his friends for a second chance, Brandon's WoW Addict (madness power: overlay WoW on the real world) traded a friend's heart for his son's escape from the High School, and the final scene in the doorway of the Math Class of the Damned was bursting with mad treachery,  skullcrushing, heartstabbing, and a pop final in pajamas no one had studied for.  There was body swapping (just once), and a madness talent of "others suffer in my place".  There was an uncredited cameo by Ryan M's "M is for Mathemagician" PC from last week's run.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't enough mad fun, after dinner at a nice Italian place that forgot that blue cheese contains cheese, I ran <a href="http://www.flick.com/~cdr/rpg/rock/" rel="nofollow">Rock n Roll Dreams</a> (Brand Robins' Jim Steinman: The RPG using Vincent's <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> rules and Graham Walsley's Meatloaf LARP "Too Much Rock for One Hand" scenario, combined into a chimera of rock emo porn) for Ogre, Jordan, and Jordan's almost-14 year old son Ian.  Ogre was Bo "Drifter" Duffy, who died face down in the mud gunned down by the father whose daughter he'd failed to save.  Ian played Papa Jailer, leader of the Infernal Bitches biker gang, who won the race last year but chose to live instead of win again.  Jordan played Mickey "King Curve" Carlson, who won the race and got the girl and never looked back.  The scenario worked better for 4 players than 3 so I have some retuning to do, but fun was had and awesome was brought to that lonely road from a dive bar outside a godforsaken town under the full moon on a hot summer night. In a thunderstorm.<br/><br/>At midnight Chris B &amp; Matthew &amp; I stagged back to our very conveniently located hotel a block away, and discussed their Election Roach results (detailed elsewhere) and Matthew's impressions of the con since he's relatively new to indie gaming and has an interesting fresh perspective.<br/><br/>Sunday morning's slot was only 3 hours so I ran <em>Lacuna Part 1, The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City (second attempt)</em> for Mickey, Lukas, and John Harper.  Agents Coleman and Piper accomplished Primary <em>and</em> secondary missions, but Mickey's Agent Kellogg ate a bullet to avoid capture.  Final heartrates were 224 (or 0), 207, 183.  I hope Mills and Katrina show up again.<br/><br/>I was fairly crispy after running 4 games in 27 hours so I declined Ben Robbin's offer to play <em>3:16 Carnage to the Stars</em> but I greatly enjoyed watching it, and I bought a bundled copy from IPR as soon as I got home.  Earth's best last hope is that John Harper's Sgt Cabral (Lt Cabral by the time I had to leave for the airport) makes it all the way to Brigadier someday.<br/><br/>I also did a 5-minute interview with Ogre for his Stabbing Contest.  And then we bay area folk zoomed off to the airport to return from the land of two-day minicons to the land of one-day minicons, and to find an evil offer from Travelocity pointing out $150 airfares to Seattle.<br/><br/>Many thanks to John H and PBJS for hosting, to Chris B for getting it rolling, and to the 20 or so people who showed up and brought their A game.

Alan B's sudden reveal of Fake Toten Sar was, in a nutshell, why these hippie games are fun for me.  It was one of those great story-moments that was both completely surprising and absolutely right.<br/><br/>In retrospect I worry that the big T-S might have de-emphasized the diplomatic summit at the heart of the game and knocked a big chunk out of some characters' stories, tho.<br/><br/>Thanks to John H. for being our training wheels -- IAWA is a subtle game, rewarding procedure.<br/><br/>Slot 2 was Carl's <b>Don't Rest Your Head.</b>  I fumbled with this one a bit.  I played it like I had to hustle my character towards their premise and problem at all times -- but the game was not one of those, it was much more GM-driven.  Once I relaxed, let the drugs kick in and stopped trying to fight my way through the scenario, I enjoyed it.  Neatest thing happened about 2/3 of the way through, when I think we realized we didn't have quite enough backstory in the group for the game to really cook.   So we activated story gamer powers, invented some, and carried on to a tight finale.  Also, Ben Robbins can call on a badass god complex when he needs to.<br/><br/>Slot 2.5: <b>IAWA</b>, with Jordan and Ian.  Jordan's a dark sorceress.  Ian is the reincarnation of an ancient sage, being held back by his adoptive father.  Jordan wants to harvest Ian's brain.  Ian wants more power.  Ian gets more power.  Jordan decides to hold off on the harvesting until the crop is ready, but only Ian is on the owe list...<br/><br/>Slot 3 was Chris B's <b>Election Roach</b>.  <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7142" rel="nofollow">Roaches up, pants down.</a><br/><br/>Slot 4 was <b>Carry</b>.  I've always been attracted to this, and Ogre took it for a spin for Jordan, Ian, and me.  The game system is pretty intriguing, though the game's use of pregenerated characters felt like not the good kind of constraint to me.  We got a story with a typical me-ending out of it; despite my Sgt's best intentions and tireless work, shit got fucked up, badly.  I definitely want to try it again sometime.<br/><br/>Slot 5 was Chapter 2 of the <b>IAWA from 2.5,</b>  with Phil, Jordan, and Ian.  After this game, I want to make IAWA a mixtape full of power ballads.  This one nicely demonstrated the workings of We Owe -- Jordan burned both his entries on freezing the entire world into endless hibernation and succeeded utterly, vanquishing Ian's reincarnated sorceror, Phil's heirloom magic sword, and the NPC smoke demon Baron Tar.  But now his story is told and done, while the others will be returned to someday.<br/><br/>It was a terrific weekend. Thanks to Chris for being the spark, to Ogre for being the bartender, to Jackson and Brendan for being great guests, and especially especially to John H for doing the hard work on the ground.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159260/#Comment_159260" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T22:31:06+00:00" title="July 28, 2008 10:31PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This weekend was a bases-loaded home run firework show game-winning touchdown overtime winner of awesome.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone for showing up, gaming hard, being excellent to each other, and treating the venue with so much respect.

I mentioned <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=NLlGopyXT_g" rel="nofollow">Web 2.0 ... The Machine is Us/ing Us</a> to Ben Robbins as the best explanation of Web 2.0 I've seen.  I also recommend <a href="http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html" rel="nofollow">Clay Shirky's 2008 talk on Here Comes Everybody</a> and his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/1594201536/" rel="nofollow"><em>Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations</em></a>.<br/><br/>For an example of a future where the ability to find interesting things to bring to other people's attentions is the only real currency, read Scott Westerfeld's <em>Extras</em> but since it's the fourth book in the series, first read <em>Uglies</em>, <em>Pretties</em>, and <em>Specials</em>.  Everything else by Westerfeld is exceptionally good too, but especially his Midnighters Trilogy: <em>The Secret Hour</em>, <em>Touching Darkness</em>, <em>Blue Noon</em>, and his creepily fascinating book about vampires and parasites: <em>Peeps</em>.  You'll never look at cats the same way again.<br/><br/>John Harper pointed out <a href="http://www.channel101.com/" rel="nofollow">Channel 101</a>'s 5-minute shows, especially <b>Time Belt</b> and <b>Yacht Rock</b>.  I've only watched the first episode of Time Belt, and I'm hooked.<br/><br/>Lots of TV series got recommended around; my contribution was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Complete-Matt-Reeves/dp/B0007N1AM2/" rel="nofollow"><em>Miracles</em></a>, a 2002-2003 series which only showed six episodes before the war pre-empted it. The DVD includes seven unaired episodes as well.  Episode 2, "The Friendly Skies", was enough to convince me to buy it.<br/><br/>Also, the 6-episode BBC series <em>Ultraviolet</em>, not to be confused with the movie of the same name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160284/#Comment_160284" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-01T15:06:45+00:00" title="August  1, 2008  3:06PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brendanadkins/sets/72157606487226786/" rel="nofollow">My photos exist!</a>  I also got a shot of the quote board, transcribed below:<br/><br/>Jackson, to Chris:  "How would you feel about having a lot of acid on you?"<br/><br/>John:  "Well, I'm on fire, cursed, and marked, but at least I'm not covered in acid! ...AUGH"<br/><br/>Ian:  "... in the FACE!"<br/><br/>Jackson, re: the Flame of Vecna:  "In a minute here we're gonna cut him open and find out how old he is."<br/>Brendan:  "Yeah, count the rings of fire."<br/><br/>Jordan:  "Ain't nothin' like graveyard lovin'."<br/><br/>Matthew:  "I have a notoriously strong bladder."<br/><br/>Sgt.
