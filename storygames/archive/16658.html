You could list all the options one game gives to a particular kind of character and determine the level of impact each option has on the setting. I'm pretty sure it could even help designers find a more proper balance between classes.<br/><br/>There's a couple of points about this theory I haven't touched yet but I can elaborate if you ask. But so far I've got a few questions regarding this:<br/><br/>-Do you know of any game/mechanic/philosophy/theory similar, older, better, already tried, tested and dropped?<br/>-Does it sound totally off base for some reason?<br/>-Is there something really important I'm missing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381053/#Comment_381053" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T14:25:27+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  2:25PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smallville is the only "mandatory" motivation-based mechanic that I know about.

It's how you put together a script, according to the how-to-put-together-a-script books I've been reading.<br/>\nUsing formula is a pretty good model for putting a game structure together. I love mixing genre formulas with game mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know of any game mechanics that have been tried-tested-and-dropped in this regard because so few game mechanics are dropped at all in this community. If there's a way to make it work, someone's probably made a game using it as a mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only place you're off base is in thinking that you need to list all the different options as anything other than suggestions or guidelines - cards to put into a slot.<br/>\nUnless you want to make each suggestion a card with special powers and its own method of modifying the rules, thus creating a CCG story game, which is fine by me if you got the money to put art on the cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, worrying about balancing classes is kind of a moot point if you go down the road you seem to be suggesting, here. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you focus on the formula of, say, a good action-adventure movie, then all the stats, the equipment, etc. become window-dressing or, at best, resources in the game's economy. The limitation of what a character can have no longer becomes class (their background) but what stage of the storyline they've reached (which you can log by making Motivation more dynamic.) Since a change to motivation is the simplest and easiest-to-recognize change to a character (and change to a character is a hallmark of a satisfying story) then what you want to do is examine how motivations change at different points in the act structure of the kind of story you want to emulate.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's do action-adventure here as an example, again. Heroes in these things tend to go through three distinct motivational phases: Reluctance, Impotence and Awakening - though Impotence may be a bad word to use there.<br/>\n<br/>\nReluctant characters usually have more protections than other characters and a lot of unfilled slots, with a high potential for adding more cool stuff as they go along.<br/>\nImpotent characters have reached the point where they are facing impossible odds, have just been smacked down (brought to zero HP?) or otherwise seem unable to go any further. They tend to have very low defense and unpredictable offense. They are also usually in a position where they will have to expend a considerable amount of resources to turn things around.<br/>\nLastly, during awakening, characters have awesome attack skills and maybe moderate defense skills (this is the best time for a heroic character to die.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381104/#Comment_381104" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T22:23:09+00:00" title="June  6, 2012 10:23PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JD">@JD</a>, yes Smallville is a good exampl for the motivation part, though I wouldn't use motivations for everything... not that it's wrong, it fits Smallville perfectly since it isn't a game about using your superpowers to kick the crap out of the fiction - it's a game about the consequences of using those powers. But I still want to try this into the old heartbreaker setting to see if it works, and then go fo different things with it. Not that it's a flexible system, but I think it may be a good base for a lot of different things. So let's say, from all the "resources" your character has available, only three are connected to other elements in the fiction. And I wouldn't use them all the time but only in some the scenes that really count.<br/><br/>I tried Aspects but having players push the "more trouble" button for karma points takes away some of the fun in it. Well at least it ruins a bit of the inmersion and narrative rythm. Perhaps that's just my players. And though I had the chance to read Mouse Guard a couple of times, I couldn't get an intuitive way of playing the beliefs, at least not with my group of players. I'll try and give it another read anyway. Thanks a lot!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Keith">@Keith</a>, many thanks, let's hope this actually leads somewhere!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Arpie">@Arpie</a> whooooa ok, you've got something interesting there. I'm not going that heavy into the dramatics and storytelling, I'm thinking of a game somewhat gamist but simple that produces an story as a byproduct. So far it feels like a curious little machine you can feed with crap, push buttons at random and get something coherent without too much prep and relying in players not for creativity but for interpretation of the output of the game's procedures. Of course, you always play with some intent, I'm just trying to make it easier to build narrative momentum. Once you've got enough you can kick the rules and take the story wherever feels more exciting, but the beggining is crucial. And the faster, the better.<br/><br/>Now, about listing each resource, I was thinking of that as a method to find if different characters in a game are balanced respect each other and the setting. I'm out of time today but I'll try to apply this to my pathfinder monk PC. For my design it's a different story, I'm using a shorter list of more general "resources" that can be combined to perform different actions. Thus I'm not using cards to list all the player's resources, but to help players/GM create and populate the setting as they advance through it, and frame scenes and challenges to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>However your idea looks pretty cool. You'll need a way to push players out of each step, preferrably one that doesn't include railroading, either by some particular procedure, a sort of pool of tokens of any king that once exausted triggers the next phase of the character. For example, a PC on the reluctant phase could have a pool of "excuses" that once exausted bring the character into action. Then it's replenished as a pool of "suffering" that allows the PC to get through the hardship of training scenes and early battles. Once exausted it triggers the Awakening and the pool is replenished now with "Hero" points, that allow the PC go beyond it's limits at the cost of its life, if the player spends it all. Hmm, I'll think more about this, thanks for the help!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381107/#Comment_381107" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T22:32:06+00:00" title="June  6, 2012 10:32PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>I tried Aspects but having players push the "more trouble" button for karma points takes away some of the fun in it.

Now, of course you can always turn the tables on that, but the fact that aspects are more a meta-game to the group right now won't change that easily. Unless I find other way of using them that has less impact on the so-called "Inmersion"<br/><br/>Anyway, let me add another layer of complexity to the theory, using inspiration from AW basic moves:<br/><br/><br/>An RPG character can be reduced to:<br/><br/>-the character's reasons to interact with the setting in a particular way.<br/>-the options it gives the players to interact with the fiction. There are 7 types of options:<br/><br/>ATTACK options. Anything that deals with harming or destroying fictional elements goes here.<br/>PROTECT options. Anything meant to protect the status quo of an element of the fiction goes here.<br/>MOVEMENT options. Anything dealing with changing the fictional location of the character and obtaining some sort of advantage from it goes here.<br/>DISCOVERY options. Anything that adds information to the fiction goes here.<br/>SOCIAL options. Anything that deals with the PC obtaining any advantage from social interaction goes here.<br/>AID / INTERFERE - here goes anything that witouth having a direct effect on any element in the fiction, imposes advantages or disadvantages to the rest of the options of the player and/or other characters.<br/>RESOURCE CREATING options. - finally, these deal with anything that give the PC new options under determined circunstances. Money to buy equipment (needs the vecinity of a store) skills for crafting (needs the presence of materials, time, tools, etc) xp used to learn new skills, etc.<br/><br/>Of course, there are a lot of options that are a mix of two or more. Empathy as a skill is a SOCIAL option used for DISCOVERY of new information. When empathy is used to gain an ally, it becomes a resource creating option. Invisibility is a PROTECT option that can be used as an AID to gain advantage over an opponent. But somehow I still can't think of something that could be completely out from these types of options (hey let me know if you can see something I'm missing here)<br/><br/>So, to know the full range of options an specific character has available, list them all under these categories, repeating the options that can be used in more than one category (like, say, the "Channel Energy" feature from Pathfinder's Cleric, which can both heal and harm undead) determine the level of impact it has on the setting on a 1-10 scale and then you'll have a more accurate way to determine if an specific character is balanced. Well, at least that's the idea. What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381313/#Comment_381313" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T17:29:42+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  5:29PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi WM.

I used the less generalized categories to allow some tactical choices for the player and assign one size of dice to each category. So, heartbraker-wise, you could have a better balance between a monk and a fighter, a fighter and a wizard, etc. without leaving one of them with less-powerful, less interesting or with less options. This could also make ALL skills usable in different situations, allowing to mix two different kind of actions.<br/><br/>Say, you have a fighter with a d20 on ATTACK and a d4 in SOCIAL. In a battle he could mix the two stating that he taunts the enemy with whatever one-liner comes to the players head. In a -certain- social situation he could roll the two dice again to intimidate another character. It still doesn't make the bard and fighter the same (on all mixes that have SOCIAL options the bard with have advantage, while only in the specific case of ATTACK+SOCIAL the fighter will have some edge)<br/><br/>About MOVEMENT, it could include options like Horse, Stealth, Teleporting, Acrobatics, (or a stealthy acrobatic teleporting horse if you want) etc. so I'm not sure POSITIONING describes enough what kind of options go here (but correct me if I'm wrong, my english isn`t too good)<br/><br/>Now, PROTECT gave me some doubts. When it represents protecting others it's always an action, but when it represents a resource that only protects you, like an armor, is more of a passive resource, therefore it doesn't make much sense to roll for defense with it. Perhaps just in that case there wouldn't be a dice but an static number between 2 and 15 that would only decrease when the armor is damaged by an attack that beats it's protection. Oh, protect would also include magical healing, limited quick regeneration, etc. But in case you're mixing PROTECT and MOVEMENT you could state your character trusts his armor and runs trough a group of enemies. Then you just roll the MOVEMENT dice and keep the higher result (either the movement roll or the Armor stat) and compare to the enemy attack roll to determine the result. Perhaps it could still be included into the aid/interfere category so thanks a lot for your input!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381480/#Comment_381480" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T14:35:24+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  2:35PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at Dogs in the Vineyard, which does more or less what you're talking about in the OP, if I understand you correctly.<br/><br/>You might be Shooting (so you'd roll in Acuity 3d6 + Will 2d6), and make a case that you could use your trait, "Learned how to shoot from the best" 2d8, and also bring in your "big, excellent shotgun" 2d8+1d4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381729/#Comment_381729" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T13:21:37+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  1:21PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2012 1:22PM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I took a few things from Dogs in the Vineyard, except that I simplified it first by using just one dice for each type of action, and added a bit of tactical complexity by allowing players two actions on their turn.<br/><br/>So in this system you would be using 1d20 to shoot with your "big, excellent shotgun" while running across the room with your 1d12 "wolf steps". And if you have "learned how to shoot from the best" associated to your attack, roleplay it into your descrption and you could roll 2d20 instead of one. That makes 2d20 and 1d12. Take the highest and compare to the difficulty or the opponent highest dice. If you pass, you succeed at both. If you tie, you succeed at one, if you lose, you can't do neither.<br/><br/>I'm also using stakes from DitV, but in a different way. It's not up to the active player to state what's at risk. Instead, any of the rest of the players can pay one token and call for a "Hunch", stating what's the worst or best that could happen, before the player's roll.<br/><br/>In the previous example, When the player is about to roll, another player pays one token and says, still in character: "come on, don't trip, don't trip, you can make it..."<br/>If the roll fails, the player who called for a hunch earns one token, However the player who failed the roll can still pay one token to state that his character trips but somehow manages to roll behind a barrel...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
