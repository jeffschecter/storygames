Now there are lots of games out there to do with zombies. I found <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/5040/sell-me-on-a-game-for-zombie-survival-horror/p1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> already, but the OP is asking after something different from me - and it's from 7 years ago.<br/><br/>The things that attract me to the zombie apocalypse are two-fold: First, the tight band of survivors and their relationships and emotions: How do they deal with their world falling apart? What happens when Joe gets bitten - will Karen kill him before he turns? Will they keep hoping or give in to despair? Will love blossom in the ashes of the dying world?<br/><br/>Secondly, the challenge of survival: How will they navigate this dangerous wasteland? How will they fort up and survive the night? How will they scout the wilderness? How to balance the need for more food with the risks in retrieving it?<br/><br/>So is there a game that give me both of these, or is this a recipe for classic non-functional gameplay - trying to mix the gamism with the narrativism? What game would you suggest?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000" title="johnthedm7000"><img alt="johnthedm7000" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">johnthedm7000</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434164/#Comment_434164" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T22:27:20+00:00" title="June 21, 2014 10:27PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...off the top of my head there's Fate which could easily be hacked for zombie-apocalypse style play and that does drama-focused campaigns very very well although it's not necessarily focused on the nitty-gritty minutiae of survival. All Flesh Must Be Eaten has the genre and survival focus you're looking for, but doesn't put much emphasis on the relationships/hard decision making side of things so it'd be up for the group to add that in. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Apocalypse World, which has had a number of good zombie hacks/custom moves come out for it in recent years and even if you can't track them down on Barf Forth Apocalyptica, it's easy enough to add that sort of stuff in on your own. <br/><br/>There is also a game I've been working on for the past couple of years that's gotten some good press here and on rpgnet called Fear The Living that was designed specifically for that sort of relationship-focused play with lots of hard choices and opportunities for betrayal. I'll cut the shameless self promotion short though, and just let you judge for yourself if it's what you're looking for: <br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B97VUsWnBKEtWjJ4VEZFTjVlMWM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">The Playtest Document</a><br/><a href="http://https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B97VUsWnBKEtejdlRmVoTXQtMFk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><br/>Survivor Character Sheet</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434165/#Comment_434165" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T23:21:56+00:00" title="June 21, 2014 11:21PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go with any flexible drama-oriented adventure game: there are a lot of options out there, and what you describe is specifically what they offer, that combination of organic setting and dramatic focus. <i>Solar System</i> is my own first choice for this sort of thing, but the usual suspects all might work for different nuances and personal needs - FATE, Burning Wheel (not the most flexible, admittedly, but an expert could do it), Heroquest, Apocalypse World... I don't think that any of these have an off-the-shelf zombie setting sourcebook, though.<br/><br/>Also no need to ignore <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, it'll do all this with a rules-light chassis, assuming the group is on the same page about treating the dystopic challenges seriously instead of making it a pure soap opera drama. The issue is basically whether the group will bring the survivalism-themed setting detail themselves; if they do, then PTA (and of course its zombie-specific movie-length nephew, <i>Zombie Cinema</i>) will work just fine. It won't be players worrying about wound fever, but rather the players telling stories about characters who worry about wound fever. As long as you actually want the wound fever, you can have it, it's just that the game won't tell you when it strikes.<br/><br/>Analogously to using a drama game and bringing the harsh survival content yourself, you could of course use any non-dramatic adventure game chassis and bring the drama. That's actually the trad gaming recipe for dramatic games - I've been reading a lot of '90s-'00s trad games for various reasons recently, and they all basically want really hard to be drama games, but their recipe always boils down to that one thing: here's some skill-resolution rules, and lets all (particularly the GM) just play dramatic moves instead of lame ones. Evidently that's just right for some groups. I hear that <i>All Flesh Must Be Eaten</i> is the king of trad style zombie games.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment"

<br/><br/>Specifically, the chapters would be about the moments when tensions flare and people are at each others' throats: no wasting time describing how people hide for six months in an abandoned mining complex, but we'd skip straight to the moment when the zombies find a way in and the survivors realize that there's only space for two of them in the boat.<br/><br/>It would all be told out of order, of course, where you find out a certain character's past only after learning how they die, and that kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

can't help with that, but I will say that when Smallville was still in print, my group did a dynamite character/setting creation for a zombie apocalypse game (that we sadly didn't actually play).  The Cortex+ Drama method of making relationship dynamics a part of every die roll did an amazing job of getting us to think in that Romero mode where the zombies are more an environmental threat and proximate cause of death-- in-fighting with other humans is always what fucks things up.  <br/><br/>Two other advantages we saw were the conflict-resolution rules allowing for finer granularity in physical combat (that is, you could "take damage" from escaping zombies by being exhausted or stressed out instead of a binary between "totally uninjured" and "bitten"), and in theory, if any of the PCs got turned they could tack on some zombie Abilities and keep on playing.  Their huge Relationship dice with the other PCs also supports the zombie-movie tendency towards irony; it's often a dead relative or lover who ends up killing you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434324/#Comment_434324" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T23:48:47+00:00" title="June 24, 2014 11:48PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The things that attract me to the zombie apocalypse are two-fold: First, the tight band of survivors and their relationships and emotions: How do they deal with their world falling apart?

What game would you suggest?</blockquote>\nI have a standard answer here, but first ... a question:<br/><br/>How do you see the first thing actually playing out in the context of actual gameplay? Do you want actual manifest hard mechanics that describe relationships with quantized numbers on how they change and with players pushed by conflict resolutions to act in different ways than they would otherwise choose? That's a big deal question -- and my personal preference is not to go that way unless that's specifically what the game is about. If it's about relationships and pushed dynamics, then that's what it needs to be <i>about</i> and pulling in the tactical issues is going to be a hard sell unless the tactical aspects are built off of the relationship drive mechanics. That's a very different kind of game.<br/><br/>As much as I love PTA and the like which hinge on intercharacter drives, they don't really provide me the kind of tactical feedback that makes "choice of tactics" satisfying. Sort of like trying to run a <b>Phoenix Command</b> scenario with <b>Capes</b> -- they do very, very different things.<br/><br/>Pretty much my solid go-to for zombie game environments that really hinge on tactics is <b><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/all-things-zombie.html" rel="nofollow">All Things Zombie</a></b> from Two-Hour Wargames, which explicitly focuses on tactical situations and leaves issues of intercharacter narrative either unmechanized (between PCs, largely) or in a fortune-at-the-beginning kind of "resolve then play it out way" when dealing with NPC individuals and groups. It works for conveying the kind of survivalist zombie horror that I consider some of the best kinds of zed fests, where the zombie apocalypse is an environmental threat as much as a tactical one.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434341/#Comment_434341" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T06:47:12+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  6:47AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thread you might find useful:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15487/the-walking-dead/p1" rel="nofollow">Gaming the Walking Dead</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434348/#Comment_434348" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T07:53:49+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  7:53AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.
