He gives me game ideas. He walks into my office while I'm working and just starts talking. I usually write down what he says as he speaks. Then, when he's finished telling me about whatever it is that's on his mind, he goes back to his toys.<br/><br/>These are a few of his ideas, which I have typed up verbatim. I will be using some of these ideas in an upcoming RPG session.<br/><br/><div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><br/><br/>There's a good robot with a medical gun that when you shoot at people, it makes them come alive if they are dead. He also has a laser finder that is an invisible point with a ball that spins around and it makes a beeping sound, and it makes a trail so that if something is lost it can find its way back.<br/><br/>I know a dragon that is a 4,000-headed fire-breather. He likes nothing. He wants to eat people, because then he gets a new head for each person he eats. The point is, if a dragon has zero heads, then he has a tiny hole that sucks up a person, and then a head grows. Then, he eats another person, and has two heads. It lives in a cave called Doomsdale.<br/><br/>Fushardy is the Jedi planet. The red dots of Fushardy are actually giant big circle-shaped aliens that roll on it for 75 million billion trillion days. And when the aliens are not rolling, they go to the mushy mud pit, which is where they take a bath. And then they shrink to ant-size and then they roll in chewing gum which has been spat on the concrete. People don't see them. And if they step on them, the aliens have teeny-tiny rattles, but they make a loud sound. And then the people know not to step on them anymore. <br/><br/>Dofosco is the Droid planet. There is a green warty alien who has tentacles and he has fangs. He likes to drink blood at doomsday. He slimes other houses and maybe he will slime the entire planet. And his name is Slime. There is billions and billions of these slime-warty ones. And then on Valentine's Day, they take away the gifts, for real. And then they eat all the candy that other children had.<br/><br/>There's a giant monster that destroys cities, but it's actually nice. It only destroys bad guy cities. The nice monster draws nice pictures for good guys and awful horrible pictures for bad guys.<br/><br/>There is a superhero called Ultra Sword Boy; he is a little green guy and his feet are blackish-green, and he has this biiiiiiiiiiiiiiig sword that can chop up any monster. Ultra Sword Boy wants to kill all the bad guys and make new friends. Every time he makes a friend, then they will become an Ultra Sword Boy or Girl and they will help fight monsters, but will not turn evil.<br/><br/>The bad guy is a giant man-eating snail with a hundred eyes, and it has a shell that's about a thousand feet, and it travels seventy miles per hour. It has razor-sharp teeth, and it takes the snail forty hours to digest you. The snail is afraid of cute noises. Like if you meow, it will run away and say AAAAHH.<br/><br/>There is a solar system called Our Solar System, and it has planets named Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Mercury has drillbots that look like robots with drill-hands. Venus has venus flytraps that are as big as two dads stacked up on top of each other, because the plant name has the word Venus in it. There's also some bugs on Venus called Flarmarjans, Beedrills, and Beetleroniums, and the flytraps eat those bugs. The Flarmarjans just buzz and fly around. The Beedrill has a drill antenna that spins around, and if a flytrap eats one, it will not do anything to it. Beetleroniums are giant beetles that are as big as a dresser, and they make a snorting sound. A venus flytrap eats 7.5 meals per minute. On Mars, there are giant craters that have giant wormlike plants that are invisible, and also some plants that kind of look like a person, but they have a giant flytrap mouth, and they do have clothes on. They are called Fedrantimocleras. Jupiter is the cutest planet, because it has one big red eye and it watches over you. It's actually a storm, so if you go to Jupiter, beware. On Jupiter, if you put something on the eye, like lemon juice, it disturbs Jupiter. Everybody says that Saturn is the beautifulest planet, because he is the jewel of the solar system because he has pretty rings. Uranus has a twin brother, named Neptune. They have a similar size and color. Pluto is a dwarf planet. Not everybody thinks that Pluto is a planet, but it is. There is nothing on Pluto but icebergs and giant spiders that crawl, make webs, and do the usual spider stuff. Now let's talk about the Earth's moon, which nobody knows about but me. There are giant aliens on the moon. They have forty eyes and twenty mouths so they can talk and chew at the same time and stick out 18 tongues. They like to do art. They make beautiful art that's more beautiful than a ballerina.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379335/#Comment_379335" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T15:44:14+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  3:44PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2012 3:46PM by DeBracy.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I grow up, I want to be an Ultra Sword Boy or Girl and go on a quest to Doomsdale.<br/><br/>Fetus rocks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379339/#Comment_379339" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T15:50:34+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  3:50PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He's got some serious ideas (he wrote Spite, actually).<br/><br/>But I'm thinking -- kids have no restraint. When I play or GM, I definitely try to tap into that free-flowing lava-wave of associations and madcap combinations ("Doomsdale"), but often, I succumb to impediments. For example, I worry that something is too gonzo or inappropriate, or that random bursts of ideas don't necessarily cohere.<br/><br/>It's a bit like trying to assemble a creative product (a movie, a book, an RPG) from a brainstorming session -- usually, that doesn't work. Instead, you take the materials from the brainstorm and you assemble, refine, polish, and eventually publish.<br/><br/>What I've learned from Fetus is that sometimes, if you just give into that berserker id, and let the freakshow roll through, you sometimes get bananas covered in the napalm of glory, which is kind of special.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379373/#Comment_379373" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T18:47:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  6:47PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>He likes to drink blood at doomsday.</blockquote>\nLike father, like son.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379423/#Comment_379423" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T04:43:51+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  4:43AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rotten apple doesn't fall far from the barrel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
