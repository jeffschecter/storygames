Underground tomb left by previous visitors to the planet kind of stuff. If you've not read or played 7th Sea, it has some alien tech in it.<br/><br/>Anyway. My buddy Mike and I would hit thrift stores all the time and pick up anything "weird" we could find as a prop. There were something like 40-50 props in the room. All little things the PCs could touch and interact with. And eventually they had to figure out how to operate everything so they could escape the tomb. Well. In the end, it would only release one person, but they didn't know that.<br/><br/>I think Patrick Kapera (crafty games) can top this story, though. He ran a Cthulhu game in his house. And everything in his house (including his car keys, which led to his Jeep which had documents in it pertinent to the game) was "LIVE" and part of the story. He even (I shit you not) tied up his girlfriend and left her in the closet. The other player did not find her for over an hour.<br/><br/>Love the Lacuna phone idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332900/#Comment_332900" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T16:44:26+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  4:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, I have an old black bakelite phone with no dial that would be perfect for that.

We had an unused 12 story building at our disposal, with working elevators. So we made the elevators into a system of portals and defined each level of the building as a different alternate reality. The majority of the game occurred on the ground floor (with 20 odd players), while certain groups would be sent up and down the building when they went off to explore other parts of the setting. It became easy to determine who was where in the game because different players would physically be on different floors of the building. Of course a prop of this magnitude requires a few GMs to handle properly.</blockquote>\nEDIT: PS. <blockquote>a stripper (but that would be more like a LARP, eh?)</blockquote>\nI'm so glad I'm not the only person to have used strippers as a live prop in a LARP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332947/#Comment_332947" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T04:19:49+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  4:19AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2011 4:20AM by framweard.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just dressed up as Mr. Johnson for one of our shadowrun sessions.<br><br>Three piece suit (black), nice shiny shoes, mirrorshades, briefcase, PDA, etc. We played out the negotiations, and then I took off my coat and glasses and rolled up my sleeves and ran the session using notes I had stored on the PDA and handouts I kept in the briefcase.<br/><br/>It was kinda neat.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332949/#Comment_332949" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T05:18:39+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  5:18AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was a kid a friend of mine's family had a new spiral staircase put on their house leading up to a new room.

I found one that would send pre-recorded messages to a number at a specific time. So it was set up in game that players would receive a call at certain points throughout the night. The climax of the game was resolved, and they left for the evening, and then they each got another call on their cells on the way home that told them there was a big surprise. <br/><br/>There were many times we would all go to dinner as a group, and would go to some big important dinner in the game as well, so we had to play in character the entire time at dinner. <br/><br/>I made a "Find the pieces of the McGuffin" sort of quest for our game, and in turn made a scavenger hunt across campus. <br/><br/>I built a website with hidden content and messages, with MySpace pages for NPC's all as part of a conspiracy investigation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332966/#Comment_332966" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T10:00:26+00:00" title="July  3, 2011 10:00AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Warhammer 2E campaign where the Sigmarites were considered not-very-friendly-at-ALL.

(Music that was actually being produced by characters in the game.)<br/><br/>In a Necessary Evil campaign I was running, one the PCs (most of whom were supervillains) had begun kidnapping citizens, bringing them back to the hideout, tying them up and dressing them as the Village People.  He still had two to go.<br/><br/>A short time later, after the PCs had been away, they returned to find their hideout had been taken over by the Zombie Master, a supervillain NPC who had the power to animate and control the dead using music.  For the most part, any music he had playing would do, but most of the time it was music being played by his undead jazz band. (Yes, I was going for something cheesy and over-the-top.)<br/><br/>I put in a CD with a jazz mix I'd put together for the session and told them this was the music they could hear the band playing as they fought their undead minions.<br/><br/>Then, when the first round of zombies was down, I stopped the CD and had the Zombie Master say, "I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of completing your set." Then he pressed play on the boom box one of his minions was carrying.  I put in the second CD, which was a mix of the Village People, at which point five more zombies (three of whom had been the PC's kidnapping victims) emerged, dressed as the Village People.<br/><br/>So, yes.  I made my players fight undead Village People.

And he points to one of the guys' badges.<br/><br/>At that point, we looked at all the different pictures. Some of them looked like things that had already happened. Others were clues about upcoming things and how to deal with them.<br/><br/>We'd been wearing clues the whole time! It was awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333175/#Comment_333175" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T11:10:53+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 11:10AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't in the game, but I saw the Maltese Fhtagn, and thought it was pretty spectacular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333665/#Comment_333665" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T05:14:50+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  5:14AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably the video of a dead dictator giving a speech that got played on a loop throughout one dystopian, Orwellian larp.  I went online, and recruited Remi Treuer and Jason Morningstar to play the dictator and a government propaganda news reporter.  Then the dictator's speech played continuously in several areas throughout the game area, so even though he was dead the dictator felt like an overbearing, omnipresent Big Brother type NPC.  And partway through, you started to hear the dictator's speech patterns work their way into the speech of the players.<br/><br/>The soviet-style propaganda news report, meanwhile, played on a bank of old TVs near the snack table.  I borrowed a signal spitter from work, so all the TVs showed the same thing constantly.  And I replaced every framed photograph in my house with pictures of the dictator, sometimes with propaganda slogans alongside.  This was several years ago, and I still am finding pictures of the dictator staring at me.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Another larp had a lot of success using QR codes and a cellphone barcode scanner to replicate a sonic screwdriver/tricorder type device.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333666/#Comment_333666" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T06:08:25+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  6:08AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha, I knew I remembered seeing it: <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-5P2iOEsAkFo?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P2iOEsAkFo"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/5P2iOEsAkFo/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span>  &lt;&lt; Mr. Morningstar the news reporter <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333671/#Comment_333671" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T07:40:31+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  7:40AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's it.
