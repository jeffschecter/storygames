My son is nearly eight, my daughter just turned four. (We have yet another daughter, but she's too young to play with dice, because she tries to eat them.)<br/><br/>We've tried some different approaches. One that I've played a lot with my son and his friends is what we call "dice stories". They're based on "Shadows". The kids make up some heroes ("I want to play a jedi! His name is Arthur!"), I start telling a story, and after a few sentences I say: "Now something good might happen, and something bad might happen. Who wants to make up the good thing, and who wants to make up the bad thing?" They each suggest something, roll a die (there's usually only two players), and whoever rolls highest has their thing happen. We usually play for about fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>Lately my son wants to play more role-playing games (i. e., being more "my guy" and exploratory, not story game-like narrator stance stuff). That's what we're playing now. I've drawn a map - that is, the edge of a map, with a boat and a village - and they're exploring it. They meet strange creatures, magical locations, and sometimes find treasures and weird items. So far they've met a skeleton (who ran away with the treasure it was guarding), some giant spiders (who hurt my son's character badly), and some talking trees (who were terrorized by a monster which my daughter's character turned into a good wizard; they fed him peanut butter sandwiches until he was stuffed and happy).<br/><br/>When something challenging happens, we each roll a die. I'm the opposition, of course. Each character has something they're good at - if they do that thing, they get to reroll once.<br/><br/>It's been really interesting to me to see how my son, who started with story games, has decided he wants to play role-playing games more. Not sure what that's an expression of, other than the fact that the two modes are recognizable and different even to an eight-year-old with no theory background.<br/><br/>It's fun to see what characters they make. (Chargen is all freeform). My daughter started out as an evil queen, who turned into a good princess along the way. One adventure started with the characters waking up in the palace, and a little squirrel jumping in the window. The princess... shot it. For no reason that I know of. The dice were in her favor; it was a nice, clean kill, and we moved on to something different.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211680/#Comment_211680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T13:17:53+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  1:17PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 1:26PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome!<br/>I'm super into how kids view role play.<br/>Do you think adding the tactile things(the map)helped?<br/>My friend's daughter visited us while we were gaming and she seemed a bit perplexed that we didn't use little men.<br/>It bummed her out that we were just talking.<br/>While we were "just talking", she emptied out a cardboard box full of plastic figures and organized them all on the table.<br/>It was kind of neat!<br/><br/>(edited to fix things)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211684/#Comment_211684" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T13:22:33+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  1:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think having the map helps us to feel like we're really exploring something. It says "here's the space you have available, and this is what you know so far". It's also a nice focus for the game, to keep our attention on what we're doing. My daughter has this strange habit that if we play/tell stories while she's sitting in the car (with no distractions), she's fine, but if she has toys around her, she always wants to incorporate them even if it makes no sense in the game - "and then they found some crayons, and a pillow, and a horse, and a cat, and another crayon, and the lego".

Trying to learn more about how to put together sessions lead in a roundabout way to wandering through the forums here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls have come to count on a weekly session.  Basically, they've taken to playing like ducks to water.  A few things I've done that seems to help out:<br/>\n<br/>\n- During the week I'll occasionally hint at the upcoming adventure ("The Amulet of Yendor has been stolen!"). This usually leads to wide eyes, indrawn breath and the two of them whispering and giggling (usually a good sign :)<br/>\n- I keep the sessions fairly short (less than an hour).  The ending usually comes after they've overcome some challenge and with a wrap up that signals the end ("The Queen's servants lead you to comfortable rooms where you can eat and rest after your long journey")<br/>\n- Faery's Tale uses "Essence Points" as a way for the PCs to "nudge" the game.  I dug up some jeweled beads that we use to keep track of them.  Fiddling with them gives the girls something to do with their hands while they play.<br/>\n- For tonight's session I tried something new.  I used a tool for creating "Magic the Gathering" style cards (Magic Set Editor) to create cards for the NPCs that girls have met or will meet.  I pass them out as they encounter the NPCS.  I just used photos and images dug up through Google.  They really liked those.  More things to fiddle with and the pictures seemed to inspire them quite a bit (I mean, who wouldn't be inspired by David Bowie as the Goblin King? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, it has proved to be a really enjoyable experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaery's Tale: http://firefly-games.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=48<br/>\nMagic Set Editor: http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
