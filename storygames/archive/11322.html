I'm really trying to make an effort to understand something here, and I know I don't have the Japanese fluency to really do my own research.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to understand is this: is sexism pervasive in all Japanese RPGs? Or is it just present in the ones that are being translated?<br/><br/>So here's my issue. I have publically gone on record as loathing a subset of Tenra Bansho Zero's artwork with every fiber of my being. There are some images that very strongly imply sexual violence, and I have been public about saying that I hope to god that Andy has the sense not to publish the book (if he ever finishes the translation) without modifying these images. Then there's Maid, which the whole concept of just makes me cringe. Yes, yes, I get that the randomized tables are amaaaaazing. You can have a zombie ninja catgirl maid, OMG! But I can't help but be turned off by a game in which you play women competing for the attentions of an emotionally distant male "master". And now Andy posts a preview of King of RPGs, which I can't help but notice portrays only one female player, and portrays her as passive and sluttily dressed to boot.<br/><br/>Not encouraging.<br/><br/>So what's the deal here? I'm not conversant with the Japanese gaming scene. Are there Japanese RPGs that have balanced portrayals of women that just aren't being translated? Or is sexually violent art and de-emphasis of women routine in JRPGs? I'd like to disclaim at this point that I AM an anime fan. My two favorite series of all time are Sailor Moon and Fushigi Yuugi, both of which involve the female characters being naked pretty much 50% of the time. So it's not the random nudity that bothers me so much as the implied violence and the de-emphasis.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251415/#Comment_251415" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T12:48:57+00:00" title="January 19, 2010 12:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2010 1:06PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify: King of RPGs is not a Japanese role-playing game. It's an American comic about RPGs, in the same genre as Knights of the Dinner Table, Dumnestor's Heroes, Order of the Stick, and Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic*. It has nothing to do with Japan at all, except that it tries to look like manga.<br/><br/>Japanese TRPGs are, like in the US, a geeky boy hobby, and thus they reflect the content of geeky boys' media. As far as I know there are no girls' RPGs, though I could be wrong about that. I know that Ryo Kamiya, who wrote Maid, has also written a game about animals than turn into people and make friends with each other which is pretty far removed from anything that might tip you off (not exactly sailor moon, though. More miyazaki.)<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>* Which, respectively, have one girl who's a butt-kicker, have one girl who wears mid-riff bearing leather armor and is a love interest, have two girls -- one who is a GM and one who is the main character, and have many girls and woman in varying positions and with varying interests.<br/><br/>P.S. I think that there's a depth of gender critique in Maid that you're missing, but honestly are we going to resolve that in a forum?

From what little I've seen and heard the RPG scene in Japan is actually a little better gender-balanced than in the West, but Japan is definitely behind us a bit in terms of feminism. Looking through the collection of Japanese TRPGs I've amassed, I would say that on average they're basically on par with Western RPGs in terms of how they treat/depict female characters (which is to say not blatantly offensive, but with some definite room for improvement), though there is <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/bbnt/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Beast Bind: New Testament's cover</a>, which on reflection would be up there with Exalted's <i>Savant &amp; Sorcerer</i> in terms of being an RPG book you probably shouldn't be reading on the train.<br/><br/>I agree with Ben that there's is a bit more to Maid RPG that might appear on the surface, but I'm not about to tell people not to be bothered by it. (We knew what we were getting into, after all.) However, I can say that the other Japanese games I'm currently working towards publishing should be much more palatable in that respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251434/#Comment_251434" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T13:59:47+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  1:59PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel the same way you do, Anna.

As with everything the devil is in the details. <br/><br/>Anna, <br/><br/>Speaking of the devil details... do you think Japanese RPG artwork (even just that getting translated) is actually worse than that in North American RPGs? Or is it just an issue of our exposure? <br/><br/>I mean, I mostly do small press games these days, and tend to think to myself "oh, there is less blatant sexist shit in RPGs than I remember." Then I go to the FLGS and spend 10 minutes looking through the more mainstream games, and realize that maybe there isn't. There is still a lot of huge tits, fear of the scary sexual women, and women who get to be kick ass only in so much as they can get you hard (and assure you that you can still fuck them) while kicking ass.* <br/><br/>So, I sometimes wonder if it isn't just which things we're comparing.

People who turn it down typically seem to be thinking that it's Japan's answer to FATAL. It's more like Japan's answer to Toon in a lot of ways, and it has repeatedly shown itself to be a game that in play draws out whatever's inside the people playing, for better or for worse. In both published scenarios and actual play the "Master and his maids" trope is at turns celebrated, subverted, ignored, or altered beyond recognition. I've seen the Master variously be a little girl, a computer, the antichrist, a shrine god, totally absent, a bumbling scientific genius, etc., and I've had Masters get usurped or outright killed by their supposedly loyal maids on occasion.<br/><br/>But then, Maid RPG is an outlying case, probably on the level of, say, Macho Women With Guns or something. For the most part you'll be seeing Japanese geeky sensibilities rather than American geeky sensibilities, which are at times problematic, but in different ways, and with about the same level of subtlety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251500/#Comment_251500" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T19:58:35+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  7:58PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, no worries.  I don't think your comments were way off or anything, just the way they got ordered made it look like a bait and switch.  (Anna said "I have a problem with X" and you replied "Nothing wrong with Y.")<br/><br/>For the record, my reaction to Maid* is pretty similar to Anna's.  I haven't read it, and have no interest in playing it, because of how it's been exposed to me.  Now, the responses I've seen in this thread, seem to indicate that maybe that perception is not carried out by the game in play.<br/><br/>If that's the case, then this is pretty much about marketing.  Insert old, unresolved debates about Panty Explosion here.<br/><br/><br/>James<br/><br/>*and not just Maid, for that matter.  I find a lot of the entertainment I've seen that makes it over here from Japan to be kinda skeevy.  To be fair, I find a lot of the entertainment that starts over here kinda skeevy, too.

There's a whole lot to unpack, though, so I'll pull it apart into streams.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>is sexism pervasive in all Japanese RPGs? Or is it just present in the ones that are being translated?</blockquote>\nSexism in General<br/><br/>(As Brand said, above) I don't see that sexism is pervasive in Japanese RPGs any more than in US RPGs. That is to say, there's a lot. <b>There really is a lot</b>. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seriously</span></b>. And no one with eyes and common sense will deny this. <br/>There's about as much sexism as anywhere else, though.<br/>I've actually seen far more flagrant, titilating guys-only cheesecake in German and French RPGs than I have in English and Japanese games combined, for instance (well, ok, maybe if you remove from memory the "Avalanche Press d20 line of Squatting Hot Chicks" from the Western camp).<br/><br/>The other interesting thing is that there are far more women involved in RPG writing and production in Japan than the US. Like, it's almost 50-50 depending on what organization you look at: The folks that did Meikyuu Kingdom have 3 female writers/artists/staff and 2-3 males IIRC. The largest RPG company is "Group SNE" (#2 in rank of RPGs only, but they also produce lots of board and card games which pushes their published numbers up higher). Here's a picture I took of their office last year:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_2A0KK9xHmWA/SRSGosIaXiI/AAAAAAAACN8/4s1kY0kBh3c/s640/IMG_0681.jpg"/><br/><br/>This shows most of the staff of group SNE: 3 men, 3 women. Not pictured: 2 other guys (including the president of the company), one other woman. The women in the white is Sanae-san, she's actually pretty famous for her series of replays she writes for various RPGs, "girl gamer columns" and the like. And Group SNE's works are not in the "offensive" list, but there are the usual pictures of strong, kick-ass women in piecemeal bikini armor and the like. In fact, one of Sanae's replays for an otherwise serious RPG called "Demon Parasite" is called "The Demon that Makes Your Clothes Fall Off!", basically featuring her and some of her gamer girlfriends tearing a game up into an anime hijinx game with plenty of anime-fanservice, complete with surprised almost naked chick on cover <a href="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JirQn9EwL._SS500_.jpg" rel="nofollow">link to pic of that replay book from Sanae here</a>.<br/><br/>In general, though, most games feature about as much splatty fanservice as you would expect to see in a western RPG, which is incidentally far less than in your average TV anime these days. The art is surprisingly tame in general in comparison. I know this sounds like a gross generalization, but I'm staring at 4 shelves' worth of JRPGs now and only finding a few that I would put my finger on and say, "Yeah, as an adult I'd rather not be seen reading a book with this art from that page on it". Like 3, maybe (the cover of Beast Bind above is one of them, a supplement for another FEAR RPG by the maker of Tenra Bansho (more on that in a bit) and some of the hijinx drug-sex-violence art in Satasupe Remix (basically the RPG of a Guy Ritchie Movie). And to compare, when I go to the gaming store that sells US comic books and browse the racks, about 80% of them I wouldn't want to be seen with (but even in high school I was uncomfortable with the sudden ramp-up in sexualization of the early 90s around the days of early Image that appeared even in the X-Men series and other traditionally normal/tame series).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>And now Andy posts a preview of King of RPGs, which I can't help but notice portrays only one female player, and portrays her as passive and sluttily dressed to boot.</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, I can't comment more on that item, as I haven't received the book yet. Acting from the original US-comic format that I saw years ago, all I remember is that she's VERY ACTIVE (a central character)... and sluttily dressed. As Ben mentioned, though, that's a US manga so doesn't really fit (although the Chinese-American artist was emulating the Japanese story/picture style of Japan).<br/><br/>So the conclusion: Japanese RPGs have sexism, there's no doubt (they also are written more by women, but that's an incidental throwaway item): But about the same as US RPGs.<br/><br/>I would rank them, from most sexism to least-sexism:<br/>Japanese Anime that appears on late night satellite TV<br/>French RPGs<br/>German RPGs<br/>Japanese Anime that appears on normal TV<br/>Average US comic books <br/>Average Japanese manga<br/>US sitcoms<br/>Japanese RPGs - American/Canadian RPGs<br/>Japanese Anime that appears on NHK (public TV)<br/>Anime that appears on US TV                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251509/#Comment_251509" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T21:56:23+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  9:56PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2010 10:10PM by Andy.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2<br/><br/>On <b>Maid: RPG</b><br/><br/>I'll be blunt: <b>Macho Hardcore Disfunctional Roleplayers from the Forge Fucking Ruin Maid</b>. Period, full stop. <br/><br/>Let me explain.<br/><br/>(editing/localiztion issue with the first print run aside) The game has titilating material (random item table, among other things, features a vibrator in all but name as one of the hundreds of items listed). It has replays that feature some titilating acts (seduction between PCs, etc). However, normal game reports basically read out like a transcript of a game of Toon or Teenagers From Outer Space. Me and Ewen have Google Search Alerts that trip up when someone mentions the game, pointing us at various online blog posts, replays, chat logs from IRC, and so on. We scoured the internet for "touched in a bad place" play reports, even roaming through 4chan (English) and 2ch (Japanese, at least I did a few times) and found: Butkis. Nada. I sometimes see anonymous posts where people rail on about how a bunch of pervs somewhere did horrible stuff with it, but when I go through those chat logs waiting to see the paint peel, I see anonymous anime-lovers just playing normal games of Maid: Wacky hijinx, maybe some fanservice. I see some awesome sessions, I see some boring shit sessions where people quit playing, but I've yet to find this secret lair where people take Maid and play domination fantasies with it.<br/><br/>I've had people tell me their experiences with the game, far and wide: Face to face at conventions, in private or through blog comments ("We played Maid last night!" "Hey, what happened in your game?" etc). The folks that are into anime play it "right". We are maids. The master is our master, and we serve him in some way. The undisclosed (UNNEEDED to be disclosed through even lines-and-veils discussions that are so popular in our circles with small press games before we get to the child-shootin' and animal-abusin') discussion of "the master's player (if a player, or the GM) isn't a dick to the players above and beyond the plot. the maid's players aren't dicks and will just simply try to follow the guidelines of the master's role unless the drama calls to shake it up."<br/><br/>In all the few dozen games I've ran or played at this point (most of them in the last year), all goes well. Master issues orders like "make me lunch! take me to school! protect me from the ninja please!" The Maids run around trying to dodge bullets while cooking casseroles, deal with the scenarios threats (yakuza, wizards, monsters, whatever) and have some laughs. Normal anime-viewers *get this*. Normal anime-roleplayers *do not need this explained to them*.<br/><br/>However, when I see someone who is into hardcore indie games give the book a whirl, I tend to have to brace my head from having my eyes roll out of their sockets. In our community, The Rules are important, and THEY, not the feel, setting, or advice of the game, are what Set the Feel of the Game. So put it into the hands of a hardcore Forge-style macho roleplayer, and what happens? Again, I've never seen the flood of base indecency that some people expect from a "pervy anime game", but I see some shocking shit that I never, ever see with /normal people/:<br/><br/>* The game gets a lot darker. Quickly.<br/>* The master, if owned by a player, starts quickly "jumping to throat-ripping conflict" by issuing gut-wrenching orders that fuck up the lighthearted feel of the game.<br/>* The same starts to happen with the players.<br/>Since the rules have at their core a reward cycle of "players getting points for doing as told and pleasing the GM/master character", you can see the gears turn in the Macho Roleplayer's Eyes:<br/>"Aha! It's a game about Domination! I see it in the core of the game!  Well, therefore we have to make a beeline to get at the core of this game. Dominate, Dominate, DOMINATE!": I have seen the first order issued in such a game from a player-master (female) "Give me a sponge bath!". We had The Lines And Veils Discussion right after. <br/>* "We can't have just silly antics, I need to take this shit to the Next Level to show how hard I can be! More adult themes, More in-your-face conflict!"<br/>* "I'll get in your face, but you can totally get in mine, too! That's how I like it! Hit me harder with your conflict!"<br/>* Then the game breaks, as the macho hardcore player forgets the social line between Maid and Master, and tries to make their Maid the master, the master the maid and so on (only fair: There is no number or rule attached to the role, snicker)<br/><br/>I mean, seriously, it sounds like hyperbole, but I've seen this shit happen in three games/demos I ran (from quick demos to full-length sessions), for what I would call "Hardcore Macho Roleplayers who are into Intense Forge-style RPGs". If it was just once or twice, I'd think it was a fluke. But then I turn around and run a session at an Anime con or local RPG gathering, and it plays out again like an episode of a silly anime (ohhhh, /maybe/ with a single fanservice pantyshot or something), all without me having to explain lines and veils, without having to carefully state what is and isn't appropriate for an anime-themed game.<br/><br/>I don't hate that it happened or anything, to each their own fun and all that. But if you look at the game Maid and say, <br/>"Huh, this looks like a lighthearted game"<br/>"This looks like a pervy game. I mean, seriously, MAIDS?"<br/>"This looks like a game I totally would not like"<br/>...then I say to you, "thumbs up!"<br/><br/>But if you look at the game and say, <br/>"This game has some mechanics about relationships and a core where the players get points for following the master's orders or pleasing the master, and optional rules for romance between PCs. Therefore, the game is all about dominance, in-your-face hardcore competitive relationships, and every moment that you play this game you are not invoking those rulesets you are wasting your time", then my response is<br/>"Oh, what's your handle at The Forge? I'm 'Andy Kitkowski' there. PM me".<br/><br/>-=======================================================<br/><br/>OK, now, the above was just an air-cleaner about what I see that kinda irritates me about Maid discussions that happen around S-G, RPGNet, and The Forge. I totally respect peoples opinions of "It's totally not my thing", "I just don't like the pervy elements that appear in the book", "I can't see much interest in it with me or my group", "I'm not into anime", "I'd rather spend my time on an adventure-themed anime-style RPG", etc. But I wanted to get beyond the whole "the set of rules within the game are all the game can possibly be about" stuff I see here and there. And I also totally welcome discussion on that matter.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251512/#Comment_251512" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T22:17:32+00:00" title="January 19, 2010 10:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/><br/>I have no discussion to offer.<br/><br/>Only want to say thanks.

That's before I kinda stopped posting there (the era I like to refer to as, "The era where [Edited: A guy whose handle rhymes with "Fynn"] showed up and fucked everything up, despite me loving the people there I started loathing what I was becoming posting there."). I didn't know you still thought about those posts: I wish I did, as I could have addressed those concerns sooner (Basically, I started a thread a few years ago there called "Man, I'm kinda troubled by this art" and posted a few pics at the time from one of the supplements of TBZ, but I quickly came to a resolution on that issue, see below). Unfortunately, it's kinda like dragging people into a conversation where they can't see what we were discussing, so I'm trying to look for those pics now so I can post them for folks to see what we're talking about. Anyway, \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>I have publically gone on record as loathing a subset of Tenra Bansho Zero's artwork with every fiber of my being.</blockquote>\nOh yeah, not even an issue: Those two pics are not appearing in the book. I decided that back in that thread a few years back and never looked back. Nowadays that I'm in editing/rewrites of the last sections, there simply is no place for their existence anyway.<br/><br/>To summarize for the audience (I'll look for those pics again, they should be stuck in some subfolder somewhere): Tenra Bansho Zero has a lot of art. One might say a Metric Shitton. A lot of it was done by the author of the game, who to make a long story short kinda has a thing for skirts and large breasts. For example, while not even a handful of the women that appear in the book have huge tits or slutty outfits... it's about 3 or so in the main book, I think? (the cover's oni-chick, the ninja chick, the onmyoji-with-the-open-kimono-chick)... anyway, the few that are there are like "jaw-dropping cheese". Kinda hard to get around. IIRC, Anna, you said "I get that".<br/><br/>There was a pic of an mecha pilot (whom are all children in this game, ala Evangelion) in basically their "warm womb-chamber" place, but the girl was all sweaty and it looked kinda "...hmmm" (and that, IIRC, was the only pic that you were kinda iffy on from the actual main book, the pics you hated were not from there, see below). We're toning some colors down to make it look like what it is: Sweat, and not some see-through kimono fantasy.<br/><br/>But the pics that I had a problem with and about which I posted over at Knife Fight were two that appeared in basically a supplement-of-a-supplement, a 12-page piece that had 2 scenarios in it (about 5 of these were published). They features two pieces of art: One was a ninja lady who had just been "defeated in battle", she was all banged up, a sword stabbed in the ground in the area between her legs, she had some kind of leotard with mondo cameltoe (or in Japanese, "mekosuji"), and again she was lightly clothed with runaway tits. Obviously, given the contents of the scenario, it was the intention of the artist to draw "defeat of the busty ninja in this war-scene", not "gang-raped and shamed ninja chick". And yet, the art just by itself screamed the latter, uncomfortably and jarringly so. That led to that discussion at KF. I remember a few well-meaning folks being kinda gung-ho about how hardcore it was and how much buzz it might generate if included or something, but I pretty much decided then and there after sharing to not include it regardless, it just wasn't setting the tone of the game. In truth, I probably had already set my mind on that path, and just was looking for second opinions or suggestions at the time. I mean, it was a "darker scenario" and all that, but it just didn't fit the tone the book needed to convey (which was "in this game, you definitely do not play a huge-titted ninja with torn clothes who gets brutalized and lays shamefully with a sword jabbed in the ground near your crotch".<br/><br/>The other art piece was a similar piece, something like "young non-busty girl Oni tries desperately to unite the human and oni people... and she totally has cameltoe showing. And the knots in her dress, if you squint your eyes, look like her nipples are being pinched". Yeah, not as bad at all as the above, but still it didn't make me comfortable.<br/><br/>In both cases, it wasn't like I'm spray painting over the features that are already in the art of the rulebook (editing the art, which in artistic circles in Japan, and notably this one in a very real way, is a big creative No-No), it's simply "I have the ability to include all material from the book, the supplement, and the supplement-of-a-supplements (scenario packs, basically)". Including all the text and art, even pulling them apart (including the art without the text, for example). And I simply said, "Hmm, these two pics really don't fit the mood that the main game is trying to convey." Later on, I simply came to the conclusion that I had no room left for those scenarios anyway, but still, the plan was to include all art - even the titilating, cheesecake art (up there with "saucy manga" or "any issue of X-Men since 1992") - and simply omit those two, plus one or two others that didn't fit for thematic reasons (pictures of family crests, etc).<br/><br/>Hope that makes that bit clear. If it makes any difference, those two pics that you were concerned about were drawn by another 3rd-party artist, not the author of the game (it kinda does to me, knowing that the richness of the setting was first and foremost in the author's eyes, and not just an outlet for a pen and a fetish: To contrast, see the manga "BASTARD!! (<a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/bastard!!/Halucard999/bastard01.jpg" rel="nofollow">Kinda NSFW preview here, which also happpens to be one of the LEAST cheesecakey/fetishy pics I've seen this dude draw, for real)</a>" to see what happens when a fantastic, talented artist uses the guise of a fantasy manga to do nothing more than create fetish art for himself).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Oddly, I didn't notice that kind of sexism in the actual text of TBZ, but I didn't pay close attention to the art. I don't think the game itself (play-wise) is that sexist, though now I'm tempted to go back and read it just for that.</blockquote>\nYeah, the text is free of sexism (completely, even going as far as to include female Buddhist monks and warriors, as well as the usual spiel about "this isn't real historic Japan, so none of those locked-in gender roles, people"), with perhaps an eyebrow raised in the Kugutsu section. The art is where sexism can be found. But as I see it, "As a low, peaceful valley totally free of any signs of... oh wait, over there are Three Giant Fucking Mountains, which kinda jar our view and feel of the rest of this peaceful sexism-free valley". Opinions vary and all that. <br/><br/>That's incidentally why Anna's opinion, and other anime/manga viewer women's opinions are important to me. The game, with its powerful women in the art and text, really attracted a wave of female gamers into playing this game when it came out in Japan in the mid-90s, almost like Vampire: The Masquerade did in the West. Now, games with powerful (but yeah, admittedly often sexualized) female characters are pretty common in the west and all. But still, I like to hear the opinions of women who might be potentially into the game, who are into and "get" anime/manga, to gauge interest. Not really for marketing/sales reasons (I could really give a shit less on that front, on how many copies sold etc), but just to see if it is coming near the feel/ideal that it hit when it was released in Japan.<br/><br/>Anyway, hopefully that helps explain things for a bit.<br/><br/>Sometime in the next few days, time permitting, I'll post about other J-RPGs that exemplify "normal RPG" that don't feature cheesecake, have strong female protagonists, etc. Which is pretty much Almost All Of Them.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251522/#Comment_251522" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T23:20:39+00:00" title="January 19, 2010 11:20PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, humbly I apologize for my overuse of the parenthesis (like this).

Frankly, any authority figure will do, and as demonstrated by the sample scenarios, the employer of the PCs could just as well be something more abstract (such as a god or a government) and doesn't necessarily have to appear "on screen" during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251559/#Comment_251559" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T07:33:31+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  7:33AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can someone please define for me the terms "fanservice" and "replay" as they are used in this thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251562/#Comment_251562" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T07:52:01+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  7:52AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Japanese "service" (saabisu) is a loanword referring to giving a customer something extra for free.

I'll admit that I'm biased when it comes to Maid. I can NOT get my brain past Maid because I *loathe* the maid fetish. Being an anime fan, I am familiar with the tropes inherent in the maid fetish and it just bugs the shit out of me. The maid fetish is just plain sexist.<br/><br/>Also, I'll agree that mainstream RPGs are still horribly horribly sexist in their depictions of women. That's why I spend a lot of time here in small-press land. The thing is, there IS a small press land where I can go to get away from drow women with no clothing and GHOULS WITH VISIBLY ERECT NIPPLES (I wish I was joking). What I am not conversant enough with JRPGs to know is - <b><i>is there a similar scene in the Japanese RPG world? Or is it all like this?</i></b><br/><br/>I mean, I can go to games like Dogs, or Polaris, or PTA, or WGP... (just to name a very, very, very small subset) and get books with wonderful art that isn't exploitative and sexist. Is there a similar subset of games in Japan?<br/><br/><b>Specific comments:</b><br/><br/>Brand: Overall, no, I don't think that anime style artwork is worse than what gets published in mainstream RPGs. (With the very notable exception of TBZ.) However, we have the wonderful land of small press RPGs where USUALLY if women are naked it's not all exploitative. (Though there are exceptions on this front as well.)<br/><br/>Everyone defending maid: THE MAID FETISH IS SEXIST. That being said, play it if you want. I freely admit to not having read the game. I can't get past the fetish that inspired the game. Who knows, it might be the most wonderful commentary on gender ever created. Myself, I just Don't Get It. (Seriously, I've seen maid animes. They make hair curl.)<br/><br/>Andy: I don't remember if this came up in that thread, but I do remember also having a problem of the picture with the moist chick in the mecha practically getting tentacle raped by wires and making "helpless O face". That being said, thanks for such a good summary of the issues with TBZ.<br/><br/><b>Re: the philosophy of sexism</b><br/><br/>*Eyeroll*<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm not going to engage with this except to say that sexist depictions of women might sell RPGs to people who enjoy those depictions and people who are willing to swallow their dislike of these depictions for the sake of the hobby but having NON exploitative depictions of women would be better for business overall because then you'd have women actually feeling welcome to participate. Last time I checked, we made up roughly fifty percent of the population. If you want to debate the philosophy of sexism and whether or not porn is sexist (it is, erotica isn't neccessarily), take it somewhere else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251580/#Comment_251580" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T09:01:22+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  9:01AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>I could have sworn that when I was in Yellow Submarine in Akihabara I flipped through a bunch of standard adventure fantasy JRPGs that looked more inclusive of girls than our standard RPGs.

For visual learners, this is a fascinating way to break down and explain not only how the RPG works in some detail, but also what the author *did* with it, including points of awesome and points of confusion.<br/><br/>I'll see if I can scan one of those, as its worth sharing: In each one there were almost always female players, and always female characters. The art was standard adventure fare and comical without drawing attention to sex.<br/><br/>There's some games that employ that as well.

You just need to know where to look. Admittedly, I have been away from Japan for far too long, but when I lived there, I would go to my local game stores at least twice a week (mainly because those were some of the few places a geeky, hairy foreigner like myself could be without drawing too much attention). I'd have to look at my collection again for some of the specific titles, but among the various ones I have, there are games like: the high-school test-from-hell game; school-gang game; "Twilight Zone in School" (a simplified version of Call of Cthulhu, which was VERY cool, and consequently the only one I can remember the actual title of immediately); a historical Edo-based game; etc. Again, I'd have to go through my collection for some specific titles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn't a heck of a lot of small-press or indie games (at least when I was last there), though there is an annual zine that collects minigames (I think it was RPG Treasure Chest??? ...also can't remember it's name at the moment). Mostly storytelling party games, mini board games, etc., but there were a few in the '98 copy I had that had glimmers of what we see in the American indie game movement...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251590/#Comment_251590" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T10:00:08+00:00" title="January 20, 2010 10:00AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I see anonymous anime-lovers just playing normal games of Maid: Wacky hijinx, maybe some fanservice.</blockquote>\nSo, how does fanservice work at the table?

Had a <i>Key of Fanservice</i>, too. Sometimes the Story Guide would add the fanservice, sometimes the player. And of course a player could prevent the compromising detail with a successful <i>Chastity (I)</i> check. (Pretty meta-gamey at times, as you can have fanservice without any other characters being in the scene - so against whom is she re-arranging her bathsuit, again? The camera?)<br/><br/>As for the original question, my take is that sexism is prevalent not in Japanese rpgs in particular, but in Japanese culture in general. All Japanese cultural media I've ever seen include a majority of material that can be considered sexist as we understand it; there is of course non-sexist stuff, but using the minority in case studies to argue that the Japanese culture overall is not sexist is pretty ingenuine; of course there are non-sexist anime, manga, novels, tv drama and roleplaying games in Japan, but that doesn't make the sexist majority go away.<br/><br/>(Having articulated the distinction between majority trend and minority exceptions, it's of course a good question whether American culture is any less guilty in this regard; maybe the amount of sexism is less, but I wouldn't claim that it's not a majority without thinking about it a while.)<br/><br/>I for one find it rather rational if a person who vehemently dislikes sexism stays away from Japanese cultural products (as well as culture industry products from other sexist societies), or perhaps picks his Japanese entertainments carefully from the subset of non-sexist material. It's notable, though, that calling the sexist mainstream hostile to women consumers is somewhat simplifying: much of Japanese culture, sexist material included, is consumed by women. It is, in my understanding, possible for women to enjoy sexist culture in many ways (including ironic, nostalgic, empowering and sentimental modes, to pick a few), so claiming that sexism is automatically a losing market proposition is a harsh simplification of the real issue; if sexism really was a massive disadvantage in the marketplace of culture, I imagine that we'd find it much less prevalent than it is now.<br/><br/>Also, for those who might not have thought through what sexism in culture actually entails: sexualization (also prevalent in Japanese culture today) is not the same as sexism, which is to say apportioning cultural significance to gender roles. Culture created for a female audience can quite easily be sexist and yet popular - one of the easiest routes to this is to utilize female-positive sexism like the Japanese magical girl genre often does. I'd be interested in whether Anna finds the sexualization and negative female image to be the problem in Japanese rpgs, or if her problem is that they're gender-conservative and make assumptions about people's identity based on their gender. (Or perhaps both? That's reasonable, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251610/#Comment_251610" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T11:26:13+00:00" title="January 20, 2010 11:26AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: Okay, a bit more abstract than I really wanted to take things. As I said before, I'm not really interested in discussing sexism in general. I just happened to see a few things that really pushed some buttons and said 'oh, shit, is that a trend? Or do I not have enough data?" So, briefly.<br/><br/>I'm drawing a distinction between sexualized depictions and exploitative depictions. As an anime fan, I'm totally aware that the Japanese have different attitudes regarding this sort of thing. But there's a big difference between, say, Sailor Moon or Fushigi Yuugi where you have a good story where the characters just happen to be naked a lot and stuff that comes packaged with art that implies sexual violence or exploitation.<br/><br/>Also, I realize that women still consume sexist media. (Because if we didn't what would we consume?) But there is a HUGE DIFFERENCE between the sexism in the media at large and the sexism found in mainstream RPGs. If you don't believe me, take a good look at the banners the next time you're at GenCon. The sexism in mainstream RPGs tells women "you have no worth except the titillation your body parts provide for male gamers".<br/><br/><br/>Those of you who have been providing specific answers about the Japanese gaming scene: Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251630/#Comment_251630" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T14:24:35+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  2:24PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite>So, how does fanservice work at the table?

If this was an anime, this would totally be the scene where you see her skirt flap up into her face as she tumbles."<br/>...that's about it. Usually a 3rd-person style narration of some event giving a nod to the fact that there's fanservice, but not often actually making it titillating or anything. I mean, fanservice is visual, and all we have in tabletop RPGs is our <i>words</i>.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251656/#Comment_251656" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T18:30:59+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  6:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/><br/>I'm with CK, that was awesome.<br/><br/>Also, I identify with that Forge archetype you describe and yet, I totally got Maid.  I played it once and I made the "Teenagers From Outer Space" comparison myself and I only played that game once when I was like 14.  That said, when I played Maid we had as the situation "a robot maid is delivered" and I *did* grasp onto the implied Story Now Premise of "My job is being threatened what do I?"  That lead to me trying to please the Master (don't fire me!) and undermine the threat (see, the robot maid is broken!) and maybe undermine my fellow Maids (fire her, not me!)  But it was all done with crazy "get rid of robo-maid" antics, not creepy domination games.<br/><br/>On the sexism topic, I often find that if you look *past* the surface level social-role/fetish what you have is often gender positive.  To me what makes Maid work is that the male Master is utterly helpless without the maids.  Sure on the surface he's the powerful male being serviced by a cadre of hot women..... but he's useless without them.  They're the *real* power in his life.  Sure, sub-dued, in the background and never aggressively so, which perhaps can be read as how women "ought" to be and is the essentialist downside but ultimately it does carry a: Poor, poor, helpless man, where would he be without us women theme.<br/><br/>That's my reading anyway.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251671/#Comment_251671" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T19:37:30+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  7:37PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, <br/><br/>Interesting read.

Loved the posts, especially the stuff about the role of women in the production and play of JRPGs. And I totally hear you about your decisions on the artwork. It couldn't have been easy, but I'm glad to read about your process for making the decision. <br/><br/>One thing I'd note is that it isn't just in Japan where a lot of sex-class-problematic stuff is produced and consumed by women. In North American mainstream publishing you'll not be able to swing a stick in many of the places that are most exploitative of the sexual or social objectification of women and not find a woman involved in the creative process or production. (No, they aren't just the models. A lot of women are producing it too.) Which really makes sense, if its about making money and/or doing something you're good at and/or doing something that is creative if not always perfectly moral (and how much creative work is?) then you're going to find women doing it. There is no magical "I'm female therefor I'm perfectly sexually enlightened" button. <br/><br/>But now I'm getting all social and shit.

Typically, the PCs are the ones who are expected to "go out and do everything" because that's all in the job description. (In one of the sample scenarios, they are literally sent out to conquer the known world as generals for an army of monsters, in the name of their Dark Lord whose "mansion" is pretty much Mordor.) For example, when using the random charts for generating a master, two of the six possible character types are Small Child (who doesn't know anything about the outside world) and Recluse (who doesn't <i>want</i> to deal with the outside world). Stat-wise, masters (whether male, female, or neither) are one small step above mooks, and often practically incapable of taking care of themselves, at least without sacrificing their position: the only feature that distinguishes them is the authority derived from some specific source of power which they can quite easily lose during play, and which an ambitious maid or butler may also gain, for that matter. Money? That's simply one more Power Source among many others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatest amounts of Favour in the game are rewarded for saving the master's life. From a player's perspective, it naturally makes sense for you to ensure that this supposedly superior figurehead remains in constant danger so that the PCs can earn their pay. That shouldn't require much effort, in any case: after all, masters can be injured, abducted, replaced, or even eliminated entirely by random events. They are far more vulnerable than the arguably superhuman maids who from the start might go up against Cthulhu with a fair chance of winning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, blind obedience is hardly the only possible motivation for the staff, or even the likeliest. They could just as easily be secret agents of the master's archenemy, thieves looking for a treasure hidden somewhere in the mansion if money is all that matters to them, or Illuminati-style conspirators who view the whole set-up as a convenient smoke screen for their own schemes while their employer will take the blame if anything goes wrong. They might be time travellers trying to protect the master because of the great things that she'll accomplish in the future, or demons from Hell charged with corrupting his very soul. Yes, they take orders from someone else and wish to keep their jobs at least for the time being, but the actual <i>reasons</i> behind that can vary wildly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251709/#Comment_251709" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T06:16:37+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  6:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi guys.

If you pay 500 yen ($5.00), you can pick one off the wall and your Maid hostess will play it with you.<br/>Cut to laughter as we talk about walking into the cafe with a copy of <b>Axis and Allies: Pacific</b>. "Here's 500 yen. You get to be Japan. Here's your fleet pieces, and our house rules on how National Control/Production Counters work... LET'S GO!" Maid with a very confused and kinda worried expression on her face.<br/>(canned laughter)<br/><br/>And then cut to "4 hours later..." as the Maid is <b><i>utterly kicking our asses</i></b>: "That just cost you Taipei, bitches!" Says the Maid as she rolls her pieces across the board, the second-to-last player falls to her mighty strategems. Cam and I are off to the side, crying and comforting each other.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>**[[I'm actually on the side of "horrified" that Akihabara turned from the Electric Town of Tokyo (and the world) to the Otaku Town, and yet I totally understand the socioeconomics of how it happened (local government's fault: They kept raising the prices of taxes and tennentship in buildings, which drove out the eclectic and bizarre electronics specialty retailers - Like the hole-in-the-wall 10'x10' stores that "only sold printer cables", "only sold home PC internal components from 1980-1990 PCs", "only sold LEDs/Fans for Pimping Out Your PC", etc) over a period of time, and made room for bizarre and eclectic anime/manga/pop culture-themed specialty retailers, which rake in sliiiiightly more money.* And it wasn't a conspiracy to turn it into an Otaku-gai, it was simply small-time retailers looking for cheap space who heard that Akiba was the place to find it. By the time anyone in charge of the area buildings or in local government noticed the trend, it was too late: Well over half the hole-in-the-wall electronics stores were now selling T-Shirts, Body-pillows featuring anime characters in pajamas, wall scrolls of panty shots, and so on.<br/><br/>* This is also happening at GenCon, mind. There are few New and Interesting RPG/Game retailers with their wares at GenCon, and more and more "wacky T-Shirt", "Utili-kilt", "bootleg DVD", "stuffed animal", "used/traded CCG" retailers filling in to take their place because only they can afford the booth price hikes.]]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251721/#Comment_251721" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T06:52:37+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  6:52AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2010 7:06AM by FigureFour.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In that case I apologize for being cranky as well.<br/><br/>I guess discussing sexism tends to do that to me, so I'll refrain from trying to participate further.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Maybe if we could mentally recategorize this as "This is something I feel.

It's the misconceptions about <i>Maid</i> in itself that I generally find worth pointing out (much as happens when someone is mistaken on, say, the diceless mechanics in <i>Nobilis</i>): the actual preferences of others are no skin off my nose, obviously, since there's no arguing about taste. As said before, the notion that the play revolves around "women serving a man" is a false premise to begin with (given that the master isn't male by default and the maids may not be female), and reading into that some statement about gender roles in society or how <i>all</i> women "ought to" behave only carries the whole line of thinking further astray.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe maids in the game aren't "the real power" in some vague behind-every-great-man sense of taking care of domestic chores and then staying out of <i>The Man(tm)</i>'s way. Instead, they are essentially fantasy superheroines who have, for whatever reason, chosen to use their powers in someone else's service. Most of the time, that involves bailing their unlucky or incompetent employer out of one trouble after another.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Or, for those more keen on butlers, think about Jeeves and Wooster. That particular master-servant relationship certainly fits in with the play expectations like a tailor-made gentleman's glove.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251725/#Comment_251725" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T07:07:41+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  7:07AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I was looking at the preview panels thinking, "Y'know, that one dude...

I'm really, really, trying really hard to make a distinction between the fetish and the game. I understand that a lot of people like the game, and for them it's about more than engaging with the fetish. And I'm cool with that. It's just that I recognize that my feelings about THE FETISH have made me totally not objective about THE GAME. Which is why I'm really, really, really, trying to say that I just won't comment on THE GAME because I can't be rational. I'm trying to be rational and not indulge in Internet Crazy.<br><br/>The reason why I'm trying to avoid the conversation about sexism in general is because this thing always happens on the Internet. People go, wait, if you think Thing X That Might Be Sexist is sexist, then what about Thing Y That Is Definitely Really Blatantly Sexist? And then why I say, 'yes Thing Y is sexist', I get counter-accused of being sexist myself. And then I get furious because the person accusing me of being sexist is inevitably male. And I'm not taking away from the right of men to speak out against sexism (hi, Brand!), but on a totally not rational level I get mad because men never have to deal with men talking to their breasts and then everyone gets caught up in Internet Crazy and yet another conversation that might have been useful goes down in flames.<br/><br/>Been there done that.<br/><br/>So yes.

If this was an anime, this would totally be the scene where you see her skirt flap up into her face as she tumbles."<br/>...that's about it.

Maybe it helps that he's a butler for a VERY elderly couple, and so any sort of "lewd demands" are laughable. Also, IIRC, maids are rarely addressed by the house master (or mistress): depending upon the staff size, maids will be instructed by (from smallest to largest house size):<br/>1) Butler, house manager, major domo<br/>2) Housekeeper<br/>3) Head housemaid<br/><br/>Now, a <i>lady's maid</i> might report directly to the house mistress. But that sort of senior servant is tantamount to a personal aide, confidant, etc--and might even have been the lady's nanny or nurse maid (or even skivvy) in her previous household.<br/><br/>Anyhow... just so's ya know.

Obviously not the "live in someones house and clean up after them" type that the maids in Maid are, but the kind that cleans up your motel room. Also often known as house cleaners, but at the motel I worked at the term was maid. <br><br>The hotel manager was a horrible old racist woman. I had been working there as the night auditor for a few months when she fired one of the maids for asking for leave because she was going to have a baby ( I mentioned that my boss was horrible, right?). I said that I'd fill the position because I needed the extra hours, but she didn't want to hire a man for what she claimed was a woman's job (she wouldn't hire women to sit the front desk either). She changed her mind after she ran an ad for two weeks but couldn't fill the position. I worked the job for 3 months alongside my night audit duties, until I ended up quitting.<br><br>So... um... ask away?<br><br><b>Edit:</b> Not that house cleaners have much of anything to do with the maids in Maid.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254060/#Comment_254060" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T09:55:41+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  9:55AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jake!

One of them was a long time customer who stayed with us every week or so, and who I talked to all the time at the front desk. When I showed up to clean his room he thought I was there to just hang out (which was a little weird, since hanging out in customers rooms was not something I ever did. You learn early that if you don't want to get bitten, punched or stabbed ((I got all three)) that you stay at the damn desk). Anyway, when I explained to him that I was there to clean he got weird about it. I couldn't really figure it out, but when I talked to some of the other cleaners later they said that they thought it was because he knew me, and had a kind of limited social relationship with me. Apparently he had never spoken to any of the cleaners in the years that he had been staying there.<br/><br/>So that was kind of weird. The other thing is that my boss just became unbearable. She treated us all really badly, but she had a special hatred for the maid staff. That's what eventually led me to quit.<br/><br/>Also, I was never really embarrassed about working at the motel (it's one of the better really bad ones in Portland), but when people asked what I did during the last few months I was there I never mentioned that I was also doing maid work.<br/><br/>Also also, the maids made a dollar less an hour the I did at the dsk, but had to do a lot more work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254154/#Comment_254154" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T19:48:54+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  7:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>That's what eventually led me to quit.</blockquote>\nWait, getting stabbed didn't lead you to quit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254157/#Comment_254157" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T20:02:35+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  8:02PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>That's what eventually led me to quit.</blockquote>\nWait, getting stabbed didn't lead you to quit?<br/><br/>Stabbed twice (once on accident).

Mostly it would be 8 hours a night where I wouldn't see anyone at all and was left to do whatever I wanted, with only about 30 minutes of real work that needed to be done. It was nice. It was during this time that Matt and I wrote Panty Explosion.  <br/><br/>The downside is that every now and then some crazy person comes and kicks down a door and you have to put yourself between them and your renter.<br/><br/>Anyway, we've derailed this thread, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254171/#Comment_254171" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T21:22:43+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  9:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>So that was kind of weird.
