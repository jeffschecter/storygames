As you may know, Knutepunkt is the Scandinavian larp convention that rotates through Finland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. At least some of the Scandinavians are interested in scholarly perspectives on role-playing; there's a whole category of programs at the con devoted to "researching larp," which is where my paper fits in.</p>\n<p>But I don't want to go all that way to just to present one measly little paper! And so it occurred to me another thing I could do was try to run <b>Ganakagok</b>, my game of quasi-Inuit tribespeople facing the dawn after an eternal night, as a jeepform game. Now, my exposure to jeepform is limited at best, but Ganakagok is I think what the jeepformers would call a "lightweight RPG" (i.e., "the missing link between tabletop and freeform") and so it seems like it should be possible to toss the dice mechanics and character attributes overboard, leaving the situating-generating mojo of the Tarot-like "Ganakagok deck" in place for some jeepform goodness.</p>\n<p>Here are my initial ideas on how to do it; I'd appreciate comments both from cognoscenti and uninitiated.</p>\n<p>So "Ganakagok jeepform" is a game for 4-12 players. Each player begins with somewhere between 4 and 10 cards, each of which contains a pictorial and verbal motifs (e.g., the picture of a polar bear, the label "Bear," and the phrase "to overcome or master" as well as a value and a suit "Ancestor of Tears"). Any of these motifs can be drawn upon in a freeform sort of way to introduce new elements to a situation or define aspects of a scene; the rules of the game just have to be about distributing the authority to introduce and interpret cards in the scenario.</p>\n<p>GAME START. The GM introduces the setting:</p>\n<p>"This is the isle of Ganakagok, a great iceberg floating in a star-lit sea that has never known sunlight. We are the people who live in this world. We call ourselves the Nitu, and for time out of memory we have made our lives in darkness under the stars, hunting out on the ice, making clothes and tools from fur and bone in our ice-built village houses.</p>\n<p>"We are also the spirits who shape this world. We are the Ancestors of the Nitu, who from the world beyond the world seek to guide and protect their descendants. We are the Forgotten Ones, who long ago carved the upper reaches of Ganakagok into soaring spires, intricate labyrinths, and secret staircases. We are the Stars, stern judges of righteousness for men and beasts.</p>\n<p>"And soon to come among us is the long-prophesied Sun, who will take his rightful place and bring about a new age in the world, casting down those who displease him."</p>\n<p>PART ONE. COSMOGONY. We create the world and the People in it.</p>\n<p>First, the GM takes four cards. He or she reads two cards in combination as the Situation of the World, and two cards in combination as the Situation of the People. All players are invited to contribute possible interpretations of the cards, but the GM takes all of those suggestions and puts his or her stamp on them in laying out the specific situation.</p>\n<p>Next, players go around and flesh out the situation by playing and interpreting cards, speaking in character as the spirits.</p>\n<p>Speak as a ONE OF THE ANCESTORS to play a card and add a character to the <b>Nitu Map</b>, defining him or her with a name and <b>identity</b> (a two-part phrase describing the character, e.g., "arrogant youth").<br/>\nSpeak as a FORGOTTEN ONE to play a card and add a location or event to the <b>Ganakagok Map</b>.<br/>\nSpeak as any kind of spirit to play a card and give a character a <b>truth-vision</b> (how the character knows that Dawn is coming).<br/>\nSpeak as the SUN to play a card and give a character a <b>change-hope</b> (what they hope will happen as a result of the Dawn, or of resisting it).<br/>\nSpeak as a ONE OF THE STARS to play a card and give a character a <b>change-fear</b> (what they fear will happen as a result of the Dawn, or of resisting it).<br/>\nSpeak as ONE OF THE PEOPLE to play a card a define some aspect of a character--a relationship, a trait, an important biographical detail, and so forth.</p>\n<p>This part ends when everyone agrees that the situation is fully and sufficiently developed.</p>\n<p>PART TWO. GANAKAGOK. We live in the world as dawn approaches.</p>\n<p>ACT I: NIGHT. We develop the initial situation, staging scenes as necessary to reveal the tensions among the People, or between the People and the World. We learn which characters are in fact our protagonists.</p>\n<p>ACT II: TWILIGHT. We allow the tension to build, and see what choices our protagonists make.</p>\n<p>ACT III: DAWN. We come to the climax of the action, and see the consequences of our protagonists' choices.</p>\n<p>ACT IV: MORNING. We learn the final fates of the World and the People.</p>\n<p>Each act consists of one or more scenes involving one or more characters (including spirits, monsters, and beasts as needed); any player may take the role of any character. Players may call for scenes to develop the story as they desire. An act ends when its narrative function is fulfilled. Draw cards as needed for inspiration and guidance.</p>\n<p>That's what I've got so far; I anticipate fleshing out these rules so as to have a stronger sense of how to incorporate jeepform techniques into the game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191825/#Comment_191825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T07:59:34+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  7:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Bill, some general challenge-type questions.<br/><br/>Is there value - in terms of the experience you're trying to facilitate - in generating both characters and situation communally?  I think a typical Jeep approach would be to front-load a good amount of that to ensure interesting and possibly specific sorts of interactions.  Just hand people Nitu already fixed in roles and enmeshed in crisis.<br/><br/>Do you think it'd play the same with 4 as with 12?  Why that range?  <br/><br/>What about facilitation and game mastering?  I think this will be important, and you'll probably want more than one.  How hands-on do you want them to be?  I see great potential for Jeep techniques like Bird In Ear to help create a world alive with spirits and invisible monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191897/#Comment_191897" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T11:47:44+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 11:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Thanks, Jason. Great questions; really helpful. I'm loath to back away from one of the strengths of the Ganakagok tarot, which is situation generation in play.  But it's true that games of Ganakagok tend to rely on certain stock types: the chieftain, the shaman, the hunter, the warrior, the wife, the mother. So maybe there's a minimum of front-loading that I could do to provide the bare bones upon which to build a scenario collaboratively.</p>\n<p>Also it occurs to me that I could use the spirits as a sort of hybrid player/GM role, with players taking on the roles of Sun, Stars, Forgotten Ones, and Ancestors in order to do GM-like things in the game. The game would then be as much about the relationships between humans and their gods as about the relationships among human beings. I can imagine dividing the players into four teams, one for each of the four types of spirit (and perhaps the Sun "team" is a single player). At any given time, one player from each team serves in the GM capacity while others take on the roles of the People, with scenes enacted in order to show the human impact of the changes taking place and to advance the story in accordance with the team's goals. At the end of the game, the Sun arrives to judge the living and the dead.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191899/#Comment_191899" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T11:59:17+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 11:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>I could use the spirits as a sort of hybrid player/GM role</blockquote>\nOh, yes.  Do that.  The challenge there will be firewalling a participant's supernatural role and their Nitu role.  If your guy is in a scene, or called into a scene, you stop being a facilitator/spirit, which seems like it could be a jarring and dissonant transition.  Usually GM roles are fixed in Jeepform.<br/><br/>It might be cool to say "When you are not in a scene, you represent the following (assigned) role in the cosmology", and let people influence and direct and facilitate as an Ancestor, Cannibal Spirits, the Sun, whatever.  You are a GM with an <i>agenda</i>.  That's rock.  If you go with pre-generated character archetypes, the spirit roles could tie in really well - "You are Akooseruq's father, murdered by Pitsalaq's father the day Akooseruq was born."  Maybe you'd spend all your time as GM making Pitsalaq miserable, or engineering a disaster for his umiak crew, or whispering hateful advice to your own son.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201602/#Comment_201602" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T09:49:43+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  9:49AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So <a href="http://www.ganakagok.com/ganakagokfreeform" rel="nofollow">here's</a> what I came up with.

Hopefully that will be more widely viewable. In any events, I have high hopes for the game itself. The basic idea is that one player takes on the role of the Sun and uses his or her witnessing of the play of others to judge the Heavens, the World, and the People such that one is preserved, one is changed, and one is destroyed. The other players are both characters in the world and spirits with quasi-GMlike powers; they "win" if the outcome they want takes place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202726/#Comment_202726" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T07:30:06+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  7:30AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game went really well. I was a bit worried about the goal oriented nature of play withing the "teams", but as my fellow Forgotten One player,  Onni, put it: "It's (just like) a vampire larp!" The cards worked great, once people got the feel for interpreting them.  <br/><br/>The Star players seemed baffled at first. Their job is the most complex, since they are responsible for directing play as the players act out what the villagers do. And until they know what the situation is, they will have little ability to plan how to direct things so that they can work towards their agenda.  <br/><br/>It seemed like they were consulting throughout the scenes, and I know Onni and I worked together at various times. That may end up being a good way to do it, Bill. Having one person be the go to person, to make the calls and report the group decisions is great, to cut down on chaos. But letting more people jump in as desired, and to talk together as the scenes go on allows those who groups that are reacting to the actions of the others to be able to work together more.  <br/><br/>I loved how you brought together ideas from Forge-type games (the open-nature of the scenario, dividing the "gm" tasks among the players) with freeform techniques like live action of play and whispered direction and intervention through Celestial NPCs, monsters et al.
