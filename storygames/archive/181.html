The real intent and implication of the LP is upside-down from your reading: all the LP means is that designing rules IS designing tools the players will use socially. The rules can't make things happen in the game except by the active assent and participation of the players themselves.<br/><br/>On the questions of how you design rules, what you should design rules for, what rules make for good design, all your concerns, the LP is totally silent. It's a very small-brained, stupid little principle! It really doesn't have much to say, and what it has to say is head-slappingly obvious.<br/><br/>Leaving the LP aside, then, any designer foisting design work off on the eventual play group is a crap designer. Anybody using the Lumpley Principle to defend doing THAT, sucks. I agree with you there. But I don't know anybody but you who reads the LP as defending that.<br/><br/>-Vincent                </div>

                            What's interesting to me, Adam, about that first conversation of yours, is how at the bottom it lands on "do you trust your GM?" My experience is AS a GM, and I'm going "resolving by fudging and fiat is too hard! I hate doing it because it's hard work! PLEASE take some of the burden off my hands!" To me it's not a matter of "design rules to protect players from untrustworthy GMs" but "design rules to make the GM's job easy."<br/>

<em>any designer foisting design work off on the eventual play group is a crap designer.</em><br/><br/>While I agree with the broad strokes, I think there is some "design work" that any group needs to do.  In Burning Wheel, for instance, you need to decide which of the rule subsets you want to use.  In GURPS, you have to decide if you're running in Basic or Advanced combat.  If you're house ruling, that's design work.  It's not unreasonable for the designer to say, "Hey look, what I've got here may be close but not identical to the tools you need.  Here are some options, and this is the time to discuss this with your group."                        </div>

                            That's a great point, Vincent (re: "Do you trust your GM?"). But if you design to make the GM's job easy and they didn't think it was hard to begin with, they might not like it. "They" meaning: people like Rob and Fred and Jim in the threads in my LJ who seem to have lots of a certain kind of GMing skill plus certain expectations about player roles.                        </div>

The main reason i never really got into the whole "illusionist" style of GMing was entirely that for me it was simply *too hard* - I found that I could not make plots, and i could not railroad people into them. I did a great job refereeing the rules, but rules (for doing stuff in character) alone don't make a game.<br/>

                            Just so's everyone knows, BTW - I work 3rd shift, and so I'm rarely on the PC until late evening when my daughter is safely tucked in bed, or I finally get to work.  I'm not silent - I'm just most active online at 4am.  :^)
<blockquote>The real intent and implication of the LP is upside-down from your reading: all the LP means is that designing rules IS designing tools the players will use socially. The rules can't make things happen in the game except by the active assent and participation of the players themselves.</blockquote>
Let me explain a bit where I'm coming from - my model that I've been formulating over @ Elsewhere is concerned with all of gaming - not just roleplaying games.  In the model, there are four 'spaces' that a game game has: the gamespace, which is the set of all the legal moves as denoted by the rules (and modified by the players); the emulationspace (emspace for short), which is the equivalent of the SIS (shared information space); each player carries an individual information space (called the aspace) - which is essentially a mix of their perspective on the SIS combined with the rest of their prior knowledge; and the playspace, which is the social arena in which the game takes place.<br/><br/>The thing that I've been fighting with all day has been this: the Loody Poody (love that) assumes that the playspace and the gamespace are in unity, and affect the SIS; my model suggests otherwise - that there are parts of the social sphere which don't impact the SIS <i>directly</i>, but which are nonetheless important to the function of the game.  Was I wrong?  Does the playspace not exist?<br/><br/>And I've finally figured it out - yes, the playspace does exist as a separate entity - it's just that in some game forms, it's relationship with the gamespace is much more removed, and it is a much more distinct thing.  My exemplar of a game with very distinct gamespace and prominent playspace would be poker.  <br/><br/>Poker is highly social - bluffing, tells, the whole nine yards.  There's a very large social component to the game.  <i>However</i>, this social component, while it influences each player's individual information space (aspace), and thereby changes the shape of play, it doesn't change the gamespace (the rules of poker don't change according to social mechanics), and it doesn't affect the SIS because there really isn't one.  So in poker, the social negotiations (being driven by a desire to hide information) are separate from the rules of the game.<br/><br/>And so what I've come to realize is that the relationships between the the spaces in my model change according to the game being played.  In roleplaying games, where the SIS is, well, the crux of the game, the playspace and gamespace are very near unity - there are fewer social interactions that don't impact the SIS or gamespace in some fashion.<br/><br/>I'm working on formalizing this a bit more, and kicking the tires a bit.  But the upshot is that the Lumpley Principle holds true(r) for roleplaying games than other gameforms, and for narrativist games most of all.  But for some gameforms, the only consent and consensus are to agree to the rules of the game - everything after that may affect individuals and their course of play, but it doesn't affect the game itself.
<blockquote>Leaving the LP aside, then, any designer foisting design work off on the eventual play group is a crap designer. Anybody using the Lumpley Principle to defend doing THAT, sucks. I agree with you there. But I don't know anybody but you who reads the LP as defending that.</blockquote>
Well, let me give you an example of what I mean.  I have a copy of <i>PTA</i> in front of me (not that I want to pick on <i>PTA</i>, but I consider it an axiomatic narrativist game. In the section on Creating a Series, p. 16:
<blockquote>Every show has a setting, which includes a place, and usually a time period. [...]  If you have a premise in mind, this part is probably pretty easy to figure out.  But before you go any further, everyone should make some notes <b>and speak up about any important details that the do or don't want to have in place.</b>  [...]  <b>Just as important is to make clear what you don't want t address in the game.</b> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
So here's what I see as a piece of what the Lumpley Principle refers to as System which is non-systemic.  For any number of reasons, there are going to be times when someone doesn't feel that they can speak up about their wishes; there are a whole spectrum of group game dynamics ranging between pure democracy and GM-as-god.  What PTA is doing here is assuming that this sort of decision-making - consensus-building - is readily present in the group - that the result reached will be wholly satisfactory for all concerned; or that any compromises in satisfaction will be redressed.<br/><br/>So what I'm really trying to get at with my critique of the Lumpley Principle is that by putting 'everybody sit down and talk about it' in the same basket as the (much more impressive) mechanics for Fan Mail, for example, the LP <i>may lead a designer to leave groups who don't have these consensus-building skills in the lurch</i>.<br/><br/>I'm also not advocating a complete structuralization of the RPG experience from top to bottom - I'm not calling for 'Creating the Series Randomization Tables A-Z' or including a copy of parliamentary procedure in every RPG.  What I'm saying is that we, as designers, should fabricate tools to meet groups halfway to consensus - and if they don't need the tools, then they can just toss them out.<br/><br/>This also goes back to the whole 'damage' hoo-ha.  If groups <i>are</i> damaged, then I see games like PTA as a great way to help fix them.  But there needs to be a bridge between the two experiences that can lead a horse to water, if you get my drift.  In the end, it can only be a good thing for all concerned.                        </div>

                            Coming from a year-plus of playing  (extremely crunchy Nar), my initial reaction to  was a flailing feeling of "where're my mechanics? Where're the freakin' mechanics?!"<br/>
<br/>
But the weird thing about PTA is that that slender little rulebook does, in fact, ease you into the mental groove of "we're all co-writers on a series, brainstorming together." Even though there's no clear procedure laid out in a clearly identifiable chapter, it nurtures functional procedure shockingly well. In short, the PTA rules  -- which is the bottomline of functional rules, from a Lumpley Principle perspective.<br/>
<br/>
(I started writing progressively bizarre-er variants of L____y P____ above and scared myself back into the straight form. Vincent, you have broken my brain).<br/>
<br/>
So explicit procedure is not the only way to go; a book can convey  procedure to just as good effect. (And, when you think about it, disfunctional implicit procedures permeating the hobby, both in text and in oral tradition, have been a big part of what the Ron Edwards Crusade has been fighting against).                        </div>

<i>The thing that I've been fighting with all day has been this: the Loody Poody (love that) assumes that the playspace and the gamespace are in unity, and affect the SIS; my model suggests otherwise - that there are parts of the social sphere which don't impact the SIS directly, but which are nonetheless important to the function of the game.

<i>John, it looks to me like you're saying, "Well, the System is how we decide what's happening in most situations, but other times, we don't decide what happens; it happens and we have no choice in the matter."</i><br><br>How do you get that from what I said?  Everything within a tabletop RPG happens by choice of the participants (as opposed to a computer-moderated game like a MUD).  The same is true for most boardgames, too, so it's not like it's a unique principle of role-playing.  (A few games like Jenga depend more on the properties of an external system, but it's pretty limited.)  I said it's a specialized use of "system" because "system" is a word commonly used by people who have never heard of the Loody Poody.  <br><br>The point is that defining what "system" means says nothing about what games should be like.  Right?  If you don't agree, then can you show how the principle makes some prescriptive claim?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Not to sound like a horrible pedant - but then it's not a principle, is it?<br><br>OED again:
<blockquote>II. Fundamental truth, law, or motive force.<br/><br/>    5. a. A fundamental truth or proposition, on which many others depend; a primary truth comprehending, or forming the basis of, various subordinate truths; a general statement or tenet forming the (or a) ground of, or held to be essential to, a system of thought or belief; a fundamental assumption forming the basis of a chain of reasoning.<br/><br/>    7. a. A general law or rule adopted or professed as a guide to action; a settled ground or basis of conduct or practice; a fundamental motive or reason of action, esp. one consciously recognized and followed. (Often partly coinciding with sense 5.)</blockquote>
I think that the LP <i>is</i> a principle - it walks like a duck and talks like a duck - but it's apparently one that no one wants to take the risk of working out what it means to take it as given in the foundation of a game design.                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
As you say, the LP does, in fact, apply to any type of game with human interaction. Vincent's point was that the social rules, conscious or otherwise, are effective game rules (alongside whatever it may say in the formal instructions), though not necessarily the best ones.<br/>
<br/>
It is therefore clearly a principle, as it amounts to an axiomatic description of the phenomena. That means that the realization of the principle will lead game designers to look at the whole System in their games, as opposed to just representing fictional stuff, for instance.                        </div>

That is, how much do you make explicit rules for -- and how much do you leave open for the group to decide for itself.  For example, there are a whole bunch of rules which games still don't provide for:  How do you determine who is in the group, and who isn't?  What do you do when a player can't make it to a session, or moves away?  How do you determine when and where to play?  These are all difficult questions which gaming groups struggle with, but generally the game text doesn't help much with this.  <br/><br/>Different games provide different amounts of stuff.  For example, "The Pool" is a very minimalist game.  It leaves it up to the players to provide an awful lot, including not only setting, but also how to make an adventure situation, and a lot of other social issues.  I don't think there's a single best formula for how much (and what) the rules in a game text are supposed to do.  In some cases, the game text provides a skeleton and leaves the participants to flesh it out.  In some cases, the game text provides a bunch of flesh and leaves the participants to structure it.                        </div>

                            Yeah: and I'd add that, since what you're doing as a designer is creating a social situation, considering the effect of your rules on the social environment is your primary concern. Therefore, figuring out the quantity and types of your rules is your responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing to have a particular type of event take place in the social contract realm is fine. But if something has to take place in the social contract because you didn't think of it? That's flawed design.                        </div>

I've already iterated a couple of times - the implication that I see is that the LP groups consensus-building with what I guess you'd call the 'traditional' definition of system - (i.e. the rules of the game).  By making that grouping, I believe there's a temptation to substitute consensus for parts of the system which may need more structure; either to support groups that need it, or simply to enrich the game experience.  Essentially, that the LP takes for granted good consensus skills; I believe that designers should work from the opposite viewpoint.                        </div>

                            I have my copy of it *pat pat* right here, actually.  Granted, it's a PDF that printed off way too small, for some reason (I think that most of the type is 5pt in this bad boy - the text on each page is about 2.5 x 4 ... but it's here).  I wanted to re-read it after I had to feel around in the dark trying to work out escalation mechanics.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that even if the LP was a retroactive defintion of System as 'system (little s) + consensus', what do you get when you work <i>forward</i> from the LP?  It seems that folks don't believe that you <i>can</i> work forward from the LP - that's fine, but I'm not sure what the purpose of grokking the LP is if you can't use it for anything.  It's like saying "Well, Newton's Three Laws of Motion were just a specific defintion of 'motion' when you're talking about this particular universe, they don't really say anything about what motions of objects <i>could be</i>."<br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression that I'm somehow <i>against</i> the LP - in fact, I think that the LP is <i>fundamentally correct</i> when you're talking about roleplaying games.  I'm just trying to work out what the implications are for design work that's done with the LP as one of the pillars.                        </div>

<p>Lots of things.  Me, I've always found the parts of the games that run by consensus to be inferior in fun to the parts that run by rules.  So when I look at the Lumpley Principle, I realize "Oh, hey!  There's no reason that I have to let <strong>anything</strong> be done by consensus!  I can formalize it <strong>all</strong> through rules!  Cool!"</p>
<p>Yes, you could (as you point out) substitute consensus for mechanics.  You can substitute mechanics for consensus.  You can substitute bribery with sexual favors for either (or both).  If the LP makes you realize that, and it leads you to a good game design, great.  But the LP isn't saying you <em>must</em> use a blowjob resolution mechanic, it's just pointing out that if you do, then that's part of your System.  It's not like you've got System on the one hand, and fellatio on the other.</p>
<p>To my mind, the LP poses questions ("Will you resolve X by consensus or mechanics?") much more than it gives answers ("You should resolve X by consensus rather than mechanics.")  What do you think?</p>

It only says that whether you reach a decision through mechanics or unwritten social rules, it all constitutes your system for making decisions. If the group vests all power in the GM to make decisions about what can or can't enter the game events, then they have reached consensus, and the GM will make all such decisions without deferring to the will of the group.<br/><br/>The spectrum of possibility within the LP is anything from a game with complete GM fiat, to one with no GM in which all the players get an equal vote, to one in which most decisions are made by the rules.<br/><br/>Given that, I think Tony's question ("Will you resolve X by consensus or mechanics?") is spot on.                        </div>

                            "Leaving the LP aside, then, any designer foisting design work off on the eventual play group is a crap designer. Anybody using the Lumpley Principle to defend doing THAT, sucks. I agree with you there. But I don't know anybody but you who reads the LP as defending that."<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  Well, maybe I have a bit more radical reading of the LP than I thought I did.  Because I do see the LP as saying, essentially, that the act of play IS an act of design.  That is, the essentialy social nature of play means that players ARE designers.    "Resolve by mechanics" is only possible if we have a consensus agreement that we will resolve by mechanics - an agreement that always can (and sometimes does, even in games like Chess and Monopoloy - though I'm more comfortable sticking within the "collaborative, thematic play" box ) get rescinded and/or renegotiated.  "Resolve by mechanics" is a tool to create more interesting (and/or coherent, and/or speedy, and/or etc.) consensus agreements than if we just tried talking until we acheived consensus.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't think that excuses "foisting" design work off on the play group - give 'em tools, and good ones, or you're not doing much of a design job.  But I do (did?) think the LP told me the play group is ALWAYS the final designer.  The "real" game designer is crap or not-crap based on how easy he or she makes that final design process, in the context of the particular focus of the particular game.<br/>
<br/>
At least, that was my thinking coming in - and it still makes sense to me, so far.  I don't think it contradicts what Vincent and others (like Tony) MEAN by what they're saying,  but I could be wrong about that.<br/>
