I just think its sad that the top 10 percent of the posters here seem to make 99 percent of its rubbish.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260408/#Comment_260408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T07:11:19+00:00" title="March  6, 2010  7:11AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you're speaking English either, because I have no idea what you're talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dan%20Eison" title="Dan Eison"><img alt="Dan Eison" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dan%20Eison">Dan Eison</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260411/#Comment_260411" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T07:32:33+00:00" title="March  6, 2010  7:32AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lo, for in the long benighted eons of the Fifth Age after the Great Cataclysm, on shores of black-coral sand whose fey names good men were loathe to utter, there did arise from beneath the festering fens of Ig-N'oral a race unknown even unto the whitebeard scholars of Sem Agyrots, unknown to the lizardkin beyond the Gulf of Forchanta, a race more fell than fell, whose feral physiognomies bespoke the turmoil of their soulless minds. Their thunderous voices rolled and rumbled as the crashing surf upon the carious spires of their island home, and their power was like unto that of something long unknown but soon to be disclosed unto a huddled mass of trembling villeins who will tremble yet the more upon this heretofore-undisclosed entity's imminent disclosure unto them. All would soon know of their might, and their prestige would flow from them as lava from a fiery mount, for, let's be honest here guys, if the Estonians can get it together and form an self-determining nation-state, can't anyone? I mean, to be fair, Estonia is totally the world's premier exporter of folk dances and headscarves, so I guess that makes them qualified to field an army and make decisions about fishing rights along their stretch of Baltic coast, huh? Sure, I get it. Nice flag they have, too; blue, white, and black go together totally awesomely. Am I right? It definitely doesn't look like it was designed by a drunken smelt-fisherman who's brain is addled by fermented fishgut vodka. Those Baltic states have gone way over the line lately, forming trade pacts and negotiating maritime law together, excluding everyone else from their discussions of folk heritage preservation. I might be the only one willing to say this without the mask of anonymity that I might have on other forums, but I am totally opposed to their cliquishness. I just think its sad that this 10 percent of Northern Europeans seem to make 99 percent of its regulations and statutes governing the proper allocation of diversionary funds amongst independent fishing operations earning under 23000 kroon per annum. <i>Ausalt, milline on see pask? Kas sa arvad, godsorcerers on gmtutdia oleks taluda jama nagu see on</i>? Truly, while there once was awesome in the Baltic region, those Estonians have killed it. Fun, I submit, is no longer the enemy-- the Estonians are. For they are not what they seem. Their pleasant and gregarious appearance disguises from our sight the peril in our midst, for none now know the darkness that reared once and slumbers still in the heart of every one of them, waiting, biding, tensing for the strike that will cause the very vaults of the sky to tumble into the sea. They linger on their ill-begotten shores, hunkered in the gloom of eldritch darkness too dark for the keenest eye to penetrate, singing their songs from ages long-forgot, when once they ruled the other races of the globe and ground to dust beneath their heels all who would oppose them. Theirs again shall be the dominion, and all will be powerless to halt their accession to the celestial thrones of mad tyranny, for they were once the Necrogodemperor Witchsovereigns of Ig-N'oral, and they shall return!<br/><br/><br/>[/me being a jerk]<br/><br/>No offense intended, but your post just inspired some gentle satire. I'm not really a regular denizen of Story Games, so I'm not really bothered by the things you brought up, but I understand that it might be irritating to some. That said, I hope there's no harm in riffing on your themes. Oh, and I've really got nothing against Estonia. To any Estonians reading this: <i>I laiendada siirast vabandust.

language of the god kings and the death of awesome, and corn and not japan memes", which were all just brief, one-off jokes in my experience.  The problem with this thread is that it's an example of admonishing an entire group for the actions of a handful while passive-aggressively not trying to address the people who are actually doing it.  I have not personally encountered the myriad problems he seems to perceive here.  And finally, it's a necromancy of the horrific hand-wringing over "game jargon" we had, what, back in May?

The introspection and the analysis that occurs in the indie games community is often of a misguided sort that attempts to redefine games rather than discuss and design them.</p>\n<p>Basically this means that when I talk shop with a fighting games enthusiast, they understand what priority, block stun, tiers, etc mean because they describe real elements of games in that genre.
