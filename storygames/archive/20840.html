I made a short 2-page game for Halloween. It's a pretty simple meat-grinder heavily influenced by Event Horizon and The Sphere. I hope you enjoy! Let me know if you have any suggestions that could better it. Especially in the visual design department. That's not really my bailiwick so I can use all the help I can get. At any rate, here it is. Hope some people get a kick out of it. <br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3TMkYb-oWtRG9WWV9YME9oZE0/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">The Derelict Speaks.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457619/#Comment_457619" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T20:49:46+00:00" title="October 28, 2016  8:49PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, this is pretty cool! I like how focused it is, and how strongly tied to its theme.<br/><br/>The random generators seem pretty strong, as well. I think the "why can't we leave?" one is the weakest; I'd have trouble explaining a few of those. (Although, given your space restrictions, I'm not sure how you could give more detail - you probably have something specific in mind for each entry, but I don't necessarily know what you mean by each one.)<br/><br/>The visual design is OK. I find it a little cluttered and overly "in your face" - lots of different colours and fonts and shapes. It's a little overwhelming for me; my tastes tend towards the more aesthetically coherent and toned-down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457627/#Comment_457627" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T23:22:37+00:00" title="October 28, 2016 11:22PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback! I know what I want visually, but it always translates horribly. I think you're right, if I tone it down, keep it minimalist and consistent that's probably a better choice. <br/><br/>As for the "why we can't leave" generator, which entries did you think were the most obtuse? Like you say, there isn't a whole lot of room for detailed entries, but that doesn't mean I can't just swap out ones that don't work or don't inspire enough to be useful.<br/><br/>At any rate, thanks for taking a look. Very useful feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
