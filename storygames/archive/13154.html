I want premise and rules and sometimes advice... this is probably just a personal taste thing, but it seems like a great deal of really good game systems would be very difficult to present in an evocative way and that a great deal of confusion can occur when text tries to be evocative. I want rules that speak for themselves, through play.<br/><br/>I get the idea that I may be alone on this one.<br/><br/>*the game, not the review<br/><br/>So basically the discussion point is this: Do games and gamers hurt themselves (in as much as it makes actual play as opposed to interacting with the text less enjoyable) by wanting their game rules to also be good fiction and fun reading, and if so, why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296330/#Comment_296330" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-09T01:10:34+00:00" title="October  9, 2010  1:10AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funnily enough, the critique of mine stated that <i>"the very colorful text is a bit too long and wordy"</i>, so kind of the opposite end of the spectrum. I was very consciously channelling a particular theme for the game and writing that way just felt true to it and helped me maintain the right mindset, but I would probably go over it again now and do an 'English Translation', to make it more accessible to a wider audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, it did also say <i>"there probably aren\u2019t quite sufficient guidelines for the GM to create trouble, just a lot of encouragement, mostly"</i> which underlines the importance of fluff: what seems like a clear &amp; logical system to me is going to be utterly opaque to most other people. When I write, it's always with loads of potential examples in my head, so its important to show those to other people so that they also can map the mechanics onto real life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296331/#Comment_296331" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-09T01:19:07+00:00" title="October  9, 2010  1:19AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want your rules to be purely technical it helps a lot if you include plenty of brief examples of play (which take care of the "evocative" part, while staying out of your way when you explain the rules), preferably in side boxes or somehow separated from the text.<br><br>The danger of technical texts is that they tend to slide into either<br/>-jargon (using loads of game terms no-one has achieved fluency in yet, instead of explaining what goes on here, at the table, between these people or in the game's fiction, which anyone can imagine and keep track of. the rules will be harder to understand and follow)<br/>or<br/>-dry language without pazaz (if your game text is as boring to read as a washing machine operating manual, it won't excite people, it won't convey to them why it would be exciting to play. if your text has no charm, people will not be convinced the game has charm, because the text is the only thing they're going on)<br/><br/>So, a definite no, to "are fun game texts bad?" Your definition of "fun" might vary.<br/><br/>As to "good fiction", I think it depends purely on your tastes. RPG Manual Fiction is positively atrocious most of the time. In those few examples where it's actually good it can be as much as a nice read as a distraction. If you don't like fiction, you won't like it, if you enjoy fiction, that might be even the only reason to read the manual (I know people do that). Also depends on the exact definition of "fiction" in this context.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296333/#Comment_296333" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-09T01:44:52+00:00" title="October  9, 2010  1:44AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, tastes vary, it's a big old world.

Some people don't like reading the fiction. If you mix the rules with the fiction, you will put these people off. (Interestingly, White Wolf games are a good example of how to do this right: put fiction in, but mark it as separate, so people can skim or skip it if necessary.)<br/><br/>2. Everyone thinks they can write fiction, but not everyone can. (I'm not saying you can't! I haven't read your game.) If you write fiction, it's got to be very good.<br/><br/>3. If you're reviewing many, many games, as Jonathan is, you get sick of fiction really quickly. (Or, at least, I did.)

I mean, I'm thinking of some very complex old war games, like Squad Leader or Third Reich, in which the rules are both meticulous and meticulously presented. There is nothing fun about reading those rules (and I'm sure a lot of people would think there's not much fun in playing the games either) but no one expected the rule book to be fun, and, if they had tried to make them more enjoyable to read, I think it would have definitely hurt the game... it would have had to been simplified or modified so as to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say they didn't try very hard to make them understandable and readable. Squad Leader in particular had a very neat way of adding the rules in chunks with every new scenario.<br/><br/>So, if we expect the rules to be fun, and don't engage in play unless reading them is enjoyable or evocative, do we, as a community, deny ourselves some good play? Are games popular because they're pretty or because they're good?<br/><br/>And by fluff here I certainly don't mean engaging with fiction that emerges in play or setting or premise information that is an important part of "system" in the sense that it effects the play, or gauges or guides it. So I guess, its arguable, that any content presented by the designer is system in the biggest sense, but though I can't point to the line, I think there is one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296410/#Comment_296410" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-10T08:27:05+00:00" title="October 10, 2010  8:27AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always pointed out that D&amp;D3, and actually 99 percent of AD&amp;D2 and D&amp;D4 is virtually unreadable for enjoyment.

If you want to hang a game on nothing but a tight genre or premise, the rules have to be written to dynamically create the very spirit of that premise. If you can't have great rules, then a great setting is equally as good but (arguably) harder to sell to an audience who all have their own ideas and favourites already. Everybody wants to be an ideas man, so if you're going the second route your world's concept needs to be simple and compelling, but with plenty of depth in how it is executed.<br/><br/>Of course if you can have both great setting and great rules, brilliant!<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296420/#Comment_296420" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-10T10:07:39+00:00" title="October 10, 2010 10:07AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2010 10:09AM by Brand_Robins.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're writing a game (as many games are) whose point is that I'll play this game that feels like X (or X+Y) things from other media, then chances are I have no time for your fluff, as the fluff is that other media. <br/><br/>When you give me a brawny swords and sorcery game I don't want fluff, because I'll just go read Howard. Or when I get a Cthulhu game I don't want Lovecraft fanfic filling up the book -- I can go read the source material. (Chances are if I'm interested in your game, I already have.) <br/><br/>Or less directly, say we have a game about adventurers who fight dragons and go into dungeons underground and so forth, I don't need fluff as I can always read Lord of the Rings and the Dying Earth. Or hell, at this point I don't even need to do that, chances are that just being part of modern North American geek culture I've picked up more crap about dragons and pointy eared elves who are lovely and wise and...  blech. Anyway, I don't need fluff, I have it already. I just need big books full of detailed rules. <br/><br/>For games where you just want me to play in a genre and we can all assume some combination of 1) the setting being generic and 2) the things that aren't coming out of the group and the interaction of the rules as we play, no fluff is needed. <br/><br/>OTOH, for those very rare games where you actually want to give me something new to play, something that isn't "Like Tanith Lee filmed by Kurosawa" but is actually unique, having a flavor of its own, and with something specific to say then fluff may be called for. <br/><br/>I'll be happiest if much of the setting, even in a visionary game, can be embedded into system somehow. Burning Wheel lifepaths for unique and alien worlds, for example, can tell you a lot about those worlds without having big sections of ready-text. But even then, without something in the way of context and tone, chances are they aren't going to give me everything I need to actually enjoy the game. <br/><br/>And that extra context and tone in a game that is doing something unique, that's what fluff is good for. <br/><br/>(That it needs to be good fluff, as others have pointed out, goes without saying, right?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296425/#Comment_296425" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-10T10:59:46+00:00" title="October 10, 2010 10:59AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2010 11:01AM by masqueradeball.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/> I guess? I mean, having spent many an hour of downtime thumbing through D&amp;D books, I spent the majority of that time looking at optional mechanics for future levels or future characters, but so much of what you pay for in D&amp;D is packaging. I guess using the term "fluff" was a bad idea in that what I see as a problem here is that people pay for a package (or value a package) more than the product it contains. How much of D&amp;D 3's appeal was it artistic presentation? Can that be consider part of the "system" does Todd Lockwoods's "look at all my buckles" art style speak to the game in a way that effects how we play it? I don't think it does, but that package (along with marketing and legacy players) seems to have had a lot more to do with why D&amp;D was successful than not... I would also argue that the way they present the rules is full of "fluff" nothing is generic, it all comes with a lot of implied fictional context that isn't very useful in and of itself (IMO), look at the deluge of prestige classes or spells, those spells are full of color that often makes their rules application and use in creating any kind of consistent tone within the game's fiction impossible, or almost impossible.

When I first read MLWM I wanted to lick the rules off the pages they were printed on.

I don't mean the rules need to be overflowing with fluff. But they need to have <i>some</i>. If they don't I tend to think the author just didn't try hard enough.

I think <i>Polaris</i> represents the upper limit of my tolerance for setting-info; the reason for that being that I want material that gives me options that relate to play. <br/><br/>Hero Wars/Hero Quest is an excellent example of this: pretty much every cult, culture, ethnicity, and spirit-realm is an opportunity for either character creation or devising a frame of reference or even an aspiration for one's character or party. And this material is very exciting to read - it brims over with possibilities for play! <br/><br/>Vampire: the Masquerade, on the other hand, drives me bonkers - so much material consists of little throw-aways (Toreador <i>anti-tribu</i> communicate using a secret language based on jewelry!) that are really hard to bring to bear alongside other material, or incorporate smoothly into a concept for play, or, well... my point is that there's information that a game book provides that we can readily use to address exploration, challenge, or theme, and then there's stuff that reads more like a <i>product of play</i>. Thus, to me, it's so much fine powder or shavings that have cluttered the workman's table that is the ruleset. <br/><br/>Tamara, <br/>I think it's important to reconsider what Nolan (masqueradeball) is saying about transitioning from "fluff" to "packaging", although I would quibble with the latter term, also. I think it's important that any material presented in a book be either a) intended for use by players in their character concept/in-play exploration, or b) an explication on such material, to clarify what one is getting at (examples of play, developing dense ideas, etc.)<br/>As for why there's a camp of us gamers who are so clinical, as you put it (I think that term works just fine), I think gamers have been robbed, of time (as designers) and money (as designers and customers), for the sake of that strange, psuedo-story-crafting trend begun by the World of Darkness folks. Granted, a lot of people really enjoy reading all the meta-plot and setting material and so on, but it appears that such enjoyment stems more from pleasure-reading than from attempting to master the game. <br/>Nothing wrong with that. I just wish I'd realized sooner in high school that I didn't really care for that sort of thing, so I could leave it to those who enjoy it and go about my business.<br/>I also feel as though I've just encapsulated a few dozen Forge threads (some of them quite controversial) into a few sentences. ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tamara%20P." title="Tamara P."><img alt="Tamara P." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tamara%20P.">Tamara P.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296433/#Comment_296433" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-10T13:22:19+00:00" title="October 10, 2010  1:22PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac, I see your point.

It is all first-person fiction about what it means to be a magician in modern society. The theme of the book would be that mundane life is vastly important to keep your humanity, and the fiction explores how your character's mundane life should keep you grounded. <br/><br/>In a Mage game from several years back, my group read the book, and we had a long discussion over how "this is how Mage should be played". I believe the GM/Storyteller and the players were supposed to play this out in the game by selecting loved ones to struggle over, but the mechanics don't really support this theme at all. In fact, there were no mechanics supporting this theme. <br/><br/>In that Mage game, it quickly "devolved" into people-with-superpowers-blowing-stuff-up because you use magick to do impossible things, get Paradox for trying the impossible, use more magick to fix that impossible stuff, get more Paradox, and etc.<br/><br/>(I like Mage.

Metaphorically speaking, it can be discarded, leaving the substance of the overall text intact. <br/>I will add, based on previous comments, that "packaging" is material that neither a) informs the use of the mechanics or b) informs the immediate direction of play. I'll try to further define Clause B as I go.<br/><br/>I'm taking a look at Vampire: the Masquerade, 3rd edition, for inspiration. Pleasantly, I'm surprised to see that a lot of the stuff at the very beginning of the book is actually fairly purposeful: there's stuff about the slightly-tedious Gothic-Punk motif they love so well, which tells us what kind of vampire stories we're going to be creating with these rules (in theory). Then there's stuff about different kinds of vampires - not the clans, but rather different age groups, and then a quick word on those who are politically unaffiliated, regardless of age. These are relevant options to consider for character creation. <br/>This material thus fits into B - it has little to no mechanical content (beyond a quick reference to the Generation occupied by certain vampiric age groups), but it does tell you important, basic things about how the age and Generation of a vampire inform where they fit socially. Thus, the age and Generation of p.c. vampires is reflected, indicating what players should expect as far as how their characters relate to vampire society. <br/>Interestingly, most of Chapter One falls in this category - 3 of the Six Traditions (the laws of vampire society) are pretty well grounded in activities with mechanical backing - i.e. p.c.'s can create more vampires, and three different Traditions touch on the interaction of vampires with their progeny. Since there are rules on killing, and killing vampires in particular, Tradition Six (Destruction) covers explicitly mechanical activities. <br/>Traditions One, Two, and Five (Masquerade, Domain, and Hospitality), though, relate to more abstract, hand-wavey subject matter: whether one's vampiric nature is revealed to humans, the bounds of one's own territory, and the bounds of others' territory. Still, these fall into category B - they give you some ideas about what will shape play: territory, both literal and societal/conceptual. Stay on your turf, and you'll be safe. Heck, I think that constitutes a theme! Sweet. <br/><br/>The section "The Others", page 52, is akin to the brief section in Polaris about The South - there is very little mechanical connection or relevance, and it's a stretch to say this informs the bounds of play beyond a faint background theme. I'm ruling this section Packaging. <br/><br/>More straight-up Packaging to follow, and then I'll call it quits: "Ancient Lore" (p54, clippings from the vampire-history text <i>The Book of Nod</i>) is Packaging, indeed - - you do NOT need to know this two-page spread even exists. Caine is faintly referenced in the text, but I am of the opinion that knowing that the biblical Cain (even if his name's spelled wrong) is the progenitor of vampires should be more than enough thematic input for anybody familiar with his story to use it effectively to capture mood and such. But that's being generous - the game isn't *about* Old Testament tales or religion or anything. Not inherently. <br/><br/>Subsequent sections on Gehenna, the modern state of vampire society (really a recap and update on the official meta-plot; boo), and the Lexicon are also Packaging - they are far enough removed from what happens in play, or are really extrapolations from existing setting elements ("Modern Nights", the meta-plot update, hands down revelations about the fight between the sects) that any play group could arrive at naturally through actual play. <br/>For that matter, very little of the whole Sects and Clans thing escapes my definition: your clan informs who you're related to, and what kind of powers and outlook (on vampirism, etc.) you have, but you aren't mechanically supported to act one way or another about clanmates who aren't direct ancestors or parentage. Thus, how clans feel about one another, the sheer number of them, how they fall in the two sects... it's really just taking some archetypes, tossing them in two piles, and saying "You guys do it this way, too." Of course, the real, historical reasons for why clans are in their chosen sects probably has more to do with the order in which they were thought up and the order in which designers began to give support for players to actually portray Sabbat or independent-clan characters. Otherwise, Gangrel and Brujah would make way more sense in the Sabbat, same with Nosferatu, and the Lasombra would be in the Camarilla, imo. <br/><br/>Anyway, this all totally ignores the presence of game fiction. I think that is packaging at its purest, for a story-gamer like me.

So basically, I hate fluff when it seems to be displacing content.  I want the manual to help me with our game, and things that don't serve that purpose -- things that provide me no tools I can use to improve our game -- are anathema.  That's what gets me to complain bitterly; especially if the authors later on mention that they didn't include something because they "ran out of space," when it really should've been the fluff that got cut for space rather than real content.<br/><br/><br/>In contrast, I merely <i>dislike</i> fluff when it's badly-written, dumb, and obscures the presentation of useful information.  I don't get angry about that, I just skip over it and treat it like trash someone dropped along the road: a deplorable eyesore that they should feel guilty about.  If they were better people with better morals, they would have spent their time making the trip better and the destination grander, rather than shitting up the place.  But as long as it's not an obstruction, I can just shake my head sadly, let one perfect tear slide down my wizened and noble face, and move on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296471/#Comment_296471" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T06:29:03+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  6:29AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>RPGs do have to be reference manuals first and foremost, and if fluff is getting in the way of that it is a not inconsiderable problem.</blockquote>\nThe problem, I think, stems form the fact that they have to serve <i>two</i> purposes- 1) teaching the rules to the player and 2) providing a reference for those rules.

For example, a great many RPGs are based around what for want of a better word I'll call the Stats / Powers model. You've a bunch of statistics which interface with the rules, i.e. the part of the game that has to be taught, and that everybody has in common. That part of the manual is keyed towards teaching the system. You then have a list of special abilities, be they magic spells, combat feats or whatever, each of which provides its own rules. These are organised into categorised and alphabetised lists: the reference part of the manual. To further enable reference, each section title in the main rules will generally be large and with plenty of blank space around it so that it is easily spotted, and proper use of illustrations will also break up the text and provide the reader with a reference point, an easily remembered mental 'bookmark' that they will learn to associate with certain rules, making it easier to find the spot they are looking for in a hurry without having to refer too much to the index.<br/><br/>In keeping with the topic of this thread, fluff is usually treated in much the same manner as images or else separated out into its own chapters to prevent this from overly hampering the manual's usage. Similarly, 'Player's Guide' and 'GM Guide' material that deals with the whys and wherefores of the system often gets its own chapter, if it is dealt with at all. The problem, I think, arises when you've got too much happening at once, i.e. rules, fluff, reference material AND images all on the same page.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296473/#Comment_296473" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T07:16:22+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  7:16AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>I think it's very possible, and often necessary, to design with both in mind.

If I'm presented with a rules system without any explanation or indication as to how it ties in well with the theme of setting of the game, the first thing I'll wonder is why the writer bothered with a new system instead of seizing a simple one off the shelf. Fluff belongs with the rules and belongs with the reference (in limited quantities, mind you) to provide context. I think the current trend to hardwire the fluff into the rules (AW's Moves and their kindred) is very much a positive thing, because it limits the fluff to relevant fluff and makes it abundantly clear where the rules intersect with it. Naked rules in RPGs should be consigned to the dustbin of history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296474/#Comment_296474" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T07:17:30+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  7:17AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sidenote:  Art is not fluff.  Art is in these books for a few reasons.  <br/><br/>1)  At the very least, art serves as a resting point for your eyes in a sea of text.  These are not novels, these are text books.   And the brain retains information much, much better when coupled with visuals.  This has been known since at least the 1930s in advertising.  When the art is color, retention goes up even higher.  Modern textbooks are more and more turning to color for precisely THAT reason.  Since retention of rules and setting is really, really important at the table during an RPG session, this is why we have so much artwork in RPGs.  <br/><br/>2)  At the very best, on top of argument <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, art doles out information quickly and succinctly.  Sometimes without the viewer even realizing it.  If one fantasy world's dragons are the size of elephants, but another fantasy world's dragons are the size of NYC... this can be conveyed in a good illustration without you even realizing it... or without having to look up the stat block that states;  Gormbellimond the dragon is 14 miles long.  The illustration of Gormbellimond sleeping, wrapped around a large city, his tail in the harbor, his head resting on the bluffs,  with life going along pretty normally (folks hanging out laundry to dry near his enormous nostrils would be a nice touch).... all of that, you would have absorbed faster than it would take to read argument <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>3)  Inspiration, like setting "fluff", if someone gets an idea for a character or an adventure or a cool scene or a jumping off place for any of those things... that is the awesome icing on the cake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296476/#Comment_296476" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T08:05:23+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  8:05AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a certain emergent whole that comes from the brain putting all these little bits of information together. Lady Blackbird is an amazing example of this. Each part of the text adds a little detail, and if stripped of what is being called fluff in this thread, the soul of the document would be missing. The art, the setting elements hidden in the game mechanics, each little bit pointing toward something greater than could be constructed if it was put together as a text book would be. It is like poetry, efficiency of writing that creates an emergent whole. There is no way that a text book could have created this world/game, and John Harper even repeated much of the text multiple times throughout the 16 pages that make it up. <br/><br/>I guess I can say that the proper use of fluff will be more succinct and straighforward than any dry textbook could ever hope to be. Our brains are hardwired to use context, and leveraging this will garner greater results than ignoring it. Our games are about fiction, and using direct links to the fiction enhances our ability to understand them, giving context to the data. These direct links to the fiction can be examples, art, or game mechanics wrapped in setting elements. Without them, the data in the books will have no meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296509/#Comment_296509" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T12:55:45+00:00" title="October 11, 2010 12:55PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2010 12:57PM by Destriarch.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>But surely in that case, the Stats part is well-constructed to teach the system, but poor as a reference, and the Powers section is a good reference but not so hot at teaching players how they operate on their own or together?</blockquote>\nI find it usually works out OK myself, so long as you're careful about the order and layout in which you present the rules. Besides, it's more important for rules to be taught, and more important for ability lists to be easily referenced. If they can't be both at once, it's better that they lean in the direction that suits them best.<br/><br/>You're quite right about teaching by slowly increasing complexity though, I think. That's the way I tend to write my rules sets, along with copious examples along the way. I also prefer to introduce a sample character and use them to explain the rules before I explain how to make your own character, since that means you have the context of the rules to guide you when you do.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296513/#Comment_296513" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T13:14:03+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  1:14PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people like fluff.

Agreed. But how do you define fluff? By my definition, illustrations and some flavor text are no big deal. <br/>But I really don't think that High Nineties style fluff constitutes something that draws people in; it's something that we have experienced historically *as gamers*, of course, but if board games, video games, etc., are any indication, people can only handle so much extra packaging beyond the thing itself. <br/><br/>From my own experience, it seems that having slim little volumes (not just a hallmark of nouveau indie games, but it's been a while since that was anything like the norm) is a great boon, also - it's far less intimidating and requires a lot less of the information-mastery that we can easily expect from fellow nerds.<br/><br/>That all being said, I think there's a design style dedicated to fluff and enjoyment thereof, in its own right. But for me, the point of this thread is to distinguish what fluff is, what to do with it, how/how much to use it, etc., as a person whose tastes lie elsewhere.

People give preference to games that do a horrible job invoking a mood with their mechanics but a fantastic one with their fiction and illustrations and flavor texts... This is why so many people are devoted to games and speak highly of them who at the same time feel real distress about how bad the play actually is at the table. If someone made a cyberpunk game that was just a bunch of text, that was totally un-fun to interact with as text, but when you sat down and did it ot would create awesome Blade-Runner-esque games with consistent fun for everyone, less people would play it than Cyberpunk 2020 or whatever, because RPG Culture wants the rule book to be an activity or an artifact or an art piece almost more than it wants it to be a rulebook... or at least this is something that I've encountered over and over again as a gamer, and there are times when I enjoy pretty books and cool game fiction etc... but that shit should always come second.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296532/#Comment_296532" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T18:24:36+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  6:24PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting discussion.

Setting is the context, the framework, for the players. The setting, to paraphrase Luke Crane, is rules. It has to be designed wight the same concerns as every other aspect of the rules. What's possible? What's hard? How do these people do this thing? If I break a law, what are the consequences I can expect and how do I confront or avoid them?</p>\n<p>Like, if I'm playing in a  fantasy world that looks like Medieval Europe, I'd better be able to understand the social classes of the setting if I'm going to have social interactions. I'd better be able to figure out how to insult someone to have the desired effect. I'd better be able to figure out if the culture uses money. The setting doesn't necessarily have to just give you answers on these things, but it has to give you the tools with which to sort them out in a way that helps you, as a player, to make stuff happen. Those tools can be elements of setting just as easily as they can be procedures. They're all rules. They're all part of System.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296544/#Comment_296544" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T22:17:05+00:00" title="October 11, 2010 10:17PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2010 10:19PM by masqueradeball.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that setting is part of the system, or I guess, I agree that it can be... but a lot of "setting" is really just packaging. For example, calling the D&amp;D spell Fireball. In earlier additions this was meaningful, the players and the GM were encouraged to change the content that emerged in the game based on the knowledge that within the fiction the magic-user was creating a big ball of fire. There were whole Dragon articles about what this could mean in game. In 3e + calling a given attack spell Fireball was essentially meaningless, or almost meaningless, because the designation could not be interpreted from. It did not effect the content arising in play, so that name, to me, is just packaging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296553/#Comment_296553" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T06:25:51+00:00" title="October 12, 2010  6:25AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>... but if board games, video games, etc., are any indication, people can only handle so much extra packaging beyond the thing itself.</blockquote>\nWell, I think that's certainly true in its way, but I also think that video games have more of a tendency to lean in the direction of not enough fluff, with one or two notable exceptions (mostly in the RPG area again). I get bored with most action games very quickly because their plotlines are ineffectively told, predictable and dull. On the other hand, Metal Gear Solid and friends bore me rigid because you hardly get any time for gameplay in between the cutscenes, and what there is doesn't really thrill me once I get to it. But then again, I loved Heavy Rain (that was the right name, wasn't it?) and that was almost 100% fluff, but the story was so engaging and well-executed that I didn't notice. So maybe it's not so much the amount of fluff, as how well the fluff is woven into the rest of the product?<br/><br/>Board games I won't comment on, since I don't like them much and thus have little experience of how much fluff they contain. I also agree that different people like different amounts of fluff, and it's a fool's errand trying to please everyone.

Coca-cola scores differently in blind taste tests and brand-obvious taste tests. (I think it also gets different results based on taste tests based on sipping the product vs. long-term consumption). Since taste is a subjective thing it shouldn't be surprising that a huge array of psychological factors impact it. Since an RPG is heavily influenced by the creative input of the players, the context of the procedures have an impact on play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

We're kind of talking past each other, or not really doing much more than sounding off, otherwise. If that's what you're looking for, cool; I would like to grab hold of something and debate it.</blockquote>\nTo me, fluff is "non-rules" or "inspiration" and crunch is "rules" or "procedures". And there are elements that can fall in-between. <br/><br/>I believe D&amp;D lost a lot of customers for many related and unrelated reasons that started with D&amp;D 3.5 and included moving away from simulation. What percentage? No idea. And it isn't all about what D&amp;D did wrong but also what Paizo did right.<br/><br/>Regarding fluff, look at Paizo's adventure paths. I've heard they have well over 10,000 monthly subscribers! I very much doubt that each subscriber actually uses all their previous adventure path books before they receive new ones. So what do they do with them? <br/><br/>Read them! <br/><br/>But when I was GMing D&amp;D 4E, I only bought the books I absolutely knew I needed because they served no value to me unless I used them. And even then, I could probably just use D&amp;D Insider and skip many of the books all together since I only needed the bare-bone mechanics.                        </div>\n<div

I don't think Paizo or Wizards 100% knows. And I think there are many related and unrelated contributing factors. My sources span from people who work at or used to work at Wizards and Paizo, their freelancers, friends at Barnes &amp; Nobles, Borders, Publishers Weekly, Amazon, and at least 4 different hobby store retailers. It's a small hobby and it's not hard to know a lot of people. That said, even with so many different sources it is impossible to say and I would be highly hesitant to believe a single theory without serious market research backing it up. <br/><br/>Ultimately I don't think 4E being less of a simulation was the only reason it didn't meet expectations (although I think it was a significant one). There was a series of obstacles from 3E being such a large success (D&amp;D was competing with itself), 3.5 causing confusion among both retailers and customers, canceling Dungeons &amp; Dragons magazines, claiming 4E wasn't coming out soon then announcing it was coming out, mocking aspects of 3E in the 4E announcement at Gencon (while 3E was much loved), OGL being replaced by the GSL and essentially killing third party support, Paizo who ran Dungons &amp; Dragons magazines continuing to support 3E and many third party companies sticking with Paizo, game stores excited about Paizo sticking with 3E so they can continue to sell their 3E back stock, not using a  unique art style, the game itself required more effort to play (you can'y just choose to play a fighter where you just roll to hit), the Online Campaign tools advertised in all the 4E core books never coming out, yearly versions of the core books (PHB 1, 2, 3, MM 1, 2, 3, DMG 1, 2), Wizards stopped selling PDFs, the Digital Insider service made it so that you didn't have to buy all the 4E books, the books became fiction / fluff light, feeding into the old fan base's fear that D&amp;D was becoming a mini or card game by requiring the use of minis and selling power cards, fear that D&amp;D was becoming World of Warcraft, constant rules changes &amp; errata, inconsistent marketing messages, giving away less free content on their websites, alienating non-subscribers, major changes in the RPGA (organized play) and I'm sure a lot more I'm forgetting. It's been a very bumpy ride. Not to mention modern day concerns that are affecting all of publishing from competitions from digital games, piracy, retailers closing down, and much more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296628/#Comment_296628" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T16:04:50+00:00" title="October 12, 2010  4:04PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            According to the RPG.Net Lexicon:\n<blockquote>Fluff: Slang for the parts of a RPG book other than the rules--such as setting details, game fiction, history, et cetera.

They just named things like they were fantasy. I have a power called "Divine Retribution" but I can use it with equal impunity against a being diametrically opposed to my god or against a fellow member of the faith? What?

Did D&amp;D ever emulate/evoke/express medieval Europe or Tolkien or Howard or whatever well despite all the artwork and descriptions and names and supporting fiction?<br/><br/>To give an actual example of games that has a lot of setting and situation built in that is not (in my opinion/definition) fuffy/mostly packaging: Castle Falkenstein (and I would include the "novel" in the front as system), Pendragon, Cyberpunk 2020, Legend of the Five Rings, etc...<br/><br/>Final Note on D&amp;D:<br/>What edition of D&amp;D was heavy on fluff or fictional content in the core books?

The short answer is: Pepsi demonstrated that random people on the street liked Pepsi more than Coke (it's sweeter, and therefore more pleasant in the smaller amounts that were in the samples). Coke started actually losing market share, and created New Coke, which caused the greatest controversy of the 1980s (WERE NOT GOING TO DIE IN NUCLEAR FIRE BECAUSE OUR PRESIDENT IS AGGRESSIVE DUE TO ALZHEIMERS NO NO NO LETS TALK ABOUT GRACE JONES INSTEAD SHE IS SO WEIRD HA HA HA OH GOD WERE GONNA DIE). That controversy alone gave Coke back its mindshare; when they reintroduced Coke Classic, they regained their market. Same product.

Absolutely not. You would have heroic fantasy with laser swords instead of regular swords, maybe. You'd call your wizards "Jedi", I suppose. But fundamentally, you'd have the same game, with the same Vance/Tolkein influences, and you'd have to make up rules for starfighters. You still couldn't play Dune, because you couldn't do the politics (Chris Aylott's <em>Dynasties and Demagogues</em> would sure help, though I don't know how compatible it is with 4e). You couldn't do Foundation because all your tools are fighting tools, and "violence is the last refuge of the incompetent". You sure as fuck couldn't do Left Hand of Darkness or Stranger in a Strange Land. And if you took a crack at Rudy Rucker using D&amp;D rules, you'd... well, it would wind up being a trippy joke, so it actually might work out fine.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of assumptions built into the D&amp;D rules, and the "fluff" is the context that tells you what they are.</p>\n<p>(Aside: in my home krewe, back in the late 80s and early 90s, "crunch" was the stuff in RPG books that was what the book was really about. It was where all the neat ideas were. It was the stuff that told you what a Gnog was, and why it was important, or the maps with the evocative little icons, or the guy with all the tattoos that were supposed to tell his life story. I've got White Wolf's first perfect bound publications, in fact, and they're all this kind of thing: an abstract system for making gods. The system doesn't make much sense, but it's supposed to be usable in any RPG. I liked it because it was full of neat ideas about what gods are in fiction, and that, to me was "crunchy". Or "chewy", now that I think back.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296651/#Comment_296651" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T21:25:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2010  9:25PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a lot of assumptions haphazardly strewn about the D&amp;D rules and the fluff is the stuff that distracts you from realizing that its not really good at running anything... look, its got elves, its like Tolkien!

I call such setting material an exercise in itself, and a perfectly valid one, if that's your thing. <br/><br/>My above analysis of Vampire, by the way, is from my perspective as, mainly, an enthusiast of ... here we go... Narrativist play, as opposed to Simulationist play. I used to be way more into reading up on all the latest <i>All My Childer</i> gossip, but that's not my thing any longer, so, for my purposes, it's packaging.<br/><br/>Annnnd now, by my own process here, I'm inclined to agree with Jason - if one gamer's fluff is another gamer's content, I think we should toss the term (at least as a pejorative) and go on our merry way. <br/><br/>/thread over? ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296656/#Comment_296656" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T23:51:52+00:00" title="October 12, 2010 11:51PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2010 2:09AM by masqueradeball.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac,<br/><br/>What?

Should we? </i></blockquote> To the former, I say, yes, the game <i>is</i> the thing, and an interesting concept, explained in the text, will be compelling even if not dressed up in flowery or colorful language. I quite like the blurbs in the ApocaWorld character playbook, but they are not critical (to me) to properly digesting the text. If anything, I think the Skinner could have benefited from a "straight" blurb, rather than the AW-narration style blurb it got; the archetype seems a bit vague to me, as presented. Moves'll clear that up, I guess, but still.<br/>To the latter, I say if we're primarily concerned with a book as a game text, then no, we shouldn't care. Give me slim little volumes that get to the point! A little frou frou is appreciated, if well done, but it isn't essential.<br/>I daresay that the majority of published RPG texts out there are meant, on some greater or lesser level, meant to be coffee-table books, pleasant to thumb through for a few minutes while you wait for the GM to get back from Sbarro, or whatever. To paraphrase Ron Edwards, I say: if you're interested in writing a novel, or a pleasant art-book, consider doing that instead!

However, many people including myself disagree with this.  I appreciate food that looks good, because it adds to my overall enjoyment of the meal.  <br/><br/>For me, game books serve multiple purposes.  First of all, I have to read them.  Reading the book is part of the overall experience of the game.  If it is dull and dry to read the book, that doesn't put me in a good mood to run a fun and colorful game.  Also, I generally play keeping the game books around - which we will often consult (depending on the game).  A good game book should add to the experience of the game by serving as both a reference and as inspiration.  <br/><br/>I tend to prefer a game book which helps me picture the sort of fun and colorful play that it is intended to produce.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296722/#Comment_296722" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T11:34:26+00:00" title="October 13, 2010 11:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the food analogy stands... if we were going to compare gaming to cooking, it seems that the rule book would be the recipe and the play would be everything else, the cooking, the presentation, the eating, hell, even the digestion.

If the recipe had lots of drawing and adjectives describing the ingredients, would that help you make better food?</blockquote>\nYou can draw the analogy various different ways, but I think it does stand.  Many cookbooks are illustrated and well-written in order to explain better the process of cooking.  For example, if I have no idea what a daikon is, it is very helpful to have pictures for how to buy one in an Asian supermarket - and especially what a good ripe daikon looks like as opposed to one that is less flavorful.  Many recipes will suggest frying to a "golden brown" or "lightly seared" - which pictures can convey much better than strict definitions.  Colorful prose description can also help convey what the best ingredients or ideal cooking should look like.  <br/><br/>Stepping out of the analogy for a moment - role-playing games are imaginative experiences.  As such, the pictures and colorful prose have an effect on play.  For example, I could make a game that has the same mechanics as Polaris without having the illustrations or colorful language - but I don't think it would be the same.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>You don't have to read the game book through, like a novel... as a matter of fact I think much of the structure of early book design was that they would be used as references during play.

I agree that description cannot perfectly convey play, but that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be some effort to convey what the designer has in mind.  i.e. What does she intend play to be like - in tone, flavor, and style?  <br/><br/>A resource used in play (like a reference or other play piece) can benefit from color.  For example, it is possible to play Magic: The Gathering with cards that only say the mechanical effect without the name, picture, or color prose.  However, I think it would be a distinctly different gaming experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296790/#Comment_296790" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T21:46:46+00:00" title="October 13, 2010  9:46PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2010 9:51PM by masqueradeball.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never said anything about the Clan Books, I said something about the Clan Novels, and the Clan Books, of course, give you content for play... I mean, seriously, what else are they for. Their style of presentation may or may not be the most effective, but I'm willing to bet your games do not come out like the short fiction vignettes in those books even if the fictional content generated by play does somehow, which I also find doubtful.<br/><br/>As for the "cookbooks have pictures" once again, this does not equate to what I'm talking about... a picture of an ingredient in a recipe that's there to help you better prepare the meal is effectively part of the recipe and not a piece of packaging used to entice you to use the cook book. The same goes for "descriptions" like light brown.<br/><br/>You could totally, through written words, convey what actually happens at the table, maybe not perfectly, but close, its called and example of play, which is an entirely different beast than a piece of prose fiction set within in the same world as the game.<br/><br/>Yes, resource books can benefit from color, of course, of course, but who cares, really. Magic is a good game because it has solid and engaging mechanics, the pictures are just there to help identify the cards and to make interacting with the game pieces more rewarding, it would not be a good game if the art and the "setting" of Dominara were all it had to offer, or if they were primarily what it had to offer, and some very ugly and plain games can be very rewarding to play.<br/><br/>So, once again, this is not a question of whether pretty = good.

It's got great recipes, but it also has a lengthy, charming intro about her experience as a Russian refugee among Americans, Russian kitchens versus American kitchens, how to drink like a Russian, etc.  It's a wonderful cookbook and I wouldn't trade it for a dozen modern cookbooks with photorealistic illustrations of properly browned blinis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296847/#Comment_296847" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T09:11:21+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  9:11AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So as a consumer, I have a totally clear delineation in my head between "fluff" and "crunch." It has nothing to do with setting or rules.<br/><br/>There's rules crunch: Stuff that directly and obviously impacts resolution. <br/><br/>There's rules fluff: Little subsystems that sound totally rad but I never use. Equipment lists, that's seriously fluffy shit right there. <br/><br/>There's setting crunch: Hardcoded situations right there in the world, like social injustices or pending revolutions or whatever. Clan/familial/governmental tensions. Rules of society against which to grind. Pictures of places you can go and people/creatures you might meet. Maps that matter.<br/><br/>There's setting fluff: Utterly unimportant historic shit that doesn't actually provide any context to anything because, well, only the GM is gonna read it. Pictures of places you can't go and people you can't meet. <br/><br/>There's procedural crunch: Everyone participates in the world burning session because that helps create common understanding and investment. You choose the color of your mouse's cape and that helps you visualize your hero. The MC writes love letters to his players after a long break because that helps everyone remember what's going on and lets you progress the situation. <br/><br/>And there's procedural fluff, but IMO this is a highly contentious area about which many experimental-RPG fans are going to disagree. It's probably the most fertile area of design right now. Procedures I have personally found fluffy: The knife thing in MRG. Dance-for-the-GM XP schemes in oldskool D&amp;D (was it good roleplaying? was it good enough? did you engage with my material the way I wanted you to?). <br/><br/>Executive summary: If it provides a useful tool to me in any way, it's crunch. If it's non-useful or just vaguely evocative, it's fluff. Doesn't matter if it's a rule, setting material or a procedure.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296849/#Comment_296849" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T09:18:45+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  9:18AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2010 10:49AM by Peter_Aronson.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>Thats not what I meant to say.

Fluff is part of this, whether fiction or art or even just a convention where the first para always establishes context. Other landmarks include sidebars, diagrams, and tables, which can be pure crunch but be presented in a "fluffy" fashion to imply setting context.<br/><br/>The landmarks are essential to utility, for me anyway, though the degree to which they are fluffed can vary dramatically.

There are multiple ways of approaching something.  One way is to give rules to follow; another way is to provide some examples as inspiration.  I have a ten year old son, for example.  If I hand him a game book full of rules, like Capes or With Great Power..., he is going to drop it like a shot.  However, if I give him a fun superhero comic, chances are fair that he and a friend will be role-playing characters they make up for that setting.  <br/><br/>This crosses over into how games are designed.  My Life With Master has some good examples.  It makes "rules" that you have to set, like specifying the Master as Brain or Beast, and its type as Feeder, Breeder, Collector, or Teacher.  However, these rules don't have any mechanical effect on the game - i.e. by some definitions, they are fluff.  I think they do serve a purpose in setting tone and guiding your imagination.  <br/><br/>This is the same purpose that other inspirational material has in different games - it gives you ideas, but it doesn't change the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296911/#Comment_296911" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T14:02:09+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  2:02PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Destriarch, <br/>I never said that ribbons were bad or that I wanted people to get rid of them, what I'm talking about is PRIORITIZING them.<br/><br/> Paul,<br/>I think we agree entirely here on what fluff is, I guess maybe I'm trying to include some general definition of usefulness v/uselessness, like a utilitarian view of it or something, but generally, I agree.<br/><br/>Peter, <br/>This is a question of what people prioritize in play, its about prioritizing things external to actual play or effective play where effective is defined differently by each individual, and whether or not there is or there is not a general tendency to undermine play in favor of marketable/enjoyable paraphernalia.<br/><br/>Joshua,<br/>Illustrations are a good form of communication, but if the contents of a rule book don't contribute to the procedures of play, how valuable are they?

If you want mood to only come from the rules, then that's fine.  On the other hand, if someone else wants to role-play without formal written rules and have mood come from something else, that can be fine too.  <br/><br/>For example, in my play of Fiasco the mood was heavily influenced by Coen brothers movies.  We used that as our shared source of inspiration, and that guided us in setting the mood for the game.  It's possible to play Fiasco without having seen a Coen brothers movie (or the other sources), but I think the results would be different.  The question is: are Coen brothers movies external or extraneous to Fiasco?  Or are they part of it?  I think the answer is that it's a matter of taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296944/#Comment_296944" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T17:37:53+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  5:37PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But can the mood created by and influenced by the Coen brothers films be seen as something that is a credit to Fiasco as a game system (once again, using system in the widest sense of the word)?

Good art can convey a lot about the setting, the rules, and other things thamay be harder to explain verbally.

Once again, universal agreement is not necessary for a term to be useful... There might be a lot of grey area, but there is nevertheless a definable thing at one end or the other, but my fundamental argument is this: a game's identity is primarily defined by what happens during play and that the content included as the game's rules should be focused on being directly implemented during that play. Having thought about it though, I can see all of those pictures and short stories and what not being thought of as teaching tools, as a way of expressing what it is that the people at the table should be trying to achieve, but it still seems a little dishonest to judge a game by this extraneous (or maybe introductory) content, its like judging the a video game on the cover art and not the graphics in game, and I still feel that the RPG (mainstream?) community seems to value book-as-artifact or art piece OVER book as way of making games happen. Nearly every highly successful (D&amp;D, Vampire, the new War Hammer) game owes a large part of its popularity to the type of play <b><i>promised and implied</i></b> by the art work and fiction, that I think a lot of experience reveals, is not generated by these games...

There's no reason everything has to be direct. If it was completely direct, it would just give you procedural algorithms. But that would be painful to read, and you couldn't figure out what to do with it until the end, and you'd probably give up before you got there. So instead it's in sentences, but those sentences have tone to convey things like, "This is the part where you get what you want" or "This is where you invest in something" or "The consequences of this are severe" or whatever. And if that's written well, it explains not only the procedure, but how to use those procedures. And it probably does that through examples, some of which are extended into scraps of fiction. And some of those scraps of fiction are best expressed through pictures.</p>\n<p>"A vampire woman with tattoos and a leather jacket" doesn't express as much as</p>\n<p><img alt="Tim Bradstreet" src="http://www.idrawdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/23.jpg"/></p>\n<p>That's because some things are, by nature, best expressed visually.</p>\n<p>Once we've got all those images in our minds, we're dealing with a different thing than if we were just dealing in algorithms. We're using the algorithms, of course.

I know that stuff traditionally considered to be fluff can be good, that just because it seems extraneous doesn't mean that it is, and just because it seems essential doesn't mean that it is. Depending on your point of view, the fact that halflings have hairy feet might be more what D&amp;D is about than whether or not, idk, all weapons do 1d6 damage or they all have different dice for damage... but does this mean that games should be judged by things that are essentially external to play. That Bradstreet illustration (which I really like, as an illustrator/cartoonist myself, Bradstreet is like a rock star to me) seems only effective in as much as its a teaching tool to say "this is what were going for," but, and I think a lot of Vampire players would agree with this, the play they want is often undermined by the system Vampire presents, even though the play they want is specifically engendered by all that art and writing about the fictional world of Vampire, and yet, if someone made three pages of text that said "Sit down and do this" and if you did it, good vampire games would happen, would any one care? Would anyone even play it? I think if someone ever did make the "perfect game" it would get swallowed in obscurity unless it could pay for nifty cover art, which is a damn shame and is symptomatic of the fact that gamers (some gamers, from where I'm sitting) prioritize the wrong thing (and by wrong, I don't mean wrong for me, I mean wrong for them, that they make self-destructive decisions).<br/><br/>In short, shouldn't the play be the thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297052/#Comment_297052" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-15T16:17:04+00:00" title="October 15, 2010  4:17PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>if someone made three pages of text that said "Sit down and do this" and if you did it, good vampire games would happen, would any one care?

Role-playing games are not boardgames - they involve a whole lot of open-ended choices based on imagination, like what new characters to add, what plot twists to throw in, and so forth.  The imaginative choices I make are guided by my inspirations for the game.  <br/><br/>Basically, I don't that such a 3-page hypothetical vampire game could exist that didn't depend on external shared knowledge about what vampires are, and what the vampire fiction is like that you're trying for.  If you took someone who had only read the Twilight books, someone who had only read Anne Rice, and someone who hadn't read any vampire novels but had seen the Blade movies - and gave them a 3-page set of raw rules, I think their play would be a mess - which could be improved by the game providing a vision.  A game needs flavor pieces to get people's imaginations on roughly the same page in mood and style.  <br/><br/>The flavor can be provided by what are technically mechanics - like My Life With Master's master creation mechanics - but flavor can also come from agreed source material (especially for licensed works like Mouse Guard or Buffy the Vampire Slayer); or in-game illustrations (Paranoia is excellent for its satirical vision via cartoons); or other fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297062/#Comment_297062" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-15T19:07:43+00:00" title="October 15, 2010  7:07PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess thats a valid point, but since procedures can be anything, I mean, it could say "Step : Define what vampires mean to you and share it with the group" you sorta have that stuff covered.

You can have the players create their own setting as well, which many groups do.  However, I also think it's perfectly reasonable as a consumer for me to buy a game that has a setting already made for me to use.  <br/><br/>Again, I have nothing against preferring games like Toon.  However, I also think that it is reasonable to prefer games with non-rules material, because that material does affect the experience of a game, especially a role-playing game that is full of imagination and imaginative choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297069/#Comment_297069" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-15T21:36:04+00:00" title="October 15, 2010  9:36PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But a setting is part of the rules... at least IMO, I thought that was established... the difference question is whether or not the setting material is something that emerges in play or something that doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13154/fluffy-nonsense-and-who-the-fuck-cares" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13154/fluffy-nonsense-and-who-the-fuck-cares" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13154/fluffy-nonsense-and-who-the-fuck-cares/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13154%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13154%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
