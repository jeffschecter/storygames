You can look up any situation, and find an arbitration process that is compatible with the processes you've used for every other situation.<br/><br/>Most people I've played GURPS with were drawn to that consistent quality, but they also wanted something more: they wanted consistency with the fiction, a fiction that (usually) obeyed real-world physics.  We all got the impression that GURPS was trying to give us that, but our results with it were unimpressive.  Sometimes, outcomes made sense.  Sometimes, they didn't.<br/><br/>All throughout the process of turning to GURPS' system of die numbers and modifiers, we never really honed our judgment of when to employ them.  Basically, we employed them whenever someone cared about an outcome of any fictional action.<br/><br/>I'm just using GURPS as an example to illustrate the following type of game experience:<br/><br/><span style="color: #000099;">Player: "I try to shoot the goblin.  My attack roll is 3d6."<br/><br/>GM: "The goblin is running.  That seems relevant.  I'll look it up.  (Flip.  Flip.)  Okay, he gets +1 die to his 2d6 dodge dice."<br/><br/>Player: "Well, it's dim, I've set up the shot, I'm standing still.  That should penalize his dodge.  (Flip.  Flip.)  Yep, -2 dice for Total Surprise.  He's down to 1d6."<br/><br/>GM: "You're right in his field of vision!  Total Surprise is for... (Flip.  Flip.) ... for sneaking up behind someone!"<br/><br/>Player: "Okay, fine, Partial Surprise.  -1 die.  2d6 total.  Hey, I also have the high ground.  I think that gives a bonus too."<br/><br/>GM: "Really?  (Flip.  Flip.)  It gives a distance bonus for ranged shots.  Not relevant here."<br/><br/>Player: "Does that bonus move my shot to the Point Blank increment?  (Flip.  Flip.)  Ah, guess not."</span><br/><br/>I hate this.  See how much flipping through tables there is?  See how long it takes?  See how the numbers and categories begin to dominate the players' attention, even if they only started out by trying to model the fiction?  Maybe the way the scene's been described, the 3d6 vs 2d6 rolls don't even make much sense!  Consider an alternative:<br/><br/><span style="color: #000099;">Player: "I try to shoot the goblin."<br/><br/>GM: "Okay.  Can he see you?"<br/><br/>Player: "Only if he's looking up.  And looking carefully enough to notice a still figure in the twilight."<br/><br/>GM: "Well, you're moving a bit to track him with your bow."<br/><br/>Player: "True.  Pretty subtle, though."<br/><br/>GM: "Yeah.  Well, if you were in the goblin's situation, you'd want a chance to notice."<br/><br/>Player: "He's as vigilant as us?"<br/><br/>GM: "Well, maybe not quite.  Okay, a small chance.  Let's say 1 in 4?"<br/><br/>Player: "Cool."<br/><br/>GM: (Rolls d4)  "Nope, he never sees you.  You can shoot him."<br/><br/>Player: "Should I bother rolling?"<br/><br/>GM: "Hmm.  Well, it doesn't seem <i>completely</i> foolproof.  Just don't roll two 1s on 2d6."<br/><br/>Player: "Cool."</span><br/><br/>This process is all about making sense of the fiction for the players.  Anyone has the chance to lobby for what makes sense to them.  Dice and numbers may still come into play, but only if fine details become significant (did I shoot the goblin in an armored or unarmored location?).  And there's no delays trying to remember where the "high ground bonus" table is.  I find that playing this way teaches useful habits, allows the flow of imagined events to continue with minimal interruptions, and produces more acceptable outcomes than a refined mathematical "all-purpose" system.<br/><br/>Obviously, there's no opportunity for boardgame-like rules mastery.  Anyone who enjoys that part of GURPS would probably miss that under my system.  But if the only goal is "realistically determine what happens in the fiction as painlessly as possible", I think my way is hands-down better.<br/><br/>Now, there's a lot of system encoded in the above example.  Consensus doesn't always happen by accident.  But I think it's pretty easy to learn how to get on the same page with your fellow players if that's what you're there to do.

Cartoons!<br/><br/>But I can only view the first two. Is that because they're not done? [Edit: they work now!]<br/><br/>Also, Dave's cartoons are nearly photorealistic. If you're trying to meet him for a date at Dreamation.<br/><br/>2. "Did I shoot the goblin in an armoured or unarmoured location?" That's one of the main things I remember from my days playing GURPS. Especially 4th Edition: people just kept getting shot in the crotch. We had a master sniper character (in a military game), and out of 20 targets he took down, 18 shots hit them in the crotch. Well, at least he got a damage multiplier...<br/><br/>3. I remember my attempt to reconcile the aimed-for goal of <i>The GURPS Promise</i> and actual working gameplay was to simplify the rules into "chunks" which were easier to judge. More grainy resolution, in other words. So I took to playing Fudge and similar games, with lists of guidelines and things like that to make all kinds of "realistic" decisions very easy to make on the fly. In the end, though, it all came down to trusting the GM. Which meant the mechanics were just there to make decisions easier for me as GM (I wanted to be surprised by outcomes, too!), not any kind of go-to set of rules. <br/><br/>But, yeah, simplifying things so you can take the fiction into account is a good way to go for this sort of thing. Kind of like making characters freeform (i.e. just write any trait values, etc, you think fit the character) inevitably turned out to be more "realistic" (for your given genre, etc) than trying to carefully balance ability costs and so on.<br/><br/>I was never able to get the kind of gameplay out of that--the kind that's consistent and reliable and doesn't take one person (usually the GM) pulling the whole train down the hill. I'm looking forward to seeing how you tackle this (or, rather, to KEEP seeing how you tackle this) challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257119/#Comment_257119" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T15:06:41+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  3:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>"See how there can't ever be an implausible result?

How do the social roles of the players play into the way trust, etc, works at the table? For instance, it sounds like you're always (or very often) the GM for these games. Do you think the dynamic you guys have worked out would be as solid if another one of the players took over as GM, in the same style? What about any one of the players? Or is there a strong foundation of, "Dave's done this right before, and we trust his expertise, so we're going along with it"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257127/#Comment_257127" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T15:41:43+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  3:41PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, have you played Burning Wheel?<br/><br/>Also: In your first example, I thought the player's character had a gun.

Or, at least, making things smoother at the table.  Certainly, there are times when Burning Wheel goes for very fine resolution, but one of the game's strengths is the way it gets to what's important in play.  I mean, I'm looking at the example situation and wondering, "Why is this even roll?  What's interesting about success or failure here?"  (Although, it is a scene indicative of games like GURPS or D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>I love the idea of weighing numerous factors on each roll in the service of verisimilitude, and that success and failure are on the line every step of the way.  But, man, I'm too old to play that way anymore.<br/><br/>Also, Lee, I think you're on to something with the issues you identify in that first post; "formalized mechanics vs. consensus mechanics" is interesting to me in particular.  I don't, however, have anything to add to that at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257149/#Comment_257149" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T22:55:45+00:00" title="February 18, 2010 10:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GURPS players I know don't look through the book for tables.

Also interesting, because the Fudge dice can rarely (once every 81 rolls, statistically) exceed that maximum and minimum, in which case you can go "Oh, shit! What's even worse than the worst possible outcome we envisioned?" And something fun inevitably comes up.<br/><br/>The nice thing about this method is that, with a group that's established a strong trust and a strong image of the fiction, you can roll for whatever and whenever, you get lots of unpredictable outcomes, but never anything game-breaking. The dice won't kill your character at the "wrong time" unless the group is willing for that to be an outcome in that situation. So, no getting killed by a house cat that swipes at your hand with a claw.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite>I mean, I'm looking at the example situation and wondering, "Why is this even roll?  What's interesting about success or failure here?"  (Although, it is a scene indicative of games like GURPS or D&amp;D.)</blockquote>\nIf I understand Dave correctly, the interest in this type of play is not in success or failure (at least in some overarching thematic sense). It's merely about fleshing out the fictional situation. "The goblin doesn't notice! Cool!" "The goblin is aware? We need a different plan!" That one roll is just throwing some fun into narration, not a major turning point.\n<blockquote><br/>I love the idea of weighing numerous factors on each roll in the service of verisimilitude, and that success and failure are on the line every step of the way.  But, man, I'm too old to play that way anymore.<br/></blockquote>\nMy sentiments exactly! I always wanted to play like this, but in practice it always either fell a little flat or just moved SOOOO slowly... I feel too old for it, too, now. But I'd love to sit in on your group sometime, Dave, to see how you guys do it. In many ways, it's every gamer's unrealized dream.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite>Also, Dave (Berg), what's up with "abstraction?"  A roleplaying game is already an abstraction, right?</blockquote>\nDave's talking about abstraction as in: mechanical gamepieces, numbers, etc, that don't exist in the gameworld. "Cues", by Vincent Baker's terms. So we resolve directly from the fiction as much as possible. E.g. "I jump across the river!" "It's 20' across, you can't make it." Done. Or: "You said there was a log off to the side!" "Yeah." "Is it 20' long?" "Yeah, it's one hell of a long log." "OK, so I drop it across the river." "OK!" Done. No stats, no dice, no rolling. Chance of failure or success is not about whether it's a meaningful challenge, or whether it's thematically significant. It's just "what would happen", as much as possible. So I think Dave is asking, "then why need the 'game' parts of the system?"<br/><br/>However, in this example he's combined with by-concensus-on-the-fly abstraction (how about we call it 1-in-4?). So, it's definitely still there. I'm guessing Dave's goal is to eliminate that as much as possible, though.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to more in this thread, especially once Dave gets back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257492/#Comment_257492" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T20:11:22+00:00" title="February 21, 2010  8:11PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2010 8:17PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa!

This sounds very similar to a lot of the negotiation we would  do in our long-term improvised system Ars Magica games. It has the advantage of also being able to call in the real world knowledge of all the players (frex, how long does it take before an untreated wound goes septic?) and let's people bring in things that are much more subtle but that feed in to really feeling something in a game. Like the comment:"Yeah. Well, if you were in the goblin's situation, you'd want a chance to notice." <br/><br/>Do you use this process in Delve? Or elsewhere? A drawback to it can be that there needs to be a commitment to *want* to have conversations like this. In our games, having long drawn-out conversations about the world and culture and how it affected situations was a feature of the game, because that was what we were interested in. It could get cumbersome as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257714/#Comment_257714" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T19:42:42+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  7:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so\u2014<br/><br/>I finally got to play Delve at Dreamation this weekend!!!!  Highlight of the con for me.<br/><br/>I'm supah-wicked-mad-tired right now, so this may come out a little incoherent.  Gonna aim for bullet points but believe me when I say, I got essays to write on this amazing game Dave has created.<br/><br/>-It's not that we're going from Cloud to Cloud with no Boxes at all, it's that you don't want the Boxes to be visible to the players.  I agree with this to a certain extent, BUT, your main concern is really that players never gain any knowledge of the *setting* not available to the characters.  Knowing how the dice work wouldn't ruin your "congruence of knowledge" goal.<br/><br/>-Half-hidden Boxes are worse than fully-explained Boxes, hence my dislike of being told to roll dice but not knowing what the possible range of outcomes would be.  In fact, I think it swings too far in the wrong direction--now I as a player am *less* well-informed than my character about what's going on.  (I have a feeling it's going to take some convincing to get you to believe me about this, but it's really true.)<br/><br/>-I'm in favor of any and all die-rolling being done behind the GM screen.<br/><br/>-All other combat stuff aside, your hit location chart needs to be a bell curve, not a line.<br/><br/>-You seriously, seriously need to try Riddle of Steel\u2014not proposing you adopt it whole-cloth, just that stealing a few small bits from it would improve your game's combat system immensely.<br/><br/>-How does chargen work in the actual game?  Cuz' I think it should work exactly the way it did at the Con.  Choose from one of four basic templates, fill in the important personality bits to personalize, and go.<br/><br/>-We need to talk character advancement but not here in this thread.<br/><br/>-Back on topic, more or less: For a campaign, you're going to need to be willing to spend a fair amount of time explaining stuff, laying ground rules, even explaining a lot of meta-stuff and social contract stuff about how the game works.  You're going to need to be even more careful about this stuff than in most campaign set-up sessions, because you're going to be (rightly) really reluctant to go over that stuff once the game starts\u2014too much risk of the GM accidentally talking out-of-game about the setting.<br/><br/>-Ritual phrases good.  Overlapping ritual phrases ("I look" and "I look for") bad.<br/><br/>-Am I right in thinking that the adventures will get more "out there" (both geographically and in terms of magic level) as the game progresses?<br/><br/>-Watch the calendar!  Time should pass.  Look to Mouse Guard's seasons thing.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257753/#Comment_257753" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T01:41:44+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  1:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 1:49AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A number of people here have mentioned the downsides of discussing the fiction to form consensus.  The main ones are (#1) too long distraction from play, (#2) too frequent distraction from play, and (#3) vehement disagreement.<br/><br/>A primary purpose of the cartoons is to <i>show</i> how to avoid this.  As far as being able to <i>tell</i> how to avoid this, I am inelegant at best.  But, here goes:<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> - too long distraction from play</b><br/>If your group enjoys discussing physics and setting features and history etc., and doesn't mind using play time for that purpose, then there's no problem.  If your group enjoys discussing these things but regrets using play time for that purpose, the solution is to stay focused on what's at stake in the fiction -- can <i>this character</i> pull himself over <i>this wall</i> -- rather than getting caught up in anecdotes, theory, and calculation.  Beyond that, the same rules for avoiding vehement disagreement apply and will help speed things up.  Finally, if your group has no interest in discussing physics etc., you should just go for visuals and decide on the basis of who can imagine what.  (Objectivity is unnecessary.  If an entire group of players can somehow comfortably visualize something that a physics professor knows to be impossible, that's fine -- they shouldn't care about that professor.)<br/><br/>The cartoons may take a while to read, but they represent mere seconds of real time.  Also, though they represent optimal player <i>attitudes</i>, they do show worst-case <i>first-try performance</i> -- play will go much faster and require less discussion if the GM doesn't say "7 feet" to describe something too high to jump and grab.<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> - too frequent distraction from play</b><br/>A lot of people who are drawn to playing this way enjoy minutiae.  Thus, I am lazy about picking examples that are the most compelling -- I just go with stuff that <i>could</i> happen, not stuff that I assume everyone <i>must</i> care about.  Resolving the fiction in this style of play is no different than in any other style, in that you cover what you care about, and skip over what you don't care about.  In Delve specifically, I encourage players to skip boring stuff by moving a pacing dial to "summary" mode.<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> - vehement disagreement</b><br/>The key to avoiding vehement disagreement is to strive for mutual plausibility, not perfection.  Don't come up with the one thing that makes <i>most</i> sense to you and dig in your heels -- instead, allow for the full range of outcomes that make <i>any</i> sense to you.  If everyone else does the same, you <i>will</i> find overlap.  The <i>instant</i> you find an overlap, stop!  You are done.  Do not whittle and whittle in hopes of finding the one perfect answer.<br/><br/>If I think torch light most likely illuminates 30 feet and you think torch light most likely illuminates 60 feet, it doesn't matter who's right as long as we both agree that torch light <i>could</i> illuminate 45 feet.  We can both imagine it, so that's the way it is.<br/><br/>Respect other people's "not plausible" calls, and don't call "not plausible" yourself unless you have to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257754/#Comment_257754" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T01:43:25+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  1:43AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 1:43AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though I can't begin to address <i>all</i> of Deliverator Matt's excellent points yet, I will say that I agree with him about the need for introductory communication on these matters.  In my experience, playing in the manner I'm describing does <i>not</i> happen by accident.  I've generally seen forms of it evolve over years of going through trial and error with the same groups of people.  So, starting up a new campaign and telling people "play like this!" is uncharted territory for me.  The cartoons are one attempt to facilitate that, and some version of them will be in the "how to play" section of the Delve rulebook.  I'm looking for other ways to teach these skills too.  Some memorable phrases like "say yes or roll dice" would be a godsend.  A few notes in that direction:<br/><br/>Can the fiction tell you yes or no, or only maybe?<br/>If only maybe, roll dice.<br/><br/>(YES comes from player expertise.<br/><br/>NO comes from player inability to envision.)<br/><br/>No one is perfect at describing the fiction.  Revise when you have to.*  <br/><br/>If something threatens your suspension of disbelief, try to fix that.  <br/>If you can't fix it, say so.<br/><br/>Look, look for, try to judge, vet, refine, act.<br/><br/>Verify assumptions when they matter.<br/><br/>*<sup>The fiction itself isn't being revised, just the reporting of it.  Yes, this is self-brainwashing, but it's constructive.</sup> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257796/#Comment_257796" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T06:22:55+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  6:22AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Teataine, <br/><br/>Regarding Vincent's Otherkind dice:<br/>Plausible outcomes are easier in some cases than others.

That commercial level part mmay not be something you care about because of a desire for money, but the side effect of the game conccepts not being picked up would seem frustrating.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So, okay, but what is <b>this </b>game about?</span><br/>I don't mean <i>Delve</i> specifically. I like the conclusions you seem to be coming to, and I like your cartoons illustrating the methods a ton.<br/><br/>It seems like you're poking towards technique stuff that Prof Barker ( with his Tekumel campaign, if rumors are true) and Matrixgamer, and some other folks have also explored. Basically, a group can have a really great game, maybe one even more locally-defined simmy, by way of really simple on-the-fly negotiatyion than by way of more complicated/involved processes.<br/><br/>Cool. I very much believe this myself, incidently.<br/><br/>But, now that that concept is in place, what else is there? Like, what else do you put together that makes the game tick? I mean, you've sorta just taken the part that makes up the bulk of the page count of most games, even indie ones, and chucked it on the trash heap (awesome!).<br/><br/>[Edited to add: IIRC, you, David B, also made up a variable scene/time arc tool-thingie.

I couldn\u2019t. <br/><br/>So I gave up trying and implemented a style of play similar to the one here. I got rid of all of the difficulty and modifier charts and instead turned to group consensus. I set the challenge and suggest a difficulty but then the players could adjust the difficulty up or down or declare a challenge an automatic success or failure based on what we knew or thought we knew to be realistic. <br/><br/>The problem is reality isn\u2019t perception (sometimes what people think is reality is based on what they saw on a TV show!). Even an FBI agent doesn\u2019t know everything about law and the computer security expert didn\u2019t know everything about hacking. We even occasionally replaced flipping through a Gurps book with using Google on a laptop. And even experts in a relevant field were sometimes wrong. Or experts in the same field couldn\u2019t agree. Or there were way too many variables that results could swing unpredictably to extremes (a common example being one person dying from a seemingly non lethal knife wound while someone else walking away after being shot 7 times). And sometimes negotiation took longer than looking up a difficulty on a chart.  <br/><br/>I decided to use my experience running office meetings to find a middle ground. <br/><br/>Player describes their intent. I introduce an obstacle. They describe their action and build a pool of d6s to roll. I set the initial difficulty and build a pool of d6s to oppose them.<br/><br/>Then everyone else, without negotiation, can help either side by simply saying why and sliding a single d6 to the appropriate pool. It also became a way of co-authoring the fiction. When sliding forward a d6, you explain why by describing \u201cand this\u2026\u201d or \u201cbut that\u2026\u201d without contradicting what was already established or understood. And real life experts could slide forward two d6s and give two separate reasons for it. <br/><br/>It actually worked really well. We weren\u2019t playing Shadowrun anymore but it was a fast compromise. <br/><br/>We later changed the rules so that there was an advantage to testing against a high difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the quicker your skills advanced (ala Burning Wheel). So no one felt bad about using their real life knowledge to make tests harsh if it matched people\u2019s real life expectations. <br/><br/>That said, we still had unpredictable results. 2 dice would occasionally beat 6. And just like the example where a person could die from a seemingly non fatal cut but survive being shot several times, we would use it as an opportunity to explain how that could happen. The gap between expectations became an opportunity for creativity. And since everyone helped weigh the initial odds, people rarely felt disappointed. <br/><br/>This method also didn\u2019t always lead to the most dramatic results. But it fit the play style of this specific group who couldn\u2019t watch TV shows about their areas of expertise where drama overruled reality. Me, I\u2019m all about the drama! But I also like to please my players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257816/#Comment_257816" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T07:29:13+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  7:29AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>K-Bob,<br/>You're quite right that I'm jettisoning a lot of typical RPG book content -- and along with it, a lot of the "game" aspect that so many folks enjoy learning, manipulating and mastering.

It's just that I see a strong connection between the object being something for sale, and the spread of the concept.)<br/><br/>Again, I'm thinking of the example of your scene scope arc tool thingie.

It became fun in itself! The side benefit was it also became a method for staying within the fiction without a lot of meta talk (since you didn't have to ask questions out of character or negotiate) and encouraged everyone to help flesh out the scene together. We also had sessions with very few dice rolls. It's just that when there was a die roll, everyone was often quick to contribute if they had an opinion of what was realistic to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257825/#Comment_257825" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T07:57:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  7:57AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 8:03AM by komradebob.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>"Hey Mr. GM- let's go sideways for a while!"?</blockquote>Huh? Whuzzat mean?<br/><br/>Hmm. How to describe...<br/><br/>Okay, howzabout some really out-of-date AP type stuff.<br/><br/>Back in ye olden days of dungeon crawling, I'd tend to run premade dungeon modules. Usually, my players and I had soem sort of basic, proto-agreement in place that they would take the hook and go into the dungeon.<br/><br/>But, we also had soem understanding that I would also have some give on letting them pursue their own interests, sometimes very quirky ones related pretty much directly to whatever they'd come up with for their character. <br/><br/>It wasn't super formal, just handshake type understanding: They'd go bash some orcs and steal loot in my dungeon, then go back to town and chase the bar maid or negotiate with the merchants or work on getting more stuff built on their super secret base or whatever.<br/><br/>Basically, to me, going sideways just means that second bit: A way of indicating tot the Gm that the players want a little self-directed out take time from the main thrust of things. Spidey needs a little time with Aunt Mae or Mary Jane. The X-Kids need a pick up game of superpowered baseball. <br/><br/>It's little character development time that's really important to the fun, but isn't really like the more directly character centered narrativist games.<br/><br/>Your scene scope/time arc made me think about it, especially since, IIRC, you let players place the token for scope themselves. So, in that case, if they want to slow things down to bullet-time, they just move the token down there. If they want to get broad strokes, say to cover a longish journey quickly, they moe it way down to the other end.<br/><br/>I was trying to think of something similar that could be done with the adventure as a whole. Like, hrm, they've just completed some sort of confrontation, but then one of the players decides to moe the token over to "Personal scene/side-quest" area, indicationg that they want that to be the next item of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257827/#Comment_257827" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T08:03:01+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  8:03AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 8:05AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

I like that!<br/><br/>It sounds like a nice hybrid of SG style player direction of play with a more traditional style of "while the game is on, we're in character first and foremost".<br/><br/>Plus, it seems like a nifty way for the players to offer challenge/adersity to a GM, something that doesn't get talked about in a positive sense very often.<br/><br/>Side question:<br/><br/>From the cartoons and this thread, I haven't gotten the impression that players give much input into negative possibilities/outcome complications. They seem very much in team mode even at the meta level. How common is it in practice for the players to give possible negative outcomes to events? It seems like most of that is still on the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257833/#Comment_257833" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T08:21:57+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  8:21AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has actually happened:<br/><br/>Player One: "I'm going to jump over the pit and grab onto the rope!"<br/><br/>Player Two: "Yay!

Hell, this is why *most* games have so many more pages devoted to combat than to other things, even games that are ostensibly about things other than fighting and killing (cough oWoD cough)\u2014thing is, Delve really *isn't* about fighting and killing things, it's just that combat does in fact need to happen sometimes for fictional plausibility reasons\u2014but it needs to be able to happen in a way that a) doesn't completely break the feel of the rest of Delve, and b) doesn't deprotagonize the player (a real risk when the Boxes are hidden and the player only has access to the Clouds).<br/><br/>Hmm, there's something interesting there in that last paragraph, right when I talked about "fictional plausibility."  It's so easy to quickly agree that, yeah, the only really plausible outcome here is that there will be a fight.  But it's so hard to agree on what the actual outcome of that fight is, for a host of history-of-roleplaying and social reasons.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258079/#Comment_258079" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T09:29:56+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  9:29AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I've got to chime in with Dan H. here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>In theory, he could say, "It was 7 feet, but now I want it to be 9."  But instead, because of the priority you quoted, he says, "It was always 9 feet, but I described it wrong."  The world remains real-seeming as best it can.</blockquote>\nI'm curious about this, because it's something I've struggled with myself in gaming. If you have (say) four players at a table with the GM, and the GM realizes he's described a wall as 7' tall instead of 9', there's a disconnect between what's been established and what the GM is imagining. So, the GM (in this example) is correcting an earlier statement in order to maintain the integrity of the fiction he's imagining in his head.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, though: in order to maintain the integrity of his vision, those four other people suddenly have to break theirs. They've been smoothly and happily been going along for the last half hour (or however long), imagining this town full of 7' tall houses. Suddenly, they need to break that imagery and replace it with 9' tall houses. But isn't the whole game supposed to promote the group's immersion (which I would assume is more important for the players than the GM, especially given the hidden die rolls, etc)? So, why is it better in this case for one person (the GM) to maintain their vision and four others to break theirs, than for one (the GM) to adjust, subtly, invisibly, without breaking game flow for the other four?<br/><br/>(Now, yes, sometimes the detail will be an important one, vital to the integrity of many other fiction details, but just as often, as in this case, those details are NOT that vital and could easily be either way--7' or 9', no biggie.)<br/><br/>In other words, I'm curious if your design goals aren't a bit biased by being a Delve GM and never a Delve player.<br/><br/>Looking forward to your thoughts on this one!<br/><br/>(Also, I want to repeat my recommendation that your "pacing dial" needs to be tattooed onto your forehead or implanted onto your chest in order to run Delve properly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258083/#Comment_258083" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T09:36:55+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  9:36AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (On hit locations, from my "fiction-first" Fudge-playing days:)<br/><br/>The trick we developed went like so: the GM considers the most likely angle of the attack. It could be "I dunno, anywhere on the target", or something more like, "OK, you're slightly above him and swinging down with a sword, so it's going to be somewhere on the left torso, from above and off to the right."<br/><br/>If more detail is needed, the GM rolls a single Fudge die (+, 0, or -) for vertical deviation. So, for the GM's envisioned "possible range" or struck areas, a "+" would mean "OK, the blow is on the top end of this possible range". In other words, you take the envisioned area and mentally divide it into three vertical slices. A "+" is the top slice (maybe above the shoulder, nearer the neck, in this situation), a "0" is the middle slice, and a "-" is the bottom slice (maybe the target's right arm, around the elbow?). <br/><br/>Then, if more detail is needed, roll another Fudge die for horizontal position of the blow, in much the same way.<br/><br/>If more detail is needed, you can keep rolling, "zooming in" each time. It's pretty quick in practice. So, a shot from a rifle at a standing man:<br/><br/>Roll 1: "-". Ok, it's the bottom third of the figure, thigh or below. Left, right, or middle?<br/>Roll 2: "+". Okay, left side. How high along the leg?<br/>Roll 3: "0". Middle of the range? That's a bullet to the left knee.<br/><br/>That takes just a few seconds of consideration, no longer than looking up a chart. And it's adaptable to any situation (which is difficult with a pre-designed table). It's kind of like designing a perfectly-suited hit location table for every specific situation on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258084/#Comment_258084" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T09:38:56+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  9:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Also, I want to repeat my recommendation that your "pacing dial" needs to be tattooed onto your forehead or implanted onto your chest in order to run Delve properly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </blockquote>\nThat pacing dial is just dead-sexy, isn't it?<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out a way to combine that concept somehow with a game that uses a tabletop set up and minis.

I don't know that.  Personally, I have never played in a game where the methods of fortune resolution (roll a d6? a d4? flip a coin? draw a card?) were ad-libbed.  Heck, I've never even played a game where a set method (roll a d6) was mapped to outcomes in a negotiated-out-loud way ("should it take a 5 to hit in this situation, or just a 4?  does a 3 get you anything at all?").<br/><br/>Paul,<br/>Having your hand on the zoom lens while resolving is fucking sweet!  At Dreamation, Deliverator Matt and I had just started a conversation about usng the pacing dial during combat.  But we didn't figure out what that would look like.  Having a repeatable "zoom, roll, hone" action sounds pretty elegant!  This even opens up shit like sliding a blade betwen armor plates!  Which is something you usually can't control, and is extremely unlikely, but totally should exist somewhere on the menu of possibilities.

These techniques are what they are, and they can be used for good or for awesome. But people have to talk about them and examine them, and stop writing them off as "Rule Zero." All that does is stifle discussion, which in turn stifles innovation.<br/><br/>(Sorry if I sound a bit hostile. It's not directed at you, it's directed at the fact that there are preconceived notions about what "Rule Zero" means and that they're prejudicially maligned without examination.)

class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>They've been smoothly and happily been going along for the last half hour (or however long), imagining this town full of 7' tall houses. Suddenly, they need to break that imagery and replace it with 9' tall houses. But isn't the whole game supposed to promote the group's immersion (which I would assume is more important for the players than the GM, especially given the hidden die rolls, etc)? So, why is it better in this case for one person (the GM) to maintain their vision and four others to break theirs, than for one (the GM) to adjust, subtly, invisibly, without breaking game flow for the other four?</blockquote>You are 100% right about my goals and priorities.  However, your suggested solution is incompatible with my experience.<br/><br/>First, let me say that revision only happens when the difference <i>matters</i>.  The GM isn't going around re-detailing the setting <i>just</i> to get the color right.<br/><br/>If the <i>only</i> impact of wall height is how the walls look in our imaginations, then yes, I'm with you, the GM should adjust the visuals in his head to match what's in the players' heads.<br/><br/>However!  The "we care about the integrity of the setting" and "we often base decisions on the fine details of the setting" crowd has a long history.  And that history has a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> predator.  And that predator is "GM described it wrong, so now the world is broken."  <br/><br/>The real problem with 7-foot walls is that they don't fit in the setting.  You wouldn't be able to stand up inside such a building.  If the GM rolls with the nonsensical description in the first instance ("Let's not rock the boat, I'll let them climb the wall and have their rooftop chase."), the world shatters in the second instance, like so:<br/><br/><span style="color: #000066;">GM: On entering the house, you see Bob standing there.<br/><br/>Player 1: How high's the ceiling?<br/><br/>GM: Bob's tall.  The ceiling's a foot or so over his head.  I guess 7 feet.<br/><br/>Player 1: Wait, this has the standard thatch roof?  The super thick stuff?<br/><br/>GM: Yeah.<br/><br/>Player 1: Then from outside, to get up top, it's at least 9 feet.<br/><br/>GM: I guess so.  Yes.<br/><br/>Player 1: So that chase scene couldn't have happened.<br/><br/>*crash!*</span><br/><br/>Since the GM is unlikely to be able to predict when contact with a broken piece of the setting will arrive, it's better to hedge his bets and do everything he can to get it right the first time it's meaningfully interacted with.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the GM should be held to a standard of always covering every base on his own.  Delve's going to have a lot of setting info that will hopefully help the GM develop some common sense for how stuff works.  In the worst-case scenario, you can always go, "No, the chase happened, let's just say there was a ladder you went up," but man, that's a slippery slope.  If it becomes anything close to a pattern, our concrete imagined setting turns to gauze and bumpers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258149/#Comment_258149" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T12:05:19+00:00" title="February 24, 2010 12:05PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11587&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Combat thread</a> is up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258192/#Comment_258192" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T13:57:53+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  1:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2010 2:16PM by komradebob.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall: No offense taken, and fair point about the terminology.<br/><br/>David Berg:<br/>I've actually ad-libbed or partially ad-libbed that kind of outcome on a number of occasions. Maybe it was just more common for me as a kid in the mid/late 80s. The people I gamed with seemed to be pretty okay with it, especially in those circumstances where a real game system wasn't handy and we wanted to roleplay.<br/><br/>If it was  a case of just myself and kids from my hometown who I'd taught to play doing it, I guess it would be pretty easy to chalk up to some sort of cargo cult type thing. But I got to college, met other folks who wanted to and had gamed before and we did the same sort of thing with success until real rulebooks could be obtained. If figure that means that a similar sort of ad-libbed mechanical creation was fairly standard at the time.<br/><br/>Quick follow up question, David:<br/>How do you work in uncommon or even rare outcomes that might be interesting?

That's why I coupled it with a Pool-style economy in my game <i>Land of Nodd</i>. But that's too meta-gamey for <i>Delve</i>.<br/><br/>There are simple things you could do, though, something like:<br/><br/>Name goal, decide on dangers, as usual, as per "Otherkind dice". Alter the charts a little bit, like so:<br/><br/>1-5: You don't get your goal/danger comes true<br/>6-10: You achieve your goal/avoid the danger altogether<br/><br/>If you're in a ideal situation for what you're doing, lots of circumstances in your favour, roll d10s.<br/>If you're in an OK situation, good and bad circumstances both, roll d8s.<br/>If you're in a lousy situation, roll d6s.<br/><br/>The numbers aren't quite right, but you get the idea. Using something more fine-grained, like cards, can let you get more range of outcomes.<br/><br/>If that's still too meta-gamey, you can let the players allot their efforts <i>before</i> seeing the outcome, like "for you highest priority: draw three cards, for the others draw two, for your lowest priority, or the thing you're least prepared for, draw one card".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258224/#Comment_258224" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T15:01:49+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  3:01PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, yeah, having some general categories for degrees of success (or fortuitousness) seems helpful.

However, I still think my point stands. You have to go case-by-case, and sometimes one way is better and sometimes the other. But I find it odd that a game so focused on immersion and the integrity of the fiction is also (as far as I can tell) prioritizing the GM's "consistent vision" over that of the players, who are really the ones trying to "immerse" and live inside the fiction.<br/><br/>My experience (so far, of course) has been that I've only fully been able to enjoy this style of gaming as a GM, for precisely this reason, which is why I ultimately gave up on it. How much have you played in this style (as a non-GM)? How has that experience gone for you?<br/><br/>Also, the thing Matt/Deliverator says about the odds of the dice being hidden from the players is right on, and another point along the same lines.<br/><br/>I wonder, though, if that's an inescapable double bind.

You roll, and you see that you fought Superbly (say). Yes! <br/><br/>But the GM also rolls for the other dude, and can say, "he kicks your ass". <br/><br/>In the Otherkind example, there could be varying target numbers of some sort. To make it work easily and seamlessly, you could incorporate props. For instance, with the Otherkind cards example, you (the GM) also have three index cards. One is "hard", and shows a Jack, say. One is "medium" and show a Nine. One is "easy" and shows a Six. You place those cards face down on the table, pointing to each one: "this is your goal to catch the dude; this is the danger you get shot while running; this is the chance you're seen by the goblin". <br/><br/>Then the player places his cards on top of those, and you reveal all at once.

It really, really isn't.  <br/><br/>The priority is the players' immersion (you know what "immersion" means here, so I'm not going to define it).  That's only possible if they:<br/>a) pretend that there is an objective fictional reality, and<br/>b) have a means through which to view that reality<br/><br/>The GM is that means.  He's the players' magic goggles.  Sometimes the goggles break, and the world looks funky, and you need to recalibrate them.<br/><br/>If you say, "No, I want whatever I see throught the goggles to become true, even if the goggles are broken," then you're not interested in this style of immersion.<br/><br/>It's not about making the GM happy.  It's about making the players happy over the course of extended play.  Maybe that results in a few jarring moments.  But it's better to accept those moments, and to work on minimizing them through goggles-tuning*, than to have a gameworld that clearly isn't real because it can't decide whether people can stand up inside their houses.<br/><br/>*i.e. textual help for the GM + practice                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258264/#Comment_258264" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T16:18:54+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  4:18PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually refer to the GM as the "Gameworld Microscope" in the Delve text.

I've had similar thoughts, particularly for one-on-one games (1 GM/1 Player) which often take a more collaborative bent. I've play tested it a few times, and it works out well.<br/><br/>Here's a summary of my approach...<br/><br/>Characters don't have stats, but are instead built out of aspect-like "facts" that detail their abilities and typical behaviors within the narrative. PC's have a character sheet with a list of facts, while NPC's can be detailed to whatever level is appropriate. The genre, style of play, setting, etc. also contribute their own facts, though often those facts are just understood rather than documented. A challenge involves a bit of negotiation, where the GM sets a difficulty, and the player accepts or makes a proposed adjustment based on factors that the GM perhaps didn't consider.<br/><br/>For example, a PC has crept to within arrow-shot of an orc camp. There's a lone orc sentry walking the edge of the camp, and the PC has managed to remain undetected.<br/><br/>Player: "I want to take a shot at the sentry. I'll be aiming for his head, in order to put him down without a sound."<br/><br/>GM: "Okay. Your character is great with a bow, but you're at a fairly long range and it's a moonless night. It'll be tough. I'd say 50%."<br/><br/>Player: "I've got plenty of time to take aim. Seems like I should have better than a 50/50 chance."<br/><br/>GM: "True. Assuming you're taking your time, I think 60% is reasonable." <br/><br/>Player: "I want to introduce a fact (pays a fact point). Let's say the sentry strolls over by a fire for a moment to warm his hands. I'll wait for that and use the light to help my aim."<br/><br/>GM: "Okay, that's worth another shift. Let's finalize it at 70%. With a close miss, you'll hit him but it won't be fatal and he's going to make some noise."<br/><br/>Player: "Sounds Good" (grabs the percentile dice)<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>In play, things typically move between micro and macro level exchanges, even in the midst of a single combat. It's about zooming on what feels suspenseful, or cool, or important to the story.<br/><br/>What I like about this approach is that it bundles lots of complex rules for "reality simulation" into common sense and arbitration. Using the percentage system allows you to just shift up or down by 10% to represent new facts, and everyone understands what a 70% chance means (not everyone gets the impact of trying to roll a 10 on a 2d6 versus something like 7).<br/><br/>I haven't dealt with hit locations except as part of descriptions and outcomes. Wounds are a consequence of taking risks and blowing the die roll, and have an impact on relevant actions (as a negative fact) if they aren't attended to.<br/><br/>Anyway .. you seem to be formalizing what I've been ad-hoc'ing , which is cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258420/#Comment_258420" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T07:47:37+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  7:47AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Biggerboat.

That would remove the illusion of the Gameworld Microscope, which we don't want.<br/><br/>What I'm talking about is those situations where a player says, "OK, so when he runs under the hanging branch, I'll drop on him," and all the other players are nodding along. I remember that we're assuming player good will in Delve, so it could just easily be, "Oh, man! We forgot to lock the back door. We're all fucked!" ...and, likewise, all the other players are nodding along. In other words, the players' vision of the gameworld is consistent. But the GM was envisioning things a different way ("I thought they DID lock the door..."). Well, if it's not a hassle for the GM to adjust his or her vision a little bit (i.e. it doesn't violate some other aspect of the fiction), my stance is that the GM should do that. Because then the players are retaining that sense of the consistent world rather than experiencing broken goggles. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>I've just seen this a lot in-game, both as player and as GM. Everyone is really, definitely clear on something being a certain way. And then the GM steps in and is, like, "Uh-uh! Actually, there's no pictures hanging on the walls." And everybody kind has to blink and feel stupid and disconnected from the fiction. Seen it many, many times. You see this most often when players do narrate stuff into the fiction not because they're consciously authoring new information, but because the fiction has become so alive for them that they don't even realize they're adding new information. Stuff like:<br/><br/>"The bartender's eyes flash upwards, and he reaches behind the counter..."<br/>"Whoa! I grab the half-empty bottle in front of me and smash it into his face!"<br/><br/>If the GM is thinking, "actually, I was envisioning this as a more upscale kind of bar, with little shot glasses..."<br/><br/>Well, you've got to ask yourself, "Is it worth breaking the nice immersion we've got going on, or can I just downgrade the bar a little in my mind's vision and move on with it?"<br/><br/>That's been my experience of it, anyway, on both sides of the game pacing dial diagram.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258443/#Comment_258443" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T08:46:31+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  8:46AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 8:48AM by jenskot.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I've just seen this a lot in-game, both as player and as GM.

I need to \u201ccorrect\u201d players at first, \u201cthere are no bottles but only shot glasses.\u201d This makes it clear that we aren\u2019t just making things up on the fly (even if we are). <br/><br/>But at some point the players become so immersed they feel they are in the scene. Everything flows smoothly. I only have to say, \u201cyou\u2019re in the villain\u2019s office\u201d and they immediately \u201cknow\u201d what\u2019s there. At that point, if there level of immersion is so heightened and their visions aren\u2019t conflicting with each other, I shift from building suspension of disbelief into mining them for information on exactly what they are imagining. <br/><br/>It\u2019s tricky which is why I don't run these types of games very often. But with the right players it's fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258449/#Comment_258449" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T09:09:24+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  9:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah!

If the players do fuck up and start running with assumptions, of course the GM can downgrade the classiness of his bar a little -- unless the whole point of the bar is that it's classy.

The bottle could be nonexistent or out of reach.  Likewise, the bartender could be outside my character\u2019s range in such a way that picking up the bottle to strike him was pointless.  Dave, do you all find you have moments like this in play, when a player says that he or she wouldn\u2019t have done something in the first place once a later piece of information is revealed?<br/><br/>I don\u2019t like this style of play because it feels like asking permission the whole time, and I\u2019ve got a lot of baggage about this.  And I agree with John and Matt and Paul that a lot of people, precisely because they\u2019re immersed in what they\u2019re imagining, will state conclusive actions in the way you want to avoid.  When I say that my character picks up a bottle and hits the bartender in the head, I\u2019m looking for a Say Yes or Roll Dice moment.  But it doesn\u2019t seem like Delve is pushing for these moments of dice-based decision making, which makes me think I\u2019m simply interested in a different style of play.<br/><br/>*Or, it\u2019s not, courtesy of the pacing dial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258713/#Comment_258713" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T09:26:34+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  9:26AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I hear you. But it makes my "inefficiency warning" gauge ping in my head when I think about it. I'm not sure the rewards are worth the work, in other words. <br/><br/>Like, when you throw the applesauce, I want to be able to respond with something like, "You bastard! I'm wiping it off my nice, expensive shirt, and fuming."<br/><br/>Would I have to ask first, "Am I sitting close enough to you to get some on me?" ...later... "Where did it land? Is there any on my expensive shirt? Because, if so, I'd be pissed." "Yep, there's some on shirt." "Ok, then, I say: 'You bastard!' I'm wiping it off my nice, expensive shirt, and fuming."<br/><br/>I find the latter much less "immersive", as a player, because I can't just enjoy the fiction and roll with it and make decisions in-character. There's so much layering of "may I" and "is there?" between me making a decision in-character and finding out what happens as a result. That process rather snaps me out of the fictional world, because it causes me to think about you and me ("Would Dave think it was cool if there was apple sauce on me? What if he's actually imagining that I'm all the way across the room... but _I_ was imagining that we were really in each other's face during the whole last 30-minute conversation scene..."), and not about the game world reality.<br/><br/>I think I'll have play some more in this style while looking out for all those little cues, and get back to you. <br/><br/>And I hope you'll play some more in this style as a player, and get back to us!<br/><br/>Also, Daniel brings up (indirectly, perhaps) an interesting point: who, if at all, does any of this change as the pacing dial gets run from left to right?

Not at first since we start with few expectations and assumptions but as we delve deeper, assumptions naturally build as humans love to look for patterns and fill in blanks. <br/><br/>However, I think what I might lose in immersion, I gain in the joy of solving and exploring puzzles. It becomes less about being there and more about sorting through a box of puzzle pieces seeing how they fit together. Which I think is a big part of Delve. In some ways it might feel like Jared\u2019s Action Castle but larger in scale with less formal tools for interacting with the fiction. <br/><br/>Back to immersion, I agree that initiating an action based on assumptions only to find that they are wrong breaks immersion and suspension of disbelief. But I suspect in some cases it could also be a useful tool. In that moment someone might be caught off guard, even confused or annoyed but likely open for a split second to have their world views changed. It would be an excellent time to introduce a twist that explains why their assumptions are wrong. They can go from \u201cwhat?\u201d to \u201cwow\u201d in a mere moment with the right realignment.

Kind of a, "You can't assume <i>that</i>!  Roll the dice!" deal.  His idea was that a game's fiction-related mechanics ought to address those areas where abductive failure <i>mattered</i>, and just let the assumptions continue elsewhere.  So, like, if it's really important whether you assume correctly or incorrectly about lethal strikes, then you need a combat system... and if it's not important whether you assume correctly or incorrectly about sneaking then you don't need a stealth system.<br/><br/>In Delve, it's not the case that <i>every</i> fictional dynamic is important.  What's important is that the players are on the <i>same page</i> about the state of the setting.  Which, of course, is impossible if that state isn't <i>communicated</i>.<br/><br/>Paul,<br/>Your example where all the players are on the same immersed page and the GM's the one who's out of synch is something I almost never see.

I don't think anyone did.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I am aware (it's possible I could be wrong, though such things are rare) the term Rule Zero, as used at the Forge, is a pretty specific thing. It refers to any line in the rules text that says any variation on "If you don't like (this/a/some of the/all of the) rule(s), feel free to change/discard it. After all, it's your game." The vitriol heaped upon Rule Zero is rooted partially in the fact that the players don't need your permission; If they want to do this, they're going to do it whether or not you tell them too. The other major part of the hate-fest is rooted in the concept of System Matters. You as the designer presumably wrote the rules, tested the rules, tweaked the rules and tested them further. Whatever rules are in there are there for a reason, on purpose. Removal or alteration of any of the rules will have an effect on the way the game plays, which is assumed to be the way it is MEANT to be played.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it could be. You're striking off into unexplored territory when you start altering a game. Here There Be Dragons.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Forgive me if you already know of the following...) A related concept that exists in some form in the Forge-based toolkits is what is called Dials. I have a similar concept that I also use that I don't recall if it actually came from the Forge community that I call Switches. Essentially, these are <i>specific</i> alterations to the game that have been considered and presumably tested by the game designer. Dials are basically multiple setting changes (usually with differing levels of something). These can be changed in play (exactly like your pacing dial) or can be set for a session, an arc, or even an entire campaign. Switches are essentially on/off. They're rules that are added or removed, usually for longer than a single session. The important thing about these concepts that keep them from being an elaborate cover for Rule Zero is that their effect is considered and can be relied upon to a degree. Note that the dials and switches don't necessarily have to be named thus.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere this ties back in to where the discussion is currently going: What if the level of control that the players have over the details of the situation and setting is treated like a dial? Obviously the default setting should be where David is talking about. I think that there is something to be said for the other end of the spectrum, though... Considering more than a little something <i>has</i> been said for it, right here in this thread. Your way of playing it, David, may simply not work for John and Paul, even though the rest of the game system works amazingly for them. I'm sure that if they were to each playtest your game, they'd end up 'drifting' it to play that way anyway. I think it's better to acknowledge this possibility and account for it than to simply say that there is only one proper way to play Delve, and while doing any different may still be very fun, it's not the way it was intended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258861/#Comment_258861" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T18:57:22+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  6:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Lance.

Amen to "Fuck that."<br><br>So.  If I acknowledge that (a) the rule is there for a damn good reason, but (b) some players will hate it, and (c) that hatred may break the game for them worse than ignoring the rule would, then what's my best recourse?<br><br>One option is to turn the rule into a dial, and explicitly spell out how they can do something that I'd rather they didn't do, if they really have to.<br><br>The other option is to just state the rule, and let them fend for themselves if they choose not to follow it.<br/><br/>If I was looking through a rulebook and saw a rule that I didn't get, and was told, "Or you could set it this way instead," I don't think I'd try the default.  I think I'd try the dial-setting that instantly looked more appealing.  If the rulebook gave good guidance for that dial-setting, then the game would help me do what I wanted.  Sweet.<br/><br/>Let's call that Outcome B.<br/><br/>If the book doesn't communicate "reset this dial" we get different outcomes.  Outcome A: the players use the rules long enough to get the hang of using them in the way I intended.  Outcome C: the players abandon my rule (either from the get-go or after a brief trial) and come up with their own process that may not work so well.<br/><br/>So, for me, Outcome A is better than B is better than C.  <br/><br/>It seems like a coin flip as to what textual approach will serve me best: dial or hard and fast rule.<br/><br/>I think my preference is to put my energy into selling people on using my damn rule.

A gaming group with a good flow can make even a bad game fun, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd say D is close to, but not *quite* as good as, Outcome B, but it's notably less likely than Outcome B or even C.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not strongly in favor of a dial. I like them personally because I think there's middle ground between "You need to play my game this way, or should go find something better suited to your tastes" (which isn't nearly as defensive and standoffish as it sounds; It's a good thing to say!) and "If you don't like the rules, ignore them. It's your game." I think it's better to address that middle ground, inasmuch as you're willing to, within the text of the game. But this is a personal motivation, and you shouldn't feel pressured to do the same thing unless it feels right for you to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you encourage people to use your default ruling instead of turning the dial? Say "this is the way the game is meant to play. Most of the successful play has involved this way of doing it. Doing it this or this way has also been shown to work in some playtesting, but it changes the awesome in these specifically noted ways. In the end, you should choose whichever makes the game the most fun for you and your group, but you should really try it the way it's intended first, and see how that works for you." When I read things like that, I tend to be much more likely to try things the way they're intended, even if the alternative rules seem more my speed. This is more likely if we're trying the game out, as the alternate technique may produce different results from whatever I'd heard that's making me check the game out in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258962/#Comment_258962" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T14:19:11+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  2:19PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>"this is the way the game is meant to play.
