Leverage requiring a character to have the fictional positioning to be able to take action, propriety meaning the character's action must align with the genre, and scope being on what level a conflict may be overcome (one roll or multiple rolls).<br/><br/>I think these are codified terms of what is general practice in RPGs. But how (or do) they apply to particular games? I know leverage is used quite a bit in AW. Characters can only make Moves if they are triggered in the Fiction. The post-apoc genre lends propriety to the moves. I may be wrong, but I feel that scope isn't addressed in AW. Characters can seize another character's gun by force with a single move or they can seize a holding by force in a single move. (Again, I may be wrong on this last point.)<br/><br/>Anyhow, how do non-Solar System games make use of these concepts-turned-terms?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405704/#Comment_405704" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T20:44:49+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  8:44PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think these discussions were in TSoY. <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=114" rel="nofollow">Leverage</a> in this sense was something I coined on Fairgame, though I'm not sure if that was what Eero based his (excellent) discussion of it on. The others are great additions to the conversation. <br/><br/>I'd say scope in AW is a bit of a tricky issue. Arriving at the same sense of how much will be accomplished is not always easy. In Monsterhearts, my character wanted a show-down with (what I thought of as) the Big Bad. He showed up, and could have completely trounced me. We stood him off about something we cared about, and then he dismissed us. I was ready for a bit of drop-down drag out, but instead was written off, and as a player felt grateful for it since my character had bitten off way too much. My mis-alignment with the genre (mixing action with angsty horror) threw that final confrontation into different lights for the GM and I. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405708/#Comment_405708" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T01:52:55+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  1:52AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think scope in AW -- just like scope in Eeros's SS -- is always up for negotiation, with "the fiction" the main determining factor of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405710/#Comment_405710" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T02:53:20+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  2:53AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those terms were not in TSoY, although I consider the actual practice orthodox - that's how you play a classic Forge stakes-setting game like TSoY, I just put some words on the things that people need to be able to negotiate to make a stakes-prominent system (that is, one that doesn't set stakes implicitly, but rather requires you to explify why you're rolling the dice) work. I don't remember where I got "leverage", it was probably from Emily, but second-hand - somebody took the term to the Forge sometime in ~2005 or so and I latched onto it as significant, maybe. I remember applying the concept in theoretical overviews of what, exactly, is going on when players can or cannot engage the conflict resolution system to achieve their desires in games like TSoY or Dust Devils.<br/><br/>Any game that has free and universal conflict resolution (a game where players can declare near-arbitrary hook-ups between the fiction and the conflict procedure, I mean) requires the players to resolve these types of appropriateness thresholds when they start developing a new conflict. The exceptions and games that imply that they don't care about these things are rare and exceptional, and therefore very interesting. For example, it is often advocated that <i>Polaris</i> should be played in a dream-like manner, utilizing the conflict resolution system halfway between conflict resolution proper and scene resolution. In Polaris it's entirely possible to have a conflict's scope expand via the negotiation in ways that have nothing whatsoever to do with the PCs leverage: the conflict began as a fight with a demon, but at the end the players established next year's weather in Southpoint as well. We accept this feature as players because the game establishes a somewhat loose director stance for the players in relation to their characters: when you don't emphasize a tight player-character relationship, the need for having your resolution system focus strictly on <i>conflicts</i> disappears.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a game like <i>Heroquest</i> is an excellent example of a normal conflict resolution game that makes use of these norms of proper conflict, but the game text doesn't really say it because it's written in a pretty generic manner. This is not exceptional, I don't want to say that Heroquest has a problem - nearly all stakes-prominent game texts describe the conflict resolution procedure in an external manner: the text tells you that <i>when</i> you have a proper conflict opportunity, you <i>do this</i>; it never goes into the sticky theoretical issue of what makes the situation appropriate for the conflict resolution procedure. Thus in Heroquest the game text just tells the GM to utilize the system when it feels appropriate, relying on him to realize the appropriate conditions with experience and aesthetic sensibility. In reality it's pretty obvious that the GM needs to consider leverage, propriety and scope of the conflict before he allows the dice to hit the table, of course.<br/><br/>That discussion on the topic of appropriate stakes-setting in the SS booklet is just an overview, incidentally; I expect that there's more insight to be gained on it, I just didn't care to go into deeper theory in a rules text at the time.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is technically very similar to TSoY, so it's no wonder that as far as I can see, it handles leverage, propriety and scope exactly the same: you've got leverage if your character's been established as being in a position to attempt resolution in the scope you're suggesting; you've got propriety if your suggested course of action is psychologically and genre-wise credible, so that the other players don't find it disruptive; you've got scope if your suggested stakes match the fictional positioning (the tighter the positioning, the smaller the scope, generally speaking) and the crunch (Secrets in TSoY, Moves in AW, both imply ideal scope for conflicts in which they are utilized). The first two of these are handled this way in many games; the scope thing is a bit more special, but it happens to be the case that both TSoY and AW have that same negotiable way that crunch impacts fluff, combined with a propensity for discovering conflicts via positioning. It's a very familiar feel how both of these games roll along freely, establishing fictional positioning, until somebody discovers a conflict and declares it; the scope is instantly established on the basis of whether you declared the conflict early or late in the process of establishing the scene.<br/><br/>(That characterization of AW could be contested on the basis of the various heuristics it suggests for fictional positioning. "To do it, do it" and so on, those could be read as counter to the notion that scope might be variable. However, I don't think that's any different from the discussion of turning-points of conflict in the SS; both are just attempts at making players self-aware about concretizing their fictional positioning to establish leverage. Ultimately the choice of what is acceptable leverage and scope is necessarily a call that has to be made by the group when they utilize the conflict resolution system.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405970/#Comment_405970" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T17:27:18+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  5:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of RPGs tend to be very strict about scope and fictional leverage/move triggering, now that I think about it. They're all "<i>any time</i> the character uses this skill, roll <i>these</i> dice, and here's how many rounds it takes..." If anything, they may be more vague about fictional leverage, like "Roll to use a skill... unless it's not important. Then you don't have to." Which is probably a tough judgment call for new players. Most of the best-selling systems are pretty stringent when it comes to scope; the rulebook tells you exactly what a roll signifies ("one week of crafting") and it's not really a thing for the <i>table</i> or even the GM to decide.<br/><br/>Flexible stakes-setting is probably one of my favorite things in gaming; it lets a group laser-focus on what they find interesting and sort of gloss over stuff that isn't. I mean, if a group is super into the details of crafting magic items or whatever, rolling one skill check and announcing that a week has gone by is probably the worst thing in the world, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405971/#Comment_405971" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T17:28:11+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  5:28PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I am dying to meet this straw-man group of in-depth crafting RPGers that my brain somehow came up with.

(or here it might be that "if so and so situation is the case in AW, then so and so move CAN be used") and I'll still say that's still speaking fiction that plays on GM sympathy. They can't believe it, it's that obvious to them they can just get the peaches or whatever other act in the fiction.

As a comparison case, Jason has the same symptoms over whether the Forge exists.<br/><br/>I would love to claim that the cure to lone crusading is letting go of false notions, but the problem is that I'm something of a victim (or is it perpetrator?) myself, too: it seems that I can't participate in any discussion related to bigotry without positioning myself in a similar minority position that polarizes the discussion. So if I wanted to claim that your position differing from the consensus is proof of your position being wrong, then I would logically need to discard my own minority views as well.<br/><br/>However, a slightly more careful thesis might be justified: we lone crusaders should perhaps satisfy ourselves with developing a boilerplate argument for our case, and then just start linking to it in related discussion threads with a recommendation for others to not engage the position. This way we can satisfy our need to tell the truth without hijacking the entire discussion.

By nature, RPGs deal with creative fictional improvisation, which is something that cannot be quantified, codified, or categorized without a judgement call by somebody. Video games handle this through the use of a processor and hard-coded limitations. I suppose you could remove the judgement call by limiting what kind of fiction the players and GM can bring into the game?

As an analogy from politics/philosophy, there's a difference between the Rule of Law and Rule by Judges. Everybody (including the GM) needs to be playing the same game for the game to work. Everybody (including the GM) needs buy-in that a move is triggered. The game tells everyone to <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/12/26/interpretation-and-rules-interact-in-many-games-not-just-rpgs/" rel="nofollow">interpret</a> "the fiction" in order to decide when moves happen.
