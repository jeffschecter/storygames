If you want to sell your publications there, the deal is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creator(s) must own the rights to the publication.</li>\n<li>The creator(s) should be present to sell stuff. If you want to send someone to sell for you, please know beforehand that it doesn't work well; nothing sells like the passion of the creator. So please consider that.</li>\n<li>Learn (at least a little) about each of the games being sold so you can recommend them.</li>\n<li>Work at the booth for a little while. Until I know how many people there are going to be, I won't know how much we'll each have to work there, but we're already several people, so it won't be onorous.</li>\n<li>Take 100% of the cash from the sales of your own products. If your products are free, we should make sure you can still get the benefit from them and not have them wind up in the garbage can. (Unless, I suppose, that's part of the game).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://www.dexposure.com/d2011.html" rel="nofollow">Dreamation</a> is <strong>February 24-27</strong> in <strong>Morristown, NJ</strong>. It's easily accessible by New Jersey Transit, which stops at Penn Station.</p>\n<p>This thing is <strong>totally potluck</strong>. I'm organizing, but I'm only bringing the stuff I need and a little bit more. If you want to participate, let's figure out if there's something you can bring that will help make the tables better. Off the top of my head, we could use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Large, flat-colored cloths to cover tables and the area behind the tables.</li>\n<li>A large, easy-to-use calculator. If it prints, that would be awesome.</li>\n<li>An iPad that we can use as a register with my (or your) Square account to take credit cards.</li>\n<li>The ability to count money more reliably than I can</li>\n<li>Many book stands.</li>\n<li>Many games! </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vinnie, the con organizer, has given us the entire area, minus any exhibiting artists, to do with as we will. My guess is that we'll take up one to two tables of the space, but I know this crowd: we'll bring the awesome, even if we're squeezed into a single table.</p>\n<p>Please let me know in this thread if you're interested!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312012/#Comment_312012" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T07:48:37+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  7:48AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This would totally be my thing if they moved Dreamation to, say, Denmark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312015/#Comment_312015" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T08:07:04+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  8:07AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like how Luke, Aaron, and NerdNYC used to sell games at Dreamation 7-8 years ago, effectively as IPR before there was an IPR. Luke sold me my first indie game, Sorcerer right out of his backpack as he was walking back to the booth. <br/><br/>Which is another way of saying, awesome Joshua and good luck!

(And thanks to Jason for staying with us!)  If we can coordinate that sort of thing earlier for next time (Dexcon?) I'd really appreciate it- IPR isn't in the business of competing with our client publishers, and we're happy to support DIY efforts from anybody actually at the show. Unfortunately, my own Hero products didn't make it from California in time, so I wasn't able to partake in all the sales fun directly. dw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315402/#Comment_315402" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T20:07:51+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  8:07PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to thank you guys..

Who was ultimately responsible for verifying the counts at day's end?<br/>Were you guys set up to sell in the actual dealer room, which they didn't charge you anything for, or the gaming area? Did you get charged at all for vendor space? Was this deal made known to all the other vendors, or was it a last-minute/under-the-table thing?<br/>Were authors required to man the booth for a certain time in order to get their product represented? If not, were the people who did compensated in any way, or was the entire thing a wholly volunteer operation?<br/>Who ate the credit card charges? Were they distributed evenly, or billed to individual sales?<br/><br/>This sort of gray-market direct-selling is both really interesting and a smidgen unsettling to me for obvious reasons (if you cut any corners and the state tax inspectors make a round, as they sometimes do at larger Cons, you could be seriously fucked...), and I'm really curious about the logistics.<br/><br/>These are all questions I have dealt with for years, and am happy to consult on. I suspect that though this feels all cool and indie, you are taking some pretty significant risks with some low-probability but high-stakes potential liability.

We have separate business licenses and sales tax ID <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23s&amp;Mode=like">#s</a> for CT, MA, and NY, the three states we do Cons at. We have had state revenue folks come by our booth at every sizable Con we've attended to check our paperwork; not every show, very time, but enough that, besides the ethical considerations involved, I would never consider not doing everything properly for any of the shows we vend at.<br/><br/>My hunch is that because you're pooling your resources and selling under one banner, that what you're operating is a mercantile retail establishment as defined by NJ state law. Your individual grosses don't matter when you're all selling under one roof and using a shared cash pool like that. I totally get the desire to be all indie spirit and everything, but my gut reaction reading this is to feel the way you would if I told YOU I was doing art design on someone's RPG. : )<br/><br/>DIY is one thing when you're selling individual copies of your games by mail order, where the customers are responsible for remitting use tax to the destination state, but you guys are <i>running a store</i>, and could get not just yourselves, but the Con in serious trouble, and as happy as all this informal agreement stuff is, there is MONEY involved, which means there are liability and legal questions involved that can't be hand-waved with "it's OK, we're all pals". Tax collectors don't fuck around in Jersey.<br/><br/>Your best bet is to have one of your publishers who's already a registered NJ business with a tax ID number be the vendor of record who received the revenue for the sales and remits the tax to the state. They'd sell your books on a 100% consignment basis, maybe less a small holdback for cc fees and processing (call it 5%). If you wanted to, you could all agree to include sales tax in the purchase price and just eat it for the customer, with the vendor holding back maybe 10%, but there's no real reason to do that other than to feel warm and fuzzy: sales tax on retail sales is well-established law, and none of your customers should have any trouble paying it.<br/><br/>The other option is to work out a deal with another vendor, maybe even IPR, to stock all that stuff in his booth at the show and sell it on a 100% consignment basis for a modest fee. Or get a few people with some retail experience to make organizing and manning the bazaar part of their work at the show. Perhaps a non-profit that returns all proceeds above operating costs to the authors? Might be doable. Maybe partner with local retailers to use their name and staff to do the actual selling in exchange for product but no cash? It may be that NJ offers one-time 'festival' tax IDs, I know other states do similar stuff.<br/><br/>The guys who mumble at you may be ignorant, or just reluctant to talk about their businesses, or crooks. Regardless, they're legally required to be collecting and remitting sales tax to NJ for sales made at the show.<br/><br/>One of the things that I think goes under-appreciated about retailers is that the <i>good</i> ones, the competent, responsible ones, do more than just expose your product to more people than you might be able to yourself. By putting your book into the channel or into the hands of someone who's spent as many years teaching themselves to handle inventory and perform sales as you have in learning to design rules and lay out graphics and text, they take on all the RISK associated with the business part of selling. They assume the sales tax burden, handle consumer protection matters, deal with credit card security (another thing I winced at when I read how you were handling it), assume all risk for shrinkage, and generally let you guys write and draw so that you don't have to do all that stuff that's actually harder than it looks (which is why so many game stores suck: it's harder than it looks).<br/><br/>I say all this with the understanding that for many/most of you, selling your stuff is ancillary to your real mission of design or play, and that the profit motive is not necessarily the driving force here. I'm totally cool with that, and rather like it, it's a nice change of pace from worrying about it all the time at my day job. But there's also some unforeseen ways to get yourself in real-world trouble if you let your boundaries get too permeable between the fun and the business, and I'm hoping to be as helpful as I can to the community in making sure that doesn't happen.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315666/#Comment_315666" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-06T17:14:25+00:00" title="March  6, 2011  5:14PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For reference, and possibly helpful in resolving some of these questions:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/ocp/" rel="nofollow">New Jersey Office of Consumer Protection</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/su.shtml" rel="nofollow">The Sales and Use Tax guide for the NJ Dept of Revenue.</a><br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315669/#Comment_315669" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-06T17:33:33+00:00" title="March  6, 2011  5:33PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2011 6:53PM by Todd_L.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alternately, next year you just bring one sample copy of each book <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and an iPad, so buyers can order online and NJ can go fuck itself.</span><br/><br/><br/>*on second thought, the iPad is optional.
