Just as inevitably, I started pontificating on the genre of detective fiction.<br/><br/>At one point, Seth asked me how well I thought Dirty Secrets would do stories in the vein of James Ellroy's Los Angeles quartet of novels (Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz). That, in turn, led to a discussion of how the investigators played a different role in Ellroy's books than they do in the "classic" hardboiled novels of Chandler and Ross MacDonald, which obviously were a big influence on Ellroy.<br/><br/>At the end of that discussion, Seth asked me if I would write up my thoughts as a piece for Dirty Secrets fans. This is my effort at writing such an essay.\n<blockquote>"You smell like trouble to me," he said.<br/><br/>That stopped me for a minute. He had a salesman's insight into human weakness, and he'd touched on a fact which I didn't always admit to myself\u2009-\u2009that I sometimes served as a catalyst for trouble, not unwillingly.<br/><br/><cite>-Ross MacDonald, <em>The Underground Man</em></cite></blockquote>\nLew Archer\u2009-\u2009the most famous of Ross MacDonald's characters\u2009-\u2009and Phillip Marlowe\u2009-\u2009the iconic investigator created by Raymond Chandler\u2009-\u2009are cut from the same cloth. Both are stoic, rather cynical men. Both work as private investigators because they are good at it and because the shamus biz (barely) pays the bills. Both are keen-eyed observers of humanity; in fact, that is almost all that they are.<br/><br/>Rather than fully fleshed-out characters\u2009-\u2009what you would expect from a novel's protagonist\u2009-\u2009Archer and Marlowe serve as macguffins. They provoke other characters into explaining themselves\u2009-\u2009their interests, their weaknesses, their loves and their crimes. Once they are hired, the detectives make a few enquiries, probe at the contradictions, and learn what lies people are telling about themselves and each other. Eventually, the truth of the matter comes out of the other characters' mouths. They don't even take responsibility if a few people are killed along the way. Archer and Chandler are forces of nature.<br/><br/>Yes, we do know a few things about them. Archer, for example, is a divorced ex-cop that served in the Army during World War II. Eventually, in The Blue Hammer, Archer finally becomes involved in a proper relationship with. Marlowe loves to replay grandmaster games of chess in his spare time. Any character you can sum up in a sentence or two is not a typical protagonist, though.<br/><br/>To call these investigators one-dimensional would impugn the depth of straight lines everywhere.<br/><br/>The one human relationship we see Marlowe in\u2009-\u2009his friendship with Terry Lennox in The Long Goodbye\u2009-\u2009is just as much a macguffin as the detectives themselves. One chapter shows the random meeting in a bar that established the friendship <em>and</em> fateful request that Marlowe drive him to meet a flight to Tijuana. Next we know, Lennox is dead and accused of killing his wife. Marlowe's time in lockup gets a more involved treatment, and Lennox's murder, while ultimately tied in to the rest of the novel's events, takes a back seat to the events surrounding Roger and Eileen Wade for a large chunk of the book.<br/><br/>MacDonald's The Underground Man features a similar hastily cobbled together macguffin relationship. In this case, Archer meets a young child whose parents are openly hostile to each other in a park while feeding birds. A few days later, he is kidnapped by his father, and the boy's mother turns to Archer for help. Again it is notable mostly because it is a distinction that fails to make a difference to MacDonald's style.<br/><br/>There is one significant exception to this pattern, though. In The Doomsters, Lew Archer finds himself confronted with a case that dredges up unhappy memories of his own past. This is a classic example of an exception that proves the rule, though. Outside of one romantic entanglement, subsequent Archer novels do not delve much deeper into his character.<br/><br/>(CONT)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139762/#Comment_139762" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T10:44:01+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 10:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2008 10:45AM by Linnaeus.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Never get personally involved. It was <em>the</em> golden rule. And practically every case he worked, Rebus broke it. He sometimes felt that the reason he became so involved in his cases was that he had no life of his own. He could only live <em>through</em> other people.<cite>-Ian Rankin, <em>The Hanging Garden</em></cite></blockquote>\nThe investigators of Ellroy's novels, compared to the classic detectives, are well-realized characters. They are monomaniacally driven to investigate the crimes at hand, but they do so for reasons of character\u2009-\u2009even for love. Edmund Exley is out to prove that he deserves to be a high-flyer, and to prove that a straight cop can be an effective cop. Jack Vincennes busts actors on drug charges at the behest of a tabloid paper for the sake of becoming famous, leveraging that fame into a career as a movie consultant.<br/><br/>Bud White's motivation is even more personal. His partner and best friend Dick Stensland is a victim of the central crime. Later, he also falls for a Veronica Lake-lookalike prostitute that works for a prime suspect. And that's just the investigators in L.A. Confidential.<br/><br/>It helps that the '40s Hollywood Ellroy portrays in his books is more lurid than the allergic-to-scandal upper class enclaves that MacDonald and Chandler look at. Still, even in summary, Ellroy's detectives jump out at you. They have real relationships that affect their lives, they become obsessed with their cases for personal\u2009-\u2009rather than philosophical\u2009-\u2009reasons. They even have blood on their hands.<br/><br/>In Bladerunner, Deckard begins every bit as disaffected as Lew Archer. He doesn't even want to take the case\u2009-\u2009tracking down murderous artificial humanoids known as replicants\u2009-\u2009but he is forced into it by his boss. As he investigates, Deckard learns things about himself that he may prefer not to know, and develops an ability to empathize with the seemingly inhuman replicants. He falls in love with a female replicant who is not involved in the killings. When, at the end of the film, the replicant leader dies at Deckard's feet with a lament about the loss that his own death entails, Deckard is forced to contemplate his own humanity and the value of his own existence.<br/><br/>Chief Inspector John Rebus, the Edinburgh investigator in most of Ian Rankin's stories, displays a different reason for being drawn into his cases. Investigating crimes dulls the pain of his own failure as a husband, father, and all-around human being. He latches onto the idea of helping victims, but really police work is his drug of choice, a method of running from personal pain.<br/><br/>When playing Dirty Secrets, I think these growing personal ties happen more organically when they are developed during play. If you try to create this kind of story from the start it will tend to fight several aspects of the rules. Seth disagrees with me about this, though, so your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>(CONT)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139763/#Comment_139763" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T10:45:25+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 10:45AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Richard Kimble: I didn't kill my wife.<br/>Lt. Phillip Gerard: Jury said different.<br/><br/><cite>-<em>The Fugitive</em> (2000)</cite></blockquote>\nMy suggestion, if you want to force a personal tie between the investigator and the crime, is to establish it at the start of your story, like Bud White's murdered partner. You need an investigator that is unable to let go of a case because the crime affected them directly. The victim is a close friend or a family member, the investigator is a suspect, or some other consequence of the crime demands that the investigator get solve the puzzle laid at their feet.<br/><br/>When they appear in other media this type of story lies outside the hardboiled genre that Dirty Secrets is most closely tied to. That does not mean that players must shun it, though. If they feel a connection to the investigator right off the bat, it can make the game even more powerful. It can also work well with the Corrupt Investigator variant at the end of the rules section of the Dirty Secrets book.<br/><br/>The canonical reference for this type of investigation is The Fugitive\u2009-\u2009both the television series (which I have not seen) and the film adaptation (which I have)\u2009-\u2009even though neither comes close to being hardboiled. Richard Kimble is accused of murdering his wife, and the only way he can prove his innocence is by finding "The One-Armed Man" who actually committed the crime and proving his guilt. In this case, Kimble gets it with both barrels, as he is accused of a crime he did not commit against the woman he loved more than any other.<br/><br/>Choosing how emotionally invested your investigator is will shape your story. The detached Marlowe-type will observe at arm's length, making the game philosophical and about the other characters. A Kimble-like investigator, who is as much a victim of the initial crime as anyone, will tend toward a personal story about the investigator as a character. The investigator will be emotionally revealed during the story. An initially detached investigator who is drawn into the lives of the other characters may be even more richly drawn still, but this is also the hardest kind of story to plan out in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139766/#Comment_139766" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T11:12:25+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 11:12AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AWESOME topic!<br/><br/>Let me say, that I used to agree with your evaluation of Lew Archer and Philip Marlowe until I had some rather hard fought conversations with Ron Edwards on the genre.

I have to admit that I overlooked this point because the first-person voice makes the character "transparent," as if he were just a mouthpiece for the authour.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I would say that these investigators normally stay at arm's length from their cases. Maybe it would be better to say that they investigate because of their abstract ideals (and their pay), not a personal attachment to the case.\n<blockquote>The one thing the few I read had in common is that the murder was a woman but Lew Archer clearly placed moral responsibility for the crime with the man in her life because of his failure to properly care for her.

It's probably closer to three novels, but there is still a lot of truth in it.<br/><br/>It's been years\u2009\u2013\u2009well over a decade\u2009\u2013\u2009since I read the LA quartet, so I can't coherently comment on the themes in them. The part that stands out most to me is the detectives in LZ Confidential, and Bucky Bleichert's obsession with the Black Dahlia.\n<blockquote>To me the difference between Ellroy and MacDonald &amp; Chandler isn't really the personal depth of the character.

I think the other thing that's overlooked in differentiating between the two sorts of investigators is that Ellroy's investigators are not portrayed as reliably moral actors, indeed, they are generally portrayed as highly blameworthy, often blinkered, and certainly with an agenda of their own other than merely exposing the crimes of others.  The first- versus third-person narration contributes mightily to this.<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets-wise, I think it could be fairly easy to make the investigator involved in the case to some degree, at least as much as any other character, just by having the option to write the investigator on the crime grid, be a target of relationships, and including such in the narration. What Dirty Secrets doesn't generate is the kind of vicelike inevitability of the Ellroy novel (or "The Wire", another politically aware mystery series with multiple layers of motivation and involvement).  In Ellroy, as the corruption and obsession close tighter and tighter around victim, family, perpetrator, and investigators, choices are cut off and everything is heightened.  In Dirty Secrets, because crime resolution is resolutely (ha ha) random, there is no way to push inevitability as a narrative force.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139825/#Comment_139825" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T13:48:54+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  1:48PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Great topic. I think the other thing that's overlooked in differentiating between the two sorts of investigators is that Ellroy's investigators are not portrayed as reliably moral actors, indeed, they are generally portrayed as highly blameworthy, often blinkered, and certainly with an agenda of their own other than merely exposing the crimes of others</blockquote>\nI just agreed with JDCorley... the world must be ending. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>May I suggest a rules hack to promote this:  I suggest adding a new scene type called Agenda.  An investigator can propose an Agenda scene and authorities are allowed to block with Agenda scenes under all the normal circumstances they would be allowed to block with.  I suggest that Agenda scenes work just like Investigation scenes with two exceptions.<br/><br/>1) Whoever calls for a Conflict gets to decide whether the Violence dice are used or not.  If they aren't use the conflict can not produce Violence.<br/><br/>2) The Witness does not move at the end of the scene, although its position still determine the number of times a conflict can be pushed.<br/><br/>Basically an Agenda scene is a great way to try to steal dice from the players without progressing the mystery part of the plot.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139845/#Comment_139845" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T15:19:57+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  3:19PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh. That's interesting. So, whose Agenda is pursued in the scene? The investigator's? Someone else's?<br/><br/>Let me add this:  last year at Forge Midwest, when Paul Czege playtested the game, he suggested having two investigators, competing against each other in some way. Obviously, I didn't go with this option for the game as written, because it didn't fit the genre as I was wanting to depict it.  But since we're trying to do Ellroy or <i>The Wire</i>, this might be an interesting addition. Maybe you rotate investigators <i>and</i> Authorities. And, in this case, maybe an Agenda sequence allows the two investigators to interfere with each other.<br/><br/>Hmm.  Add in the corrupt investigator option (where the investigator can go on the Grid) for additional craziness....<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139848/#Comment_139848" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T15:29:29+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  3:29PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth<br/><br/>It could be either although I imagine that whoever calls of the scene decides.  If the Investigator calls for it then clearly he's trying to get something out of a fellow cop or a relative or something.

The mechanics are squarely focused at exposing and deepening the characters and details surrounding the crimes.  There is no support for adding that political layer of obfuscation.  I think the players CAN add it if they want to.  In fact, I would argue that when we did our Grey Ranks/Dirty Secrets cross over we added that layer.
