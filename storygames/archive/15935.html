I'm a long time rpg.net poster and saw a reference that made me want to check out this forum - it seems to align to the sort of gaming that I want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently came off of a very successful Exalted game (via Qwixalted) that reached some utterly sublime moments. Fitting of these forums, those moments were very intense moments of collaborative story telling. I'm looking to recreate those feeling, both in my players and within myself as the ST. My current inspiration to recreate these feelings is to hack the key components of Wraith into something that I find playable. Namely passion, regret, and a very bleak world. Possibly something that mechanically simulated the struggle against the Shadow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any games worth checking out that might have dodged my radar? I see some value in Don't Rest Your Head, but the game looks a bit tough to easily grasp. I saw all the talk about Apocalypse World, but it feels a bit too one shot and class based to achieve what I'm looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people want to brainstorm and throw some things against the wall, that would be awesome. However, I'd be totally satisfied with some direction from the folks that seem to have a tighter grasp on this style of gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362566/#Comment_362566" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T05:12:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  5:12AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you ever seen the vampire quick start game.

It adds great detail and makes an awesome action game, but I feel like it lacks those Narrative levers that I think Wraith really needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nJ Watson - It seems that I'll need to take a further look =) I tossed it out as a no-go mainly because it seems to be really popular to hack, but it didn't seem to have the right sort of thematics built into it to support what I'm looking for. Now I may very well be wrong, so enlighten away!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd really like something that simulates a group version of What Dreams May Come. I can ditch specific powers and all that jazz as I think Attributes along the lines of those in Hollow Point can pick up that slack (no need to linger on lists and all that). <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that made sense - any other feedback or suggestions would be killer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362865/#Comment_362865" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T05:59:19+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  5:59AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mat, this may not be (and probably isn't) what you're looking for, but if you want to go simple, simple, simple with your <i>Wraith</i>-style play, you could do worse than checking out Kaare Berg's <a href="http://nordickanji.typepad.com/files/shadows-and-ash.pdf" rel="nofollow">Shadows and Ash</a>.

Two off the top of my head, not "new and hot", but still might satisfy your exact request:<br/><br/><b>The Collectors: The Burning House</b>. This game uses the Fudge system (not FATE, just original Fudge), and features the PCs all as soul collectors working for the Devil. Very bleak, lots of regret, pretty dark but also a little hopeful. No mechanical rules for the struggle against anything, but it's really anchored in the setting (although you don't have a Wraith "Shadow" analogue):<br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=16518" rel="nofollow">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=16518</a><br/><br/><b>VOX:</b> Mike F created this basically to recreate the feel of Wraith. Every character has one (or eventually more) "Shadow" characters, each controlled by another player. Eventually, the character either has to synthesize or totally reject the Shadow aspect. Now mind, unlike Wraith the Shadow does not have to be (but can be) a polar opposite of the PC: It could be anything from "the word of God... maybe?" to "Odin!" to "an insect creature that whispers to me" to "a different, darker version of myself". Very surreal setting, it's basically half Wraith, half Twin Peaks with possibly a little Silent Hill 2 thrown in.<br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=63301" rel="nofollow">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=63301</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nunboi" title="nunboi"><img alt="nunboi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nunboi">nunboi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363496/#Comment_363496" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T14:13:09+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  2:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've got to say, big thanks for all the replies. Browsing through all of the suggestions has been a blast - some, such as Ghost/Echo nearly scratched the itch, but might be a bit too loose for me to sink my teeth into. After reading the links for Steerpike, <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I should give AW another look, despite my issues with classes (which wouldn't be related to a social splat like Guild), I can see some things that jibe with my thoughts on play. I'll probably also look at some of the resolution systems and work on something totally new - some sort of collaborate Sartre-Hell based around Platonic or Kabalistic soul structures.
