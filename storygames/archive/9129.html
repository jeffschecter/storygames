Complete information games can have fortune/randomness. Ideally, every rpg without hidden information is a game of complete information - every player is absolutely aware of all other players' objective functions. In practice this is not true at all, 'cause one day I might put high value on fictionally stabbing a fictional dragon and the next just want to cuddle with it, and sometimes it's hard to tell in advance which of these I value.<br/><br/>To be clear: fortune/randomness is compatible with complete information, since all players can know "now he rolls a d10". Hidden information like your Dark Fate is not compatible with complete information, because all but one player can know "he has a random Dark Fate" but that specific Dark Fate holder also knows exactly which it is. Plenty of games theoretically have complete information... it takes an extremely self-knowledgeable, cohesive group to practically have complete information.<br/><br/>My guess is you're asking a more specific question than "how does complete information affect player actions, the story, characters, etc." though. Or my hope, rather, 'cause I'm not sure I could actually apply whatever the answer to the broad question happens to be to anything!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201834/#Comment_201834" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T13:52:03+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  1:52PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2009 2:00PM by sage.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm thinking just from a mechanical point of view, when resolving a conflict (or whatever triggers going to the rules in your game of choice) you have all the information.<br/><br/>So, examples might help:<br/><br/>Not Complete Information: My 4E party walks into a 30 by 30 room and is confronted by a monster that the DM informs us is called an orc. As a player, I don't know:\n<ul>\n<li>The orc's goals</li>\n<li>The orc's available strategies</li>\n<li>(Depending on the type of game and/or my experience) The orc's stats</li>\n</ul>\nJust to name a few.<br/><br/>Complete Information: We're playing Some Made Up Game. To resolve a debate in Congress, we play a game of chess, with the initial board position following from the circumstances in some manner based on the rules. As the conflict starts, I know:\n<ul>\n<li>The other side's goal (chess is won by checkmate)</li>\n<li>The other side's available strategies (both of our pieces follow the exact same rules, which are known to me)</li>\n<li>The other side's abilities (a piece can always capture another piece who's square it enters, and so on)</li>\n</ul>\nSo I'm pondering the idea of a game where, mechanically at least, both sides have all the information. In your opinion (based on actual play or just looking at the idea), does this make much of a difference in how the game plays, or is it just some (mathematical) game theory junk?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201836/#Comment_201836" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T13:58:04+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  1:58PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GreedyAlgorithm</cite><br/>My guess is you're asking a more specific question than "how does complete information affect player actions, the story, characters, etc." though.

You say that your character starts yelling at me, so I say my character runs behind a tree and starts crying. Mechanically, that's meaningless, but maybe you didn't realize there was a tree close enough by for me to do that. Sure, it's just color, but color can have a big effect on the mood of the game. Mechanically, nothing's changed, but your character is going to look like a jerk if they keep yelling at me while I'm hiding behind a tree.<br/><br/>That kind of stuff can have a big effect on your future choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201853/#Comment_201853" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T15:26:45+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  3:26PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple things I think I learned...<br/><br/>RPGs (including LARPs, etc.) which do push for some sort of "competition" in the vein of most non-RPG games (which are nowadays still the majority of RPGs, I believe) almost invariably rely on "secrets" and incomplete information (asimmetric information, actually) to provide a challenge.<br/>One possible reason for that is that designing an interesting challenge in a complete information environment is <i>harder</i>, and pulling it off requires skill. Not impossible, you know, just harder (last time I checked, <i>Beast Hunters </i>was an excellently gamist, challenge-based RPG which used complete information). I'd say that, being harder to pull off, it's also more fulfilling for all involved.<br/><br/>RPGs where the goal is aesthetic, though, including "story now" oriented designs, most often work <i>better </i>with complete information. Complete information makes it <i>easier </i>for everyone involved to make aesthetic-grounded choices with insurance that those choices are to retain <i>meaning </i>in the grand picture.<br/>When obscured information is involved (example: transgressions in Spione), then the act of <b>revealing </b>such information (thus progressing the game to a complete information status!) is strongly emphasized as either a goal or a crucial stage of play: in a sense, employing obscured information in aesthetic-oriented roleplay is an advanced technique meant to improve the sense of meaningfulness emanating from the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201856/#Comment_201856" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T15:39:07+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  3:39PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafu</cite>I'd say that, being harder to pull off, it's also more fulfilling for all involved.</blockquote>\nWere you making a causal claim there?

One almost WANTS to spill it, to someone, "accidentally," so they can see the awesomeness. Otherwise, it's a form of masturbation (which, you know, is still pleasant and all) unless it can inform the GM of how to work you into some plots you'd otherwise not have stumbled into (e.g. your secret alliance with The Men In Black, in MET, gets you a pre-warning about an impending raid).<br/><br/>Maybe it's worth bifurcating this thread into "mechanical" secrets (e.g. you don't know how many resources I have at a given moment, in, say, Universalis) versus "fictional" secrets (e.g. you don't know about my character's Instincts in BW, until I ping them--and even not then, if the GM is sneaky about rewarding me Artha for pinging them). The former has a very different impact on play (e.g. more about bluff and strategy) than the latter (e.g. more about acting and choices in the fiction).<br/><br/>Maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201953/#Comment_201953" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T09:23:50+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  9:23AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sort of secrets I meant, by the way, were things like "You don't know what's around the next corner" or "You don't know what's in the safe".

(If it's a boring secret that no one would have ever wanted to do anything with, I suppose it can stay secret and you won't be missing out on anything...but why waste your time on boring secrets?)  <br/><br/>And generally, I have to agree that when you're looking at the subset of "character secrets," sharing them with your fellow players at the outset is the way to go, especially if keeping that secret is a big deal for the character or the secret has to do with a central part of the character's concept.  Having other people push, trample on, and shine a spotlight on things relating to your character's secret makes that secret more valuable in play: it drives action, it explains motivation, it lets other people appreciate your character and equips them to better participate in scenes with your character.  The real joy of having characters with secrets is not successfully putting one over on everyone else at the table, but <i>doing something</i> with those secrets, and it's easier to do something if you can get a little collaboration from the rest of the group.  Considering that everyone's sitting down so that they can collaborate, it seems only natural to spill the beans out of character so that everyone can enjoy finding out (or failing to find out) the secret in-character.<br/><br/><br/>But that, as Graham points out, is a very different beast from the "what's in the safe?" style of secret.  I'm cool with the latter, in general...although I have to admit I do want SOMEONE to know what's in the safe when it appears, because it always seems unsatisfactory to me if it's obvious that the contents are only getting invented once the safe is opened.

In something like DnD it's possibly not hard to know what other players' payoffs are, since they are all about killing monsters and not dying.  But even here it's probably influenced by the difficulty.  Some players just want to win and be heroes, some want to overcome very difficult tactical problems, and some are in between (I'm over simplifying to make my point).  Where does a player lie on that spectrum?  You need to nail it down to know his payoffs (note payoffs are going to be for players, not characters).<br/><br/>Games like Burning Wheel that have Beliefs help us to know what the payoffs are, because we write down our desires for the game.  This is assuming all the players know all the beliefs, including those of all the NPCs.  But the GM is working on a scale larger than this.  His job transcends any single character.  And even if you have something like Beliefs, you only have 3 or so.  Is that player's payoffs defined just by that?  Surely what he wants out of the game is more complicated.  <br/><br/>Talking about what everyone wants I think is vital to a good game, because if you don't know the other players' payoffs (at least in a general sense, you don't need to know what the GM has planned specifically) then you end up playing different games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202011/#Comment_202011" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T13:47:40+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  1:47PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps even within the category of story secrets (as opposed to mechanical secrets, not where I had started but very interesting) there's a distinction between long term and short term secrets? I've found it extremely enjoyable to have a secret for, say, a session with a big reveal at the end. I have some plan that I'm going to pitch to the people of the town, but I don't want to tell everyone about it before I get to present it, or somesuch. It's very satisfying for me as a player or as a GM to have a little mystery that gets resolved promptly. Nothing central to the character, but important nonetheless.

Nobody knew that she was female, and I enjoyed the mild puzzlement that other PCs expressed due to "Victor" behaving slightly oddly at times. For example, Victor was considered slightly paranoid for sleeping in his clothes, as though worried that "he" would be attacked in the middle of the night. The enjoyment of this character was not lording it over other players with an "I've got a secret!" attitude - most players didn't actually suspect that Victoria had secrets. Rather, my enjoyment came from finding out what it was like to protect your secrets without other people suspecting anything was up, finding out what I'd have to do.
