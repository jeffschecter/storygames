Sorry, can't help, but perhaps I can give direction? (I'm interested in this, too):<br/><br/>I thought of an avenue that may help, though it's kinda sketchy. Some of the best GMs that I learned under were great at:<br/>* Making you feel like your choices mattered.<br/>* Were great at explaining the rules/setting.<br/>* Were particularly good about making you feel awesome, or that the things that you put forth were awesome.<br/>* Were really organized.<br/>...a lot of this stuff is common with public spakers, motivational speakers and the like.<br/><br/>So maybe if there's books/youtube talks out there on how to do public speaking, perhaps especially focused on motivational speaking, that might have some pointers.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350582/#Comment_350582" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T12:55:56+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 12:55PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, your list is super helpful!  Point three resonates with what I was going to share:<br/><br/>Michael Rabiger's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Directing-Third-Techniques-Aesthetics-Screencraft/dp/0240805178" rel="nofollow">Directing</a>, has an interesting section on working with actors.  (It's probably too short to make buying the book worthwhile for this alone, however.)  I've skimmed this and what stood out for me is the commentary on the role of the director being to remove emotional blocks for the actors, who are in quite a vulnerable position (raw displays of emotion which are being silently judged by numerous others, for example).<br/><br/>Another resource I've really enjoyed is the <a href="http://greenlightwiki.com/improv/" rel="nofollow">Greenlight Improv Wiki</a>, especially its bit on various 'unfunny' habits (joke-telling, defending, pre-planning) are all ways that we try to hide ourselves from others.<br/><br/>I confess the idea of showmanship raises a red flag for me, mostly because it seems (at first blush) to run counter to my own goals of transparency and creative freedom.  (I mean, putting on an entertaining act means the others aren't seing me, and it runs the risk of sending the message that's what I want them to do also.)

There's those "Toastmasters" groups that work on people who have problems with public speaking (or whom simply hope to get better)... I wonder if there are Toastmasters books and the like, or do they all just give presos and speeches and demos over and over until they gain confidence? Something to investigate, I'd wager.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toastmasters.org/</a><br/><br/>In fact... hell... maybe we were all looking for Toastmasters all along ...?<br/>(I need to look into this further!)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350594/#Comment_350594" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T14:34:32+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  2:34PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2011 2:36PM by jenskot.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had mixed results with toastmasters but I suspect your experience will vary greatly from club to club.
