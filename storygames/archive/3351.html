And so I'm not sure what it is, really. It's not an RPG, but it's a game in which you play roles...<br/><br/>I guess I'm asking if anyone knows of games along those lines. Maybe I just need to write the darn thing up so you can see it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75751/#Comment_75751" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T15:40:39+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  3:40PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently working on a campaign (currently unconnected to a game/system, although Scion, Changeling, and GURPS In Nomine are all possibilities) in which the "main" characters only have the very barest of interactions, and the players take on different minor roles in different portions of the "big story" that includes everyone. It's highly outre' and could definitely use some grounding by people talking about "ranges" on the scale from "everyone together all the time" to "totally independent stories" and how they moved in one direction or another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DagobahDave" title="DagobahDave"><img alt="DagobahDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DagobahDave">DagobahDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75754/#Comment_75754" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T16:14:33+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  4:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn, you might want to check out my game idea, which I posted here:<br/>\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3340&amp;page=1#Item_3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3340&amp;page;=1#Item_3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a collaborative, competitive story-building game that, just based on your list of wants, does almost everything you describe. You probably have something else in mind for your game, but I think you could find a way to include a 'question and answer' sort of mechanic in place of my 'advance the story' rules. Might be worth a look. It's worth a shameless plug, anyway. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
