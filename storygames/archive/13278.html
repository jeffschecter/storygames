We played two sessions over two nights.<br/><br/>I still endeavor to introduce <a href="http://www.mythic-cartography.org/what-does-storyjamming-mean/" rel="nofollow">storyjamming</a> to players who have never done it before. I believe collaborative storytelling can really enrich anyone's life, and make more personally relevant stories than Hollywood or other media. I had at least five players who had never played a "story game" before, for a total of 8 players (!!).<br/><br/>I always have an experiment going for every game I run. Most importantly, I want every step of game play to feel like fun, including "learning the rules". To maximize fun and most quickly learn the fundaments of game play, I have an array of tools I use.<br/><br/>In the past, I had a series of <a href="http://www.mythic-cartography.org/2009/02/25/the-pedagogy-of-play-bite-sized-pieces-part-ii/" rel="nofollow">warm-up games</a> I consistently used, specifically (in this order) "Firing Line", "One Word at a Time", "Color, Advance", and "I see you". These games have a downside in that they don't necessarily relate directly to the setting or story, unless you have a creative way to make them relevant. I've gotten positive feedback from players, but still I want every moment of play to contribute to the shared story.<br/><br/>I love Archipelago because the ritual phrases offer an alternative way to ease into a game and gain confidence setting scenes (such as "Try a different way", "More details", "That won't be so easy").<br/><br/>I realized that most importantly to me, I want new players to feel confident and comfortable creating fiction; in the back of Archipelago Matthijs lists several principles of good Archipelago play (such as "Yes, and..." and "Accept input"). <br/><br/>I made five major decisions to accelerate play, group cohesion, confidence in contributing in the shared fiction, and learning the "rules" of Archipelago.<br/><br/>First, I gave all the ritual phrases hand signs (taken from ASL), that made it easier and gentler to interrupt another player's flow to get "more details" or "try things differently", and modeled memorably using the ritual phrases.<br/><br/>Second, I created two other ritual phrase, "Help", to support the "Ask for input" principle. New players don't know how to quickly get rescued from a creative block, and tend to freeze up and stress out. "Help" worked amazingly; everyone had an easy out, all they had to do was make the ASL hand sign  for "Help" and other players jumped in to rescue the moment. Also, I used the ASL hand-sign "Finish" to indicate the end of scene.<br/><br/>Third, I ran "I see you" for everyone's character. All the players remarked on how vivid their shared vision of each other became. They really enjoyed this part. Formerly stereotyped, cardboard characters became rich and mysterious, everyone wondering how they would fare in the story. Already interesting characters acquired even more depth.<br/><br/>Fourth, instead of a destiny "statement", we all created destiny "loaded questions" to answer, and per the rules, once answered, that character's story finished. I did this inspired by the Jason Morningstar and Matthijs Holter partnership Archipelago games "Last Train Out of Warsaw" and "Love in the Time of Seith". The players really loved this too; it really heightened the mystery and anticipation of the game to an extraordinary degree. <br/><br/>Five, I allowed "secondary players", much like the Moons in Ben Lehman's "Polaris", that had no role other than to play bit parts and help with the setting. The <a href="http://whereareyourkeys.org" rel="nofollow">WAYK game's</a> "Lunatic Fringe" technique inspired this. I also allowed "paired" character ownership, so that players could tag team for one character and retain a lot of energy and comfort with play.<br/><br/>Things I'd change for next time: <br/><br/>Less characters, more secondary players.<br/><br/>More destiny "loaded questions" for each player; players could only choose one, but had a difficult time to the rich variety of questions that other players wrote.<br/><br/>Change the process of "I See You"; rather than saying "I don't see it" and ending the game, use Archipelago's "Try something different" and keep going. Go two or three rounds around the table, until the player says "Finished".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298847/#Comment_298847" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-30T16:45:26+00:00" title="October 30, 2010  4:45PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2010 4:58PM by jdfristrom.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool - but how do you make "destiny loaded questions?"<br/><br/>That link to the warm-up games seemed to be broken but I found them here:<br/><a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2009/04/calling-world-warm-up-games-character.html" rel="nofollow">http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2009/04/calling-world-warm-up-games-character.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298860/#Comment_298860" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-30T22:02:59+00:00" title="October 30, 2010 10:02PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2010 10:04PM by willem.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie-<br/><br/>Thanks for the corrected link!<br/><br/>Making destiny "loaded questions" was pretty easy. I gave the instructions that all the other players submit to each player-character one loaded question that they would need to answer by the end of the game, such as "why did Bob marry the princess?", "why doesn't Bob know he is a demigod?". Something that assumes a lot while leaving a lot open in the discovery. Below are two real examples from the game:<br/><br/>For Hortensia Dreamrider, a blond-haired horse whisperer from the island of Fyn, players submitted the following questions (with the one the player selected has an asterisk*)-<br/>"What magical union created the child that became Hortensia, and why doesn't she know it?"*<br/>"How come no one has met any of Hortensia's relatives, nor remembers her as a child?"<br/>"Why did Hortensia's father teach her to make tattoos?"<br/>"Who is the small child who suddenly appears in Hortensia's dream?"<br/>"Why does Hortensia believe Stanley is responsible for the death of her twin sister?"<br/><br/>For Nathaniel Hawthorne, graduate student at the School of Piracy in the coastal city of Newport, on the island of Grohn:<br/>"How did Nathaniel Hawthorne become the heir to the Pirate school?"<br/>"Why did Nathaniel Hawthorne duel and kill his brother?"*<br/>"What series of events caused NH to consider a career in piracy?"<br/>"Does Nathaniel Hawthorne know that his brother is in fact still alive?"<br/>"How does Nathaniel Hawthorne react to the news that his mother has been admitted into an insane asylum?"<br/><br/>[Note: similarity among the submitted questions are entirely coincidental - there was no discussion or negotiation, players just wrote what came into their minds]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298864/#Comment_298864" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-31T00:31:14+00:00" title="October 31, 2010 12:31AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the "Help" ritual phrase!

I had two pairs on one character each, and another player had no character ownership. With 6 characters, this was bit overwhelming - it wasn't terrible, but the rounds were talking a while. Since each player-character directs a scene, and players without main characters don't, but every player gives input into every scene, my thought for next time is to have less player-characters, and more players without  main character ownership. <br/><br/>We'll go around the table in less time, and yet still have a lot of input for each scene. This worked well; players who had no character ownership, and just provided setting and "extras casting", had a lot of fun. <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of disconnecting character monogamy, but it did seem to work for shy players putting their toes in the water. Next time, with a hesitant player, I would prefer to have them be a permanent "Moon"-style player (as in Polaris) with no main character, rather than pair on a character. This is just due to my personal taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299155/#Comment_299155" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-03T11:35:33+00:00" title="November  3, 2010 11:35AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i've bee trying to think of something insightful to say, that doesn't simply repet what I commented on Willem's blog. So, I'll start with a piece of what I cmmented on Willem's blog. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><i>I\u2019m very excited about the techniques you\u2019ve developed. It sounds like you\u2019ve found solutions to some of the difficulties we\u2019ve both wrestled with in pursuit of <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/fluency-play/" rel="nofollow">Fluency Play</a>. Hand signs for Archipelago\u2019s phrases is obvious but inspired. And I\u2019ve always loved running \u201cI see you\u201d at the outset of any story game to bring the characters to life. I\u2019m intrigued by your idea to change \u201cI don\u2019t see it\u201d to \u201ctry something different.\u201d I\u2019ve always felt that running until someone \u201cfails\u201d to see it \u201cright\u201d was a bit of a downer in an otherwise beautiful exercise.<br/><br/>Also, changing the destiny statements into questions sounds delightful. I too have been inspired by Love in the Time of Sei\xf0\u2019s use of questions, and for that matter Montsegur 1244. I\u2019m more about questions than answers, these days.<br/><br/>But I\u2019m especially excited about the \u201cHelp\u201d and \u201csecondary players\u201d techniques! These are both things I\u2019ve struggled with in playing story games, especially when introducing them to new players. I\u2019ve never known how to give a new player support when they falter or freeze\u2013I don\u2019t want to take over or rob them of their opportunity, so I generally just wait it out and try to look encouraging. \u201cHelp\u201d sounds like it gives players a means of soliciting aid without embarrassing themselves or breaking flow. Brilliant!</i><br/><br/>I also asked Willem what techniques he used to make "Secondary Players" work, because I'd previously <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/fluency-in-the-forest/" rel="nofollow">tried something like this</a> and found that the secondary players didn't have much to do or much investment in what's going on.<br/><br/>Willem's answer:\n<blockquote>\u201cSecondary players\u201d: I had a problem, and as you know, when I have a problem, I try to make lemonade. I had too many interested players, some who actually had puppy dog \u201cgosh, I can\u2019t play too?\u201d looks on their face. I had no problem keeping them engaged, they wanted badly to participate. I more needed to figure out \u201chow do I catch this energy they\u2019re offering and respect it?\u201d.<br/><br/>Now, I don\u2019t know exactly what information you need about facilitating these secondary players. If you wanted to know how I provided them with ways to contribute, during one player\u2019s scene all the other players essentially fill \u201csecondary player\u201d roles. So secondary players, for the whole game, always had company, and essentially participated the same as everyone else, except for the single active player-character.<br/><br/>Think of it much like Polaris and the role of the Moons - same exact thing.<br/><br/>One step up from this in terms of commitment, came the paired players for one character. This seems another way to heighten engagement without heightening commitment too much.</blockquote>\nSo it sounds like Acrhipelago and Willem's other techniques produced a great synergy that kept everyone involved and contribting.

All the setup was good times - for setting, she suggested "lego castle", "toothpick castle", and I kept saying "" - then my wife, who overheard us from the kitchen, suggested "Spanish castle" - since Sofia's into Spanish these days, and I was all, "Oh, like Toledo?" and I showed Sofia some images from google and she agreed they were cool so I printed out a map and we were good to go.  She's playing a teenage witch whose mother has disappeared, I'm playing a knight who was friends with the mother.  We played the "I see you" game and she was great at coming up with stuff for that.  Another idea of hers, probably because we've been playing Costume Quest on the Xbox lately - it's Halloween night in medieval times.  (What that was actually like, I have no idea, so we're making it up rather than doing research.)<br/><br/>The awesome bit:  when coming up with destiny questions, I told her, "Ok, so my flags are I'm trying to help find your mother too, and I'm trying to serve the lord of the castle," and she said, "You should have to choose between finding my mother and serving the lord of the castle."<br/><br/>That's my girl!<br/><br/>Actually playing was problematic, though.  She needs more structure.  I have to ask increasingly leading questions.  "What do you do?"  "I don't know"  "Well, do you go trick-or-treating or look for you mother?"  "I go trick-or-treating."  ""  "I don't know."  But if I'm patient she gets there:  "Well, where did you last see your mother?  What was she doing when she disappeared?"  "She was walking around the block."  "What did she have?"  "Nothing."  " - if she had something, maybe she dropped it and it can be a clue."  "Ok, a bag.  She was walking to the park at the end of the block."<br/><br/>As our destiny demanded, she discovered that her mom, also a witch, had been taken to the castle but left a candy circle portal (magic that only works on Halloween - Sofia owns magic) when she was captured, and sent her bag back on Halloween night so she could find her.  It honestly didn't occur to me until my guy saw her mom in prison - but the lord must be rounding up all the witches and wizards.  <br/><br/>Sofi can't wait to play more, but she has a birthday party to go to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301365/#Comment_301365" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T23:59:42+00:00" title="November 18, 2010 11:59PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, amazing to play this with your five-year-old.

When she discovered her family was captured, she visited them via candy circle portal, and they said, "Run child!"  And when I discovered what my lord was up to, I first tried reasoning with him, and then took the teenage witch and escaped the city.  That wrapped up our destinies for the first session.  Now I'm consorting with a playwright's demon to figure out how to free her family, and a cartographer has stolen her magic wand (Fate card - trying to figure out how geography could cause her a loss).<br/><br/>Us, we tend to play in the same setting until I get ground down with boredom - I read her Warriors (she was really too young for it, though, whoops) and our roleplaying was about clan cats for months.  In fact, I was surprised she didn't want to do clan cats with Archipelago.<br/><br/>I've also played online some since then, though haven't finished a session.  <a href="http://infrno.net/jdfristrom/games/422#comment_1283?utm_source=sendgrid.com&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=website" rel="nofollow">Check this out.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
