There's no guarantee it will work (either getting the game played nor whether they will enjoy it), but hey, I thought I'd try.<br/><br/>Are there any thoughts for a n00b facilitator leading a group of guys who never play RPG's?  I get the impression its fairly non-rp-gamer friendly, but any handy advice for getting jumpstarted, maintaining pace and pitfalls to avoid?<br/><br/>And I presume one round of "lensing" would be about right for a group like mine?  How many rounds do y'all typically do?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368069/#Comment_368069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T06:12:15+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  6:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 6:14AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aaarg_ink</cite>Are there any thoughts for a n00b facilitator leading a group of guys who never play RPG's?

Keep feedback to a minimum.  A little table chatter is cool, but when it's your turn to lay down a card, you shouldn't be polling for ideas or approval.  Part of the game's charm is seeing the unpredictable things other people lay down and figuring out what the rest of the table would find intriguing, and fishing for ideas also just eats up time.  Don't be too afraid to lay down something you think might be lame (you never know who might build on it), or even to lay down something you don't understand!  It can be really interesting to put down cards that name specific people or things without knowing exactly who or what they are, and then having other people define them later.<br/><br/>2. Keep scenes on-topic.  Again, a little digression is fine, but every scene is explicitly framed around a question, and everyone should be pushing towards answering it.  Having someone play Time can be useful for this.\n<blockquote>And I presume one round of "lensing" would be about right for a group like mine?

That usually takes us 2-3 hours.  Last time I played we had six, and it took us three 3-4 hour sessions to give everyone one shot at being the Lens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368076/#Comment_368076" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T06:40:16+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  6:40AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The text includes a chapter that you can read aloud to teach the game to yourself and others. I'd recommend reading that through and using it for that purpose. One Lens round seems like a good intro. When I've played, we've shot for having each person get to do one Focus round. In games with 6 or so people, that wasn't close to possible in a 4 hour session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368358/#Comment_368358" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T14:10:14+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  2:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2012 2:10PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I highly recommend taking turns reading the rules aloud. The text is intentionally very brief so it works quite well. That's how I do it now when I play.<br/><br/>Because Microscope is different than most other role-playing games there's _a lot_ to explain or unlearn. Letting the book do the heavy-lifting for you lets you focus more on playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
