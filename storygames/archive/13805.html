When it came to the mechanics, though, it didn't seem like they were contributing to the fun. I got the impression that they didn't want to put each other "on the spot" to take the judge role for their scenes, so they invented their technique of using dice to select. They were also obviously frustrated at times when the game structure didn't allow them to have other players respond in-character to what they were doing in their scene.<br/><br/>It didn't seem like the group having fun when the dice told any of them that their scenes didn't happen. Most of the time the next person in line felt obligated to "rescue" the lost scene by using their turn to bring it back. Even when scenes officially didn't happen (e.g. the body had a bruise on the back of the head) they acted as if they did (finding hair product on the butt of one of the guns). It's not clear to me what this mechanic is supposed to contribute to the game: If you're playing in a friendly and solicitous way, why do you want to shoot down your friends contributions? And if you're playing in a cutthroat way won't most of the contributions end up getting completely shot down, making the game creatively exhausting (or maybe repetitive, if you keep pitching the same idea until it sticks)? Is judging the probability of someone's scene supposed to be enjoyable? To me, they all sounded a little uncomfortable when they had to do it. I know I wouldn't enjoy it -- I really dislike using arbitrary judgment to set target numbers in games.<br/><br/>The "do you want to try to veto some scenes?" mechanic never got engaged. This has the same "do you really want to shoot down your friends' contributions?" problem, but it also has an added logistical burden of trying to recall which scenes are potentially veto-able, keeping them distinct from each other, and (if you actually used it) making it stick -- stories stick in people's minds much more strongly than bits of information like "that didn't happen". Whenever they got to that point in the mechanics I was glad they chose not to use it since I would have been completely unable to keep track of what was going on if they had, and I suspect I would have felt the same way if I had been playing.<br/><br/>The lack of structure of the game seemed to be a bit problematic. There was nothing pushing them toward a resolution. Relying on one player to create a scene that ends things has the same "do you want your friends to stop being creative now?" problem -- who wants to be the bad guy in that context? As they said at the end, they could have kept going forever. Identifying a suspect and an heir seemed to be afterthoughts -- they were much more interested in hamming it up (which was fun for me to listen to, especially from Anim and Nikki who embrace that kind of thing, and judging from their laughter was fun for all of them, too) than in resolving the scenario. Do you think that's a problem with the game?<br/><br/>There seemed to be a bit of a disconnect between what you could do in the various rooms and what they wanted to do in the stories. For example, Nikki/Goldie was frustrated because it didn't seem like there was a legal way for her to tell Anim/Ace about someone else's motive. To talk about motives she needs to be in the bedroom, to talk to Ace she needs to be wherever Ace is. The strong link between tasks and rooms seemed a little strange.<br/><br/>In your scene mechanics, I think it's a bit creatively intimidating to ask a person to tell a story (anything you want!) on the spot. You could hear a lot of discomfort and nervous laughter in the beginning when the rules were telling them to do that. From reading some of your posts I get the impression that you think this is a good mechanic for people new to story games, but I think this mechanic would make me very uncomfortable if I was coming to a game like this fresh.<br/><br/>I'm sure this comes across as very negative. I don't mean to bash you or your game, but I'm concerned that you focus a lot on other possible causes for your lack of market success (e.g. not having a "sales force") when game design issues may be what's holding you back. Like I said, your premise and characters obviously connected with them, but I'm not sure the rest of the game is firing on all cylinders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312709/#Comment_312709" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T14:07:11+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  2:07PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is certainly foord for thought. Rough grissly food - good nutrition but hard to swallow. I do see the conflict the players are having. I've seen this for years and thought it would pass as more people played. Obviously that is not happening.<br/><br/>I guess part of my inner conflict is I like the total creative make it on the spot mechanics. I'm a psychotherapist and this kind of thinking is what I do all day long - I like it - yes it is challenging but when people are there crying I engage it rather than nervously laugh and shy away. In MGs I can make a move that totally sets another player up to go down hard. I expect they will contradict me and that the dice will sink of save one of us. It is hard to accept that that isn't the way most people work. <br/><br/>I do have some timing mechanics that I use in other games - action tokens. And I'm thinking about ways to allow players to act without making up scenes but rewrding them if they do make scenes. <br/><br/>I will really have to think about these weakness - since they are weaknesses for most players- to see what I can do about them. I'm having my Hamster Press meeting tonight - probably by myself again - so I'll have time to mull this over. <br/><br/>Thank you for the input - as I said all feedback is good.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313008/#Comment_313008" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T05:30:28+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  5:30AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay - I've been thinking about the feedback and I think I can make some changes that address parts of it. <br/><br/>I know I'm not giving up a dice roll. At some deep philosophical level I just don't believe in an automatic success. I'll give that to God but not to humans. I have increased the base roll to 8 or less in my new games (not what Mark was running) so there is already a 72% chance of success. I want to keep the referee being able to move that up or down so that players who make stupid world wrecking moves can be totally shot down. Just knowing that they can be given a 2% chance stops a lot of sillyness. <br/><br/>Remembering what has happened in a turn - the diffuculty there of - is a great point. Personally I can remember long strings of events but it is one of those things I was trained to do in grad school. Back in the mid 80's social workers were trained to do process reporting. I was able to write verbatim what was said in an hour long session after the fact. I can't do that now but I still can remember more than most people because of that training. I'd like to blame the internet for people having shorter attention spans but really people have never been able to remember very well. Also you are right that the final veto mechanic is clunky. <br/><br/>So....<br/><br/>I think I will have a single player make an action/scene aand roll for it (paying a token to do this - so the tokens time the game). Other players may pay a token to make a counter-argument if they don't want that to happen. As many people as want may join in. Then they do a second roll - high roller wins. Maybe the winner can decide other counter-arguments also happen. Then the turn ends. Move on around the table to the next player to start the next turn. That should handle the flow and memory issue.<br/><br/>As to the referee floating - You know it is actually fun to ref once you've done it. I've face the intimidation problem to making up scenes as judging actions forever but I've seen again and again that after one or two turns it vanishes. It is like the difficulty story gamers have with getting D20 players to make scenes. It is a paradigm shift. It is important to me that my games help people make this shift because it feeds back into our daily lives because it frees up creativity in other fields. I'm a lot more empowered now as a person for having played Matrix Games. I've seen children and mentally retarded people be able to play and do well. All they have to do is give themselves permission to make stuff up. It isn't that hard and it isn't cheating. <br/><br/>The problem with people only being able to do certain actions in certain rooms was actually the players mishearing the rules. The event suggestions in each room were there to help people know what kind of things would be good to do. In this regard the rooms worked because it taught the players to look for motives, alibis, etc. Actuall you can do anything anywhere with a scene. The skills, encounters, etc. are just inspirations. <br/><br/>The same is true about players being able to do role plays with one another. Mark did not tell them but the rules say that during movement players may talk, form teams, make strategies or do inpromtu role plays between their characters (all of which happen in the game). <br/><br/>When people picked up other player's failed actions and made them happen - that is perfectly okay in the game. It just meant that the player who first made the action did a great job and influenced people by their witt. <br/><br/>I don think that making a turn consist of one person acting and other making counter-arguments will smooth over a lot of these rough edges but people being intimidated about making stuff up, I can't do much about that. The heart of the game is that freedom. If it is too much for people then I will never sell much but I honestly don't think it is. <br/><br/>I'll continue thinking about your feed back though and see if I can come up with more improvements. I was hard to hear but I know it makes me and my game better. One always wants to be liked unconditionally - but that isn't how the adult world works. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313048/#Comment_313048" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T10:36:07+00:00" title="February 17, 2011 10:36AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, I'm glad you're taking this in the spirit it was intended.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>I know I'm not giving up a dice roll. At some deep philosophical level I just don't believe in an automatic success. I'll give that to God but not to humans.</blockquote>\nYou might want to look at alternatives to the all-or-nothing mechanic you've got right now -- I think my negative reaction is related to the cost of the failure (you lose your entire creative contribution) rather than that there's a chance of failure. There are other ways to have uncertainty, etc. For example, you might consider Polaris-style negotiation as part of the mechanic. Or something else entirely. They did seem to enjoy the ability to put a twist on another player's scene, the part I had trouble with was that they seemed to be doing it out of a sense of obligation and had to give up their own turn to do it. I'm not looking to have you replace your design aesthetic with mine, I just want to challenge you a bit to make sure you've explored all the tools you have at your disposal to achieve your vision.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>It is important to me that my games help people make this shift because it feeds back into our daily lives because it frees up creativity in other fields.</blockquote>\nIf you can articulate it, I'd be interested in hearing what you want people to take back to their lives and what parts of your games are key in delivering that. I'm especially interested in the "judging" part. Do you want people to be better judges of fiction? Of evaluating the likelihood of someone's story being true or false? Personally, I really hate "GM assigns target number arbitrarily" mechanics, but I really liked the way Mouse Guard did it with the factors that go into figuring out the Obstacle for skill tests. It takes an element of subjectivity and responsibility for the result out of the process and is far more pleasant to engage in. I can talk about that more if you want, but if your goal in the game is to expose people to that feeling of arbitrary judgment then there may not be much point.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>The problem with people only being able to do certain actions in certain rooms was actually the players mishearing the rules.</blockquote>\nOK, that makes sense. Hopefully seeing how this group misinterpreted those rules will be useful data for you for future designs.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>but people being intimidated about making stuff up, I can't do much about that. The heart of the game is that freedom. If it is too much for people then I will never sell much but I honestly don't think it is.</blockquote>\nWell, I'm not sure it's exactly that black and white. The "blank page problem" is a real thing. It's a lot easier to be creative in some contexts than in others. My take on RPGs or story games is that one of the main points of designing them is to make that subjective barrier to creating fiction seem lower to the participants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313495/#Comment_313495" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T07:17:08+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  7:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a cross post I put up over at the RPG Crossroads:<br/><br/>Dan Maruschak listened to the Guilty Moneybags play session on the Gutter Skypes and sent me some very useful - critical - feedback on the flow of the game. He noted the whiff problem and how players rescued one another's actions by ignoring the dice and subsumming the failed argument in their next scene. He also noted how the veto system put the players on the spot - no one wanted to be the bad guy and say no to anyone's narration. He found it hard to remember all the actions that had happened in a turn to be able to decide if any needed to be vetoed. He found the game lacking in structure and the requirement to make up a story on the spot and having to judge other player's narrations to set a "Chance to happen number" creatively intimidating and arbitrary. All hard to hear but useful to hear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I've been grappling with making the game better for years and made many changes - so its time to make a few more!<br/><br/><br/><br/>I had already increased the basic chance to happen roll to 8 or less on 2d6 (72%) and recommended that new referees/game hosts only move chances up or stay the same till they become more comfortable with their judgment. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Remembering the up to six actions that can happen in a single turn problem is one that I'm glad Dan made clear to me. I'm personally very good at remembering strings of narration and can tell them appart and decipher meaning from them. I'm a psychotherapist in my day job and I do this every day - often with tears added. Most people don't exercise those mental muscles as often as I do so I really should not require that skill as a basic need of play. At some level my old manness wants to say "Damned kids and their internet rotting their brains" but that isn't fair - I would have had trouble with this when I was in college and there was no internet then. The fix I can immediately see is to make a turn be one player's scene plus any counter-arguments made to it. The mechanics of the rules stay the same - it is just narrowing down what people have to remember. Players will have a set number of action tokens so they will have to make a judgment whither this scene is worth using up a limited resource. The action tokens also time limits games so they should have more focus. <br/><br/><br/><br/>I can't do anything about people feeling uncomfortable making stuff up on the spot. They games already contain a LOT of ideas and suggestions - the pod cast doesn't not refelct all the support material - skills and encounters in rooms are only two of the things there to help players decide what to do. I want the game to allow players to freely make up a story - without saying there is one optimal course of action. I don't believe there is one right answer and to avoid doing that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I can do something about putting players on the spot to be referees. I think I should make one player the referee. This should be the game host - and they should probably not run a character. To make this role more fun though. I will allow them to add modifications to player's scenes (with the player's consent) before they set the reality check roll. In this way they take a little ownership of the scene and it is a great way a player can bribe  the referee to get a better roll. So it decreases whiff, and increases cooperation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The challenge of creating a fun structure in a game remains. Some games have obvious structures like finding clues in murder mystery games, arresting a suspect and putting them on trial. My new games this year play around with a couple of other stuctures. I never know if they are good or not usually until afterwards. For instance - this reworking of rules made me look back at all my old games and I found my dungeon games from last year just missing something. I was not hooked as I reread them. Going into a dungeon to crush monsters - yawn - but the bad guy wanting the heroes to get powerful as a way to corrupt them - interesting. I took that idea and did a full rewrite of the rules. So the critical feedback is helping me look at the whole line - not just the one game. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end I can't say if Matrix Games will ever resonate like a hit game does. But I will keep working on it and make it better. I will continue to build up a local organization for Hamster Press, and I'll keep working on the technical side of production because I don't want to just write games anymore, I want to sell them in stores. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313519/#Comment_313519" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T10:16:01+00:00" title="February 21, 2011 10:16AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I had already increased the basic chance to happen roll to 8 or less on 2d6 (72%) and recommended that new referees/game hosts only move chances up or stay the same till they become more comfortable with their judgment.

Even with versions of your core mechanic ( including straight singler d6 rolls from earlier versions), I noticed that there was really a need to give a GM/Ref/Player acting as Ref for the roll some kind of starting point guidelines, and also some good practical limits/advice on shifting the probability for a given roll.<br/><br/>One of the things I also considered was giving some advice/guidelines when their instinct was to shift the probabilty up or down more than one number. I really felt that, especially with the straight d6 spread, that if the Ref was going to shift up or down more than one spot, something else needed to happen, usually some sort of interaction with the player who would be rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313604/#Comment_313604" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T05:20:17+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  5:20AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to let this thread die but last night I got to thinking - "If you're raising the roll to 8 to increase the number of actions that happen, why not go to 9? 83% is better than 72% and the host still has a little room to go up and can always go down."<br/><br/>Bob - what do you think?<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313619/#Comment_313619" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T07:13:21+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  7:13AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Full disclosure:<br/>I haven't looked closely at that version of the mechanics.<br/><br/>Here's what I was working on a while back for the staright d6 roll version.<br/><br/><i>When it's your turn to set the number needed for a roll, do these things</i><br/><br/>If you think the suggested action or actions probably <b>would</b> occur, make success 3+ (occurs on 3,4,5 or 6)<br/>If you think the suggested action or actions probably <b>wouldn'</b>t occur, make success 4+ ( occurs on 4, 5,or 6)<br/><br/>(side note: I ws going to make a graphic, just a tool bar numbered with a place for a marker to show all this, and make modification shifts easier)<br/><br/><i>Now modify the roll</i><br/>There are three categories to consider when modifying a roll: What the genre says should happen, what reality says should happen, and what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU</span> WANT to happen.<br/>Go through the categories one at a time. If you feel a category would influence the roll positively ( make it more likely), shift the marker to the left ( going to a lower number). If the category would make the events less likely to occur or actions to succeed, move it one place right  to a higher number. If you think the category would have no effect, that's a zero modifier, so don't move the marker at all.<br/><br/>As you shift the marker, you must tell the player about to make the roll why you are shifting the marker and what category the modifier falls under.<br/><br/>Shifting must stop at 2+ for very likely events, or 6+ for very unlikley events.<br/><br/>If shifts would take the roll down to 1 or up to 7, place a consequences marker on that number. That means that a failure has direct negative consequences.<br/><br/>In the case of a 7, things are already out of hand. Have all other players suggest an outcome for failure, then have the judging player pick one of those as the failure outcome <b>before</b> the die is rolled. The judging player and the rolling player may make suggestions as well. MOve the marker back to 6, and have the player roll.<br/><br/>In the case of a shift down to 1, place the marker back on 2. In this case, it seems like everything is going exactly right. It would be boring if there was no danger however. In this case, roll the die as normal, but if a failure comes up ( only on a 1), every player suggests possible reasons that the seemingly very likely event did not occur as planned ( possibly succeeding but with losses or long gterm consequences), and the failing player makes another roll to randomly decide between them.<br/>____________________<br/><br/>Anyway, that was my way of hybridizing your basic mechanic with some dirtyhippy concepts, while stiucking to a single roll perr player turn.<br/><br/>Couple things to note: I've added in the category of "What the judging player wants to see happen" as a disclosure thing. With your systems, I think a lot of folks balk a little from the classic fear of the biased GM. Here, I want folks to face that as a fact of play, on both sides of a roll.<br/><br/>The limitation of 2-5 with consequences on either end was simply to crunch down some of your earlier multiple success rules, which just seemed kind of overly cruel to me, even to players asking way too much or badly misunderstanding the tone of play.<br/><br/>Somewhere, I have an earlier version that also allowed players with shifts into really unlikely territroy one renegotiation attempt, in order to bring the odds back down to a managable level.<br/><br/>Not sure if any of that helps you with the current mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
