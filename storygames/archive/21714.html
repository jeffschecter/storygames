And\u2026<br/><br/>His PC, that he had played one session with, was left at work last time. So he rolled up a new char and we were hanging out with another player, eating dumplings, rolling up lifepaths, siblings etc etc. And that new char died to BRD right away.<br/><br/>Now I saw his orig PC\u2026 and why it was so unlucky that he didn't get to have it the first time they met the raptors. This orig PC has great armor mastery and some Goliath-specific ability, he can shrug off a horde of weenie attacks easily!!! He would've had a chance to show off his build, except instead he lost a really cool blink-lev PC. But, he managed to not tip his hand, he just said, after his initial upset after the BRD, that I should make sure to keep the raptors on the enc table.<br/><br/>I sometimes say that it's not always about what you do in battle, but what you bring to bear. And today they rolled raptors again and easily defeated them.<br/><br/>That's another type of agency, the build agency. The multi-dimensional rock-paper-scissors\u2026 tank vs mobile vs spells vs etc etc etc                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475029/#Comment_475029" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-26T23:29:25+00:00" title="June 26, 2018 11:29PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A very interesting follow-up to the story!
