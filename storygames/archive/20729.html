It's no coincidence; I've always felt more comfortable writing quite rigid, almost board-gamey rules structures, and Shinobigami really showed me that it's possible to structure a fun, energetic game that generates great fiction around a simple structured rules-first approach.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to talk about Blade Bind on Storygames for a while now, because I think it may appeal to a lot of people here, but I've been holding back because I didn't really need any help with the rules and didn't want to seem like a scummy self-promoter. But now that I've got the game in its almost-final form, I'm bursting with enthusiasm and want to tell everyone about it! Its direct storygame ancestry can be traced back to Shinobigami (basic approach), Eternal Contenders (GMless, fighting, card-based) and Wield (the concept of weapons "wielding" their heroes).<br/><br/>Blade Bind is set in the modern world (although it's largely setting agnostic), but where people with strong convictions can attract the attention of powerful supernatural entities known as Blades. A Blade manifests as a six foot long sword with a giant eye. It will offer to give you the power to achieve your goals, and if you make a deal with it you become one of the Chosen \u2014 someone with the power to raze a skyscraper or an army, and who can shrug off the effects of lesser weaponry. Only another of the Chosen can stand in your way.<br/><br/>The game is GMless, designed for one-shots, character-vs-character, eschews "stats and skills" for "relationships and goals", has a power-vs-control gauge that inexorably steers you towards self-destruction, and uses a deck of regular playing cards to resolve Duels \u2014\xa0which are the only form of mechanised conflict resolution.<br/><br/>The setup is a bit like Fiasco. You end up with a complex, conflicted situation, and the game explodes out of the blocks from the first scene. While there is a gradual build-up of Power as the game progresses, the stakes are high right from the beginning.<br/><br/>The duelling system is informed by my several years' experience learning historical European martial arts (specifically, the English backsword of George Silver, but the Blades are more like longswords). I've worked hard to make an abstracted system that really gives the feel of the back-and-forth of an actual swordfight without bogging down in fiddly details. Whoever wins the fight gets to either decide the fate of a focal plot device, or they can rewrite a goal for themselves or one of their defeated foes. This is a bit like rewriting Fates in Tenra Bansho Zero, in that it's a mechanical choice that creates new motivations and a revised picture of who your character is.<br/><br/>I've done quite a bit of internal playtesting, including white-room tests of the duelling system and the Special Techniques each Blade has, and also several full-length games. I'm at the point where I'm happy with the current form of the rules, and I've even done most of the layout. I still have several illustrations to do, as well as the final record sheet, and I'm playing about with setting up a custom deck of cards. <br/><br/>I'm strongly considering running a small Kickstarter for it in the next few months, using DriveThruRPG's at-cost coupons to keep things as simple as possible for my first Kickstarter, and to keep the final costs as low as possible for the backers. I partly want to run a Kickstarter so I can crowdsource a bunch of eyes on the rules and hopefully get some feedback from external playtesting so I can polish the book to a shine before I release the PDF and POD versions to the public. I'd love to raise enough money to pay for an editor, but apart from that, the KS would mostly be a pre-order system.<br/><br/>So... yeah! That's where I'm up to. I don't really have any questions for you guys, but if anyone likes the sound of it and would like to know more, I'd love to talk about it and answer your questions! I would also welcome any advice or feedback on my Kickstarter plans. I'm not too fussed if it doesn't fund though, as I can always finish the book off and release it myself like I did with my last game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455368/#Comment_455368" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-29T05:56:52+00:00" title="July 29, 2016  5:56AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds very cool, and I like your approach in pitching the game with such a detailed write-up.<br/><br/>Do you have any materials for us to look at - handouts, summaries, excerpts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shiro" title="Shiro"><img alt="Shiro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shiro">Shiro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455370/#Comment_455370" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-29T07:04:43+00:00" title="July 29, 2016  7:04AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2016 7:05AM by Shiro.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

That's the Final Beta; I've since moved the working draft over to InDesign, where I've done 95% of the layout work and reviewed/rewritten/edited the text a few more times.

Completed Threads give you a big Will boost, Threads in-progress give you a bit less, and Threads that are no longer possible to achieve give you no Will at all. You also start with a few free points.<br/><br/>You get Power from your Blade. You start with a little, but the Blade tempts you to get more at the start of each Duel. Power determines how many cards you draw, and it's a lot harder to win if you start with a card deficit.<br/><br/>The problem is, if your Power ever exceeds your Will, the Blade takes over and you become Bladebound. You'll go about destroying the things you once cared about, and then try to kill the character wielding your Blade's ancient enemy.<br/><br/>Winning a duel lets you achieve one of your goals or rewrite a Thread belonging to yourself or one of those you defeated. While this often increases your own Will, there are ripple effects on other people's Will \u2013\xa0for example, if it's your goal to destroy an artefact, but another character's goal to protect it, then destroying it will raise your Will while causing theirs to plummet.<br/><br/>So you have a mess of conflicting goals, and you need to reach for more Power in order to secure your Threads, but at the same time your Will will be fluctuating as everyone else acts at cross-purposes, so you have to be careful how far you push it in case you go over the edge!<br/><br/>That's the detailed answer; I hope it addresses your question! The TL:DR version is, I guess: the duelling system is an engaging and thematic way to decide who has final narrative rights in a given scene, and it only gets used if the characters can't agree on how things should go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455432/#Comment_455432" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T00:43:50+00:00" title="August  2, 2016 12:43AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What are instructions to the players regarding what they should advocate for?

I also advise gaming the system as much as you want, because much like Fates in Tenra Bansho Zero, playing to the mechanics creates fictional output and leads to character development.<br/><br/>I think you can approach it from either a character-centric or mechanics-centric point of view. Threads are rigidly structured, not freeform. They act as strong indicators of what you should be trying to achieve, and if you manage to get on top of them all then you have the luxury of being able to look around and figure out how you can manipulate everyone else's Threads in your favour.<br/><br/>There are some emergent properties of the system that I don't want to spell out explicitly in the text. Some of that is in the Duelling rules, and some is in the way Threads, Will, and Power interact. I think if people approach the game at the surface level, following their Threads and just trying to do the best they can for their character, it still creates a good play experience. But once you've seen a game through, you get a better understanding of how you might manipulate the situation to your advantage.<br/><br/>I spell out in the expectations of play that it's not about winning, but about creating and savouring the drama. So even if your character does really badly and dies, it's still an enjoyable \u2013\xa0if bittersweet \u2013\xa0experience if you approach it that way.

I'd contrast it with "Nordic-style" story games, where the structure is more open and exploratory, and even though there might be conflict rules, it's up to you when to engage in them, and many scenes are set just to establish or explore the characters and their relationships.<br/><br/>I'm not at all sure this is a reasonable set of labels; it's just my associations. Jason Morningstar's games are generally solidly in the "American-style" genre to me, for example.\n<blockquote>I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "scheduled conflicts", though..? Do you mean the way it pushes toward end-game deathmatches between Bladebound, or that the only way to change things is to fight about it?</blockquote>\nReskimming the game, I may be projecting a bit, but I get the feeling that you generally set a scene with the conflict already in mind, as opposed to setting a scene and seeing what happens, escalating to a conflict only if the fiction happens to guide you in that direction.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shiro" title="Shiro"><img alt="Shiro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shiro">Shiro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455448/#Comment_455448" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T13:28:22+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  1:28PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2016 1:29PM by Shiro.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see. Yeah, most of the time I suppose a conflict is effectively inevitable. The Focus will choose a goal to shoot for, and the other players decide if it's worth standing in their way. If nobody has a connection to the goal, or if they don't think it's worth fighting over for whatever reason, then the Focus simply achieves it. That is, most of the time you're saying "I'm going to do <b>this</b>. Is anyone going to try and stop me?"<br/><br/>You can try to talk out a scene rather than coming in swords blazing, though. It's possible to persuade another character to adopt a different course of action (including changing their Threads or surrendering control of a "Knot" plot-device) through roleplaying alone. But if the negotiations fail or reach an impasse, you have two options: drop it, or draw your Blade and try to impose your will on the situation. <br/><br/>I've seen people try to negotiate in multiple playtests; sometimes it works, occasionally they back down, and often it comes to swords drawn.<br/><br/>Incidentally, your American-style definition there fits Shinobigami to a tee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455456/#Comment_455456" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T17:38:04+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  5:38PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear, I'm not saying this is a bad thing.
