I think players like my games because I throw a lot of hooks at them (most of them improvised) and then slowly yank them forward, bit by bit, mystery by mystery. Sort of like how shows with lots of cliffhangers (True Blood, Lost, Damages...) keep you interested. Also, I've gotten praise for handing out a lot of cool stuff...there was this one old D&amp;D steampunk campaign where I made a big colour map for the game and had mockup one-page victorian newspaper prints which revealed setting info and plot hooks.<br/>One of the GMs we have is very good at immersion somehow. I don't know how he does it, but I always feel in-world when he's running. But he has this "GM's story" thing going on...at least he had when I last played with him. This other GM is quite good with numbers (something I'm completely crap with) and is subsequently good at making carefully balanced encounters...but he can get crazy with weird puzzles and his games are often a "point-and-click" affair. We have one guy who's only started GMing fairly recently and he's very good, fun, inventive and spontaneous, because he doesn't have any baggage, but all I've seen him do is comedy, while I like some gravitas...<br/><br/>Wow, did I just derail this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257358/#Comment_257358" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-20T17:04:07+00:00" title="February 20, 2010  5:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course this is only my own opinion.<br/><br/>As a player:  I'm good with coming up with dynamic characters that fit well into the campaign at hand.

Most specifically, concept characters. If it's a system I'm intimately familiar with, I can tease possibly game-breaking mechanical efficacy out of the numbers, and still have it all make sense within the fiction, and fit the feel of the character. Usually, the character will be deeply rooted within the setting as well, assuming there's a setting to be deeply rooted in, and I have the requisite familiarity with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn play, I'm good at getting into character. I know that some people don't see that as important, but some people have three eyes and an ear in the center of their forehead, too. I can usually make tactical decisions without violating character. I can foreshadow and highlight things my character doesn't know without having their actions be based on that knowledge. I can, and frequently do, get so deeply into character that I'm emotionally wrung out at the end of a particularly good session. As a matter of fact, it wasn't a particularly good session if I didn't. Once, a non-gamer who'd gamed with us for the first time said he began to cease seeing me and start seeing the (female) character I was portraying.

I guess I mean that if it's the sort of game where my character has defining traits or a merit/flaw style sytem, I will go out of my way to play those. I have a friend who says 'never split the party!' when playing Call of Cthulhu, but lately I've taken to saying: 'Why not? It's what my character would do, and it's more interesting in this scenario.'<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be fair, while I enjoy the risk involved in this approach and know it can lead to a more interesting story, I -do- have a habit of getting annoyed about character death, particularly when it seems arbitrary, or pointless, or just doesn't satisfy the story in some way. That's part of the reason I'm drifting towards story games, or at least games with more story-focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to do well in Munchausen because whenever anyone has an objection or wager I always say 'yes' to it and incorporate it into the story, and it nearly always makes the story more entertaining as a result. Like when one particular Baron of mine had to argue his innocence in rhyming couplets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

She was playing a noble-hearted teacher lady, who was inspiring a rebellion in her students. Her final crime was inspiring one of her female students to take charge of the world, act out, create change and stand down to no one. The conditioning that followed was obvious, given her character and how it all played out: "I cannot stand up to men." The whole table saw it, knew that it was the option that made the most sense, was the most fitting. So, we let the dice fall. I won, on a tie.
