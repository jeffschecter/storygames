It must solve a problem.<br/><br/>If it doesn\u2019t fix, mend or alleviate a nagging pain, problem, condition or situation\u2014why would people want it, much less buy it? There must be a strong, recognizable and somewhat measurable or appreciable benefit to owning and using your product.<br/><br/>2. It must have mass appeal.<br/><br/>You may have invented the best mousetrap ever, but if only one in ten million homes has a mouse problem\u2026 you\u2019re not going to sell a heck of a lot of mouse traps. Sure, you can sell just a few at a ridiculously high price-point? But a mouse-trap priced at $50,000\u2026 how easy of a sale will that be?<br/><br/>3. It must be unique.<br/><br/>If it\u2019s the first or only one of its kind\u2014that\u2019s a homerun! If it\u2019s not, then it should at least be different and beneficial in a way that isn\u2019t currently offered. A rose by any other name is still a rose\u2014but a rose that never loses its petals, now that would be unique.<br/><br/>4. It must offer instant gratification.<br/><br/>If it\u2019ll only be of use next spring, why buy it today? People don\u2019t want to buy seeds. They want the fully grown tree, planted and providing shade now. We\u2019re an impatient nation of consumers. We don\u2019t want the fishing pole\u2014we want the fish fresh, filleted, seasoned and served.<br/><br/>5. It must be demonstrable.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a law of nature: seeing is believing. The customer must see with their own eyes how easily, quickly, and effectively your product does what it does. Though people will often say they can\u2019t trust their eyes\u2014they always do.</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> is where I started seeing how this could be relevant in a game demo on the con floor. Apparently Mr. Mays got his start as a boardwalk pitchman in Coney Island and I can't think of a closer analogy to that kind of sales environment.<br/><br/>For those hitting the floor at GenCon this year, what are your tips for demoing your games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221652/#Comment_221652" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T10:41:27+00:00" title="July 30, 2009 10:41AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, I'm not "hitting the floor" in the sense you mean it, though I suspect my feet will hit the floor hundreds of thousands of times that weekend. Still, I have played a couple dozen Forge Booth demos and helped improve a few.<br/><br/>This isn't my idea, but it has stuck with me: Your demo does not have to show the actual game. It has to demonstrate the experience of the game. Feel free to tell your demoers, "The actual game is more complicated than this, but I only have a few minutes of your time, so we're cutting some corners." What you want is a streamlined experience that shows the players how it feels to play the game.<br/><br/>If I were to demo Dogs in the Vineyard, here's how I might do it. <br/><br/>"Okay, you're a teenager, a virgin, and your community must have thought you were hot stuff, because they sent you off to Bridal Falls for some special training -- a whole eight weeks of it -- and then they gave you a kickass coat *show picture*, a horse, and -- most importantly -- a gun."<br/><br/>Then I'd write "kickass coat 1d8," "Slim, my horse 1d6," "huge revolver pistol 1d10+1d4" on a piece of paper. <br/>I'd put down a d8 in front of them: "That's your coat." <br/>I'd put down a d6 in front of them. "That's your horse." <br/>I'd put down a d10 and a d4 in front of them. "That's your big-ass gun. Imagine yourself at 15 years old. With a gun. Imagine if your town sent you off for special training and told you that you were invested with the authority of GOD to pass down judgment on sinners. With a gun, if necessary." Shudder.<br/><br/>Next, I'd take a fistful of d6es and give them to the player. "This is what you roll when you are talking." Add 8 more d6es. "And more if you try to kill someone."<br/><br/>"Okay, you're one of the Dogs, the judges of sinners. You're in this Town with some other Dogs. A woman runs up to you and says that Ebediah has a gun pointed at her daughter, Patience. Of course, you rush to help, and you find out that Ebediah is her 6 year-old son. He looks angry. He looks like he's gonna shoot little Patience right in the effing head. What do you do? Talk or shoot?"<br/><br/>Then walk them through a quick conflict. Don't get too detailed. Hand-hold them through the dice stuff or even make decisions for them about dice. This is a demo. Let them make cool in-character decisions. When you push two dice forward for their Raise, ask them to narrate it. Just handle the dice for them.<br/><br/>That's probably 15 minutes right there. Even if you stop in the middle of the conflict, they get it. In fact, they're hungry for more. Your demo can stop in the middle of exciting stuff and that can work in your favor. Want to find out what happens? Buy the goddamned game and play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221653/#Comment_221653" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T10:45:26+00:00" title="July 30, 2009 10:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Billy Mays here, for Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>lol                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221660/#Comment_221660" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T11:25:13+00:00" title="July 30, 2009 11:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me go further. I am working on a really weird game, Verge. Weird because it breaks some expectations, like character sheets. Here's how I might demo it.<br/><br/>I put down a giant piece of paper, totally blank. "This is the world. Pretty boring. Let's make it interesting. Verge is a dark and schizophrenic science-fiction game, sorta cyberpunky. Name a technology or two that should be in our world. Make it cool or weird or scary."<br/><br/>The player names something, maybe "mind cloning." I write "mind cloning!!!" on the paper. "The exclamation points mean that I think the idea is really cool. Every exclamation point will become a d6 later on. Okay, here's my idea." I write "zombie brainframe!" <br/><br/>"See, they harvest the brains out of cadavers and hook them up to this vast computer network and use the incredible processing power... well you get the point. How cool is that? Does it deserve some more exclamation points?" If so, I let them add a few. Note that the rules don't work exactly this way, but who cares.<br/><br/>"Alright. These things are connected." I draw a line between the two words on the paper. "Let's say that the brainframe <span style="text-decoration: underline;">enables</span> the mind cloning technology." I write "enables!" on the line and add an arrow tip to the line near the brainframe.<br/><br/>"Okay, so there's this dude, Ravi Kalpathy--" I write the name on the paper somewhere. "He invented the mind cloning technology." I connect the two phrases, add an arrow cap, write "invented" on the line. <br/><br/>"Who else?" The player gives me a name, say "Melissa Beers." I write it. <br/><br/>"How is she connected to the world?" I let the player draw a line from Melissa to one of the other nodes on the setting map and label it and stuff. Say Melissa hates the brainframe as an abomination and wants to destroy it. <br/><br/>"These things are cool." I add !!!! to them to show they're cool and that they get lots of dice.<br/><br/><br/>I have used up about half my time. That's okay, because setting creation is a big part of Verge play and it's hella fun. But I want to show them conflicts.<br/><br/>"Do you want to be Melissa or Ravi?" Say the player chooses Melissa. "I am the GM. I control Ravi and everything else, unless you win control over something."<br/><br/>"So Melissa sneaks into one of the brainframe facilities. She's got a briefcase that contains a sort of weird software virus that will make a brainframe brain go psychotic. She can totally screw up the entire computer network this way. Ravi sees a blip on the monitor built into his glasses. Does Ravi want to stop her or help?"<br/><br/>Then we do a quick conflict. I bring out some handfuls of d6es and show how the !'s become dice. In the end, maybe the brainframe is crashed. Maybe it's not. We had fun finding out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
