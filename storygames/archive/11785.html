We revisit the topic of beliefs. Specifically, we talk about why fewer beliefs have been resolved in recent sessions. We take another look at the firefight system and share some frustrations we have had with it.

When someone hands me a simple rule that will allow lots of permutations for storytelling, I always go, "AH-HA!"  <br><br>One complication of compromises is that they can spin out of control in a gazillion ways -- with everyone discussing them with their own eyes on what makes sense. The notion that you'd have compromises that are "realistic" outcomes an especially big trap, sine then you're playing that strange game of five people bringing in more and more detail to a fictional event that never happened but are trying to prove their case as to what would really happen.<br><br>To keep the compromise element focused on Beliefs means all one has to do is say, "Okay, what's on the PC's character sheet?" <br><br>I did this a couple of times in the session we played after the recording of the podcast. We'd finish a conflict with a compromise, Jesse's eyes would do that thing that says, "Oh, man, compromises, how are we going to do this?" and I'd ask, "What are the PC's Beliefs?" and wham-o, the notion that the compromise would be found in the limited orbit of the Belief made finding an inspired compromise inspired and quick.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263439/#Comment_263439" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T11:55:53+00:00" title="March 22, 2010 11:55AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2010 11:56AM by Jesse.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The issue for me is that I understand the GM's mandate of "Challenge the PC's Beliefs" but I didn't (don't) have a firm grasp of how to do that with the tool-set provided in Burning Empires.  Most of the games I play these days Dogs in the Vineyard, Sorcerer, Primetime Adventures, etc work purely on character-to-character confrontation.  Basically those games consist ONLY of Duels of Wits and Firefights, so to speak.  So the way I challenge a character in those games is I have an major NPC get in their face about it.  And we do that over and over from scene to scene.<br><br>But because the GM only gets one (optional two) conflicts per Maneuver that read to me like I only get to challenge one Belief a maneuver.  Which I knew HAD to be wrong.  The Building Scene is the weird unfamiliar tool in the box because it rarely deals with direct confrontations between Major Characters.  And I could never figure out how as the GM I was supposed to challenge a PC's Beliefs with Building Scenes, largely because the GM has almost no say in the content of PC's own Builder.  But then I realized that isn't true.  I get to set the failure condition.  That's why I called it "Back Door GMing"  I'm not throwing something AT the player as a confrontation but I AM attaching a price tag to it.<br><br>That's weird and unfamiliar.  Interesting outcomes are dirt simple from a direct confrontation because either Character A or Character B gets their way (or some compromise there of) and the story moves forward.  But making a "Finance" roll interesting from a Belief standpoint is really, really hard.<br/><br/>The issues are even more complicated when using GM Building scenes because I could never figure out what should be a builder vs. what I could get away with in a Color scene.  That's because I would find myself in this awkward situation of wanting to do something that would probably be a Building Scene but if I rolled for it and failed it meant that the players didn't get challenged.  It felt like I had to roll to introduce a Bang.<br/><br/>For example, in Sorcerer I would just say, "You try to use your credit card and it's declined.  You check your financial records and they've been ruined."  That's a bang.  No roll needed.  But in BE that's VERY OBVIOUSLY a Building Roll very likely Finances or maybe even Security first linked into Finances.  But, if I fail those rolls what happens?  It's hard enough making Failure of those rolls interesting for the PCs but what the hell does Failure on those rolls for an NPC mean other than, "Oh you don't get to have this cool Bang."?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263470/#Comment_263470" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T13:33:01+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  1:33PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have direct experience with BE but from BW play, I wouldn't apply the same belief driven rules about failure conditions to NPCs. The tension there is found in anticipating the consequences of NPC success. Failure is a repreave.<br/><br/>For PC failure conditions, hitting beliefs works well. Especially "yes, and/but" failure conditions like "if you fail, you get what you want but this other thing happens." Not sure about BE, but I expect that other thing can challenge another PC's beliefs as easily as it could challenge the one making the test.

Given my GMing style there should never be any repreave through NPC failure alone.  As a consequence of PC action, yes, as a consequence of an NPC doing something over here ---&gt; and they rolled badly, no.  That just feels like me rolling to earn my ability to GM.<br/><br/>Now, if I think about NPC FON's as "just another character" in the wider story, okay, yes.  I think that's what I may need to do if I run BE in the future.  But my brain is more PC focused than that.  In fact, I was thinking about it.  IF I were to rewrite a rule in BE it would be how GM FON's earn Artha.<br/><br/>I'd change it to this: NPC FON's don't have Beliefs.  Instead they earn Fate when they take action that successfully antagonizes a PC's Belief.  They earn Persona if the PC rewrites the Belief as a direct consequence of the NPC's actions.<br/><br/>Now, to be clear, I say that only to illustrate where my head is.  I doubt I'd ever really do that or play that way.<br/><br/>So you can see why Building Scenes were so hard for me.  I don't care about my FON's Beliefs.  I only care about how their actions activate the PC's Beliefs.  And rolling to achieve something that is going to activate a PC's Belief which is the entire social mandate of the GM felt awkward.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263504/#Comment_263504" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T15:34:29+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  3:34PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, this is good stuff (in the thread.

Which means we get to see their reaction.  So even if I fail, it's still a big deal in the fiction.<br><br>The problem I had was for Building Scenes that were attacks on PCs but required no response or reaction from the PCs unless the Building Scene succeeded.  Failure usually render the whole thing a non-event.  For example let's say I'm trying to financially ruin a PC.  A direct attack correct.  But I'm rolling Security and Finances.  The player is obviously aware of this because they're sitting right there.  But the character likely isn't because this is some fiscal hacker dude working at a terminal.  So I roll and fail.  <br><br>The whole point was to see what the PC would do if their finances were ruined.  But I failed.  So it's rendered a non-event.  At no point does the PC ever have to "jump" in response because it's not allowed to develop to the point where it would require their attention.  It might as well not have happened at all.<br><br>And since you're usually curious about this sort of thing, no this situation didn't happen in our game.  However, what did happen was that I didn't do very many Building Scenes because of this phenomenon.  I felt paralyzed by building scenes.  I didn't want to even attempt them because of the risk of having them simply go no where.<br><br>Also, I'm willing to accept that this is a failure on my part to understand how to use a Building Scene.  Which is why I keep saying in the podcast: I thinking Building Scenes are key to making this game work.<br><br>Jesse<br><br/>P.S. Or even consider your own example.  If the Observation/Security part fails, nothing that requires the PCs attention happens.  They have failed to be located.  Which is really my question.  When an NPC fails a Building Scene how do you engineer the result so that the PC still has to respond in some fashion.  Other than to sit back and grin and go, "Well, glad that didn't pan out for you."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263746/#Comment_263746" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T15:17:50+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  3:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, you need to realize that every single piece of fiction you author is a weapon.<br/><br/>In the example of the valkyrie squad Belief: It's a colour scene for your NPC to band women from the sodalis or whatever.

There is none unless the players want it, and that requires them to take initiative against it. If your character is the head of the church, he can say whatever you want him to say, and everybody will go along with it unless the players challenge it <i>in the game</i>. if you want your character to have an orbital death ray, you can have one anytime you want, with a colour scene.

They can destroy it, which is easy if you don't back it up by rolling for it, but they can't <i>make</i> you roll for it.

They had placed my High Inquisitor under House Arrest.  I wanted him moved to the temple where he would have greater access and mobility to allies.  So I used a Building Scene.  I rolled Church Law with the intent of "citing" a law that allows members of the church to be held in sanctuary at the temple.  I linked that into a Bureaucracy roll with the intent of slipping orders for prisoner transfer past Celeste so that the High Inquisitor would be transferred before she discovered the order.<br/><br/>Now if I'd started that out as simply a Color scene, "Archcotar Mallog issues orders for a prisoner transfer of Morikean to the Temple under right of sanctuary."  And Celeste says, "Like hell he does that stuff has to go through my channels!"  Whose Building Scene is it?  Mine or Hers?

If so, they will get to make a roll against you if you try to do anything about it.<br/><br/>So, here's some options:<br/><br/>1. Move your guy wherever you want. Players don't like it? Fuck 'em. Bring it. Your guy controls an army right? Colour scene.<br/><br/>2. Issue a fatwa that says Church dudes can choose which house. How much leverage this actually nets you depends on the fiction you have already set up. If you have already established the church can't do this, then players are well within their rights to denounce the fatwa with a colour scene and mobilize the church against you. Still, this is also a colour scene.<br/><br/>3. If you want to actually challenge the legal claim (and presumably you would do this because the PCs and the government in your game would follow the law), then yeah, it's a building scene and you need to make a roll. A player who argues against you gets their half of the Versus test free, just like if you attacked them.<br/><br/>4. If they have you under guard, however, and you try to move your dude(s), then you also need to make a roll against them, and their part of that Versus test is free.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So I used a Building Scene.  I rolled Church Law with the intent of "citing" a law that allows members of the church to be held in sanctuary at the temple.  I linked that into a Bureaucracy roll with the intent of slipping orders for prisoner transfer past Celeste so that the High Inquisitor would be transferred before she discovered the order.</blockquote>\nSo you picked option 3. When you say you linked it, does that mean your Church Law test was successful? And your guy can, with the full weight of the law, move to sanctuary at the temple? (Rules point: Determining legality, Ob 2, yes?) In which case, why do you need to slip the transfer order past Celeste? What will she do about it if she finds out?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Now if I'd started that out as simply a Color scene, "Archcotar Mallog issues orders for a prisoner transfer of Morikean to the Temple under right of sanctuary."  And Celeste says, "Like hell he does that stuff has to go through my channels!"  Whose Building Scene is it?  Mine or Hers?  It strikes me that it's still mine, otherwise Building Scenes become re-active rather than pro-active.</blockquote>\nOkay, depends on how you do it. Your colour scene has you issuing a transfer order. Okay, done. Did you previously establish that Celeste controls the archcotare's communications? Yes/No.<br/><br/>Yes, she has control over his communications: In this case, you are correct. You need to use up one of your building tests to get your communications out without her finding out. If you don't care if she finds out, you got a colour scene, and if she wants to do something about it, like block your communication, she spends a colour scene (and the next time she fails a Circles roll, somebody who saw her do that rats her out and defects to your side). If you decide to go for the test, her side of the Versus test is free for her.<br/><br/>No, she does not control the archcotare's communications: Sucks for her. Your dude can call up whoever he wants, so he issues the transfer order in your colour scene. Done and done. If Celeste wants to do something about it, she will either need to have a previously established reason in the fiction that she would be able to know or to block it somehow, or she will have to spend building tests. Of course, she could just use a colour scene to have Celeste notice the archcotare being transferred. But then she still has to spend her own scenes to stop it.<br/><br/>Does that help? I don't know if I covered the details you actually had in your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263814/#Comment_263814" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T20:51:06+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  8:51PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone is preaching gospel here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to offer a response to Jesse's assertion that a failed Observation/Security roll goes no where in my example.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure is a result that must be colored like any other.

Failing does not make this a non-issue for you, unless the GM nerfs the consequences with a "nothing happens." Instead, how about this for failure result: "When the PC goes to use their credit card and it's declined. A call to the bank shows that someone has stolen their identity and messed with their finances. They're issuing a new card and put a fraud alert out." Now you've got PCs who can react to the attack. Perhaps they have some skills (security) or connections (circles) that can trace the attempts back to their source.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263833/#Comment_263833" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T23:22:09+00:00" title="March 23, 2010 11:22PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, just to go back to the kidnapping example: You had an NPC try to kidnap a PC relationship, right?
