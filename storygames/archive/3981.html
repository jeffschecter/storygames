Having learned a few lessons from running Agon at Dexcon, I had a few tricks planned that would ensure Decator was a tough fight.  Decator was built with 16 strife, the highest amount possible for the heroes.  Decator had the multiple attacks and \xe2\u20ac\u02dcnatural weapons\xe2\u20ac\u2122 special abilities, meaning he could use different weapons to attack separate targets in the same round.  Decator had the best armor possible!  The battle commenced according to expectations\xe2\u20ac\u201da battle of attrition, as the heroes and Decator wore down each others armor and inflicted minor wounds.  Then, it happened:  the hero Polyctis struck with a spear and rolled 8 damage.  He called on divine favor to \xe2\u20ac\u02dcexplode\xe2\u20ac\u2122 the die.  He rolled again, another 8.  He rolled again, another 8!  He rolled again, 1.  Polyctis adds +1 to the damage for being a monster slayer.  Decator\xe2\u20ac\u2122s defense roll is 6, and his armor has been worn away.  The end result is 6 victories for Polyctis\xe2\u20ac\u2122 attack\xe2\u20ac\u201dby itself enough to eliminate the monster (even had he not already had one wound)!  This was a great moment\xe2\u20ac\u201dthe player spent resources provided in the game mechanics to take a gamble and wins big!  The best part is that the character concept was as a \xe2\u20ac\u02dcmonster-slayer\xe2\u20ac\u2122\xe2\u20ac\u201dand he did!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89129/#Comment_89129" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T10:48:30+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 10:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glorious.<br/><br/>That resources + gambling thing is exactly what Agon play is all about.<br/><br/>Rules nitpick: The fact that he already had one wound wouldn't have mattered. Six victories marks his '6' box (defeated), and leaves the other boxes unmarked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
