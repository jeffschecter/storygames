Aside from the goal to have a buttload of fun, the purposes for this campaign are two: to give the Verses RPG rules a working progression towards completion through extended playtest, and to work as a unit to create a new campaign setting in which all involved can be personally invested. So far, after a character and setting jam session and one actual play session, the results are better than satisfactory. With this post, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll kick off a series of post-session Actual Play reports.<br/><br/><a href="http://blog.realitymerchants.com/articles/2007/07/26/undiscovered-countries-session-001-post-game-report/" rel="nofollow">Here's a link to the full report</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83446/#Comment_83446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T09:40:22+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  9:40AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was the coolest part of the game?

We used to run this LARP, see... but that's another story.<br/><br/>For me, I think the coolest part of the game session was the 12%/15%/17% deal.  The tone set down with that moment really set the feel for the four hours of gameplay that followed.  it's been a long time since I've seen players do that so quickly, effectively, and possibly even unconsciously.<br/><br/>My least-enjoyed moment at the time would be the end.  I was sad to see the session conclude.  In hindsight, I wish I had given more opportunities for one or two of the players to shine a little more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
