So after everyone advised me on how to make a Call of Cthulhu adventure I gave it a shot. We had our first session and while we didn't finish up nobody was bored enough to request I never run it again, so we'll probably give it a shot.<br/><br/>The way I prepped is that I started with a monster, and then used Graham's advice of coming up with a bunch of different scenes where the players Find Stuff out. While the game ended up not playing out like this at all, it gave me a good starting point. I came up with a bunch of scenes and some information to go along with it.<br/><br/>We did character creation and got a detective, a doctor, a journalist, and an actor. We didn't exactly have an "adventuring party" and instead of forcing everyone to know each other and be friends I decided to rope everyone in by connecting them to the larger plot and making it more intimate. I basically took those scenes I created using Graham's advice and created an R-map with the NPCs and the characters. <br/><br/>There were some fun scenes like the doctor trying to keep his colleague from hanging himself and the actor trying to cover up for his sister's attempt to drown her child. And there was some not so fun stuff. Mainly the characters running around in circles and the players seemingly doing everything in their power to keep from teaming up ("It's not what my character would do"). I was trying to pass clues out that they could then get together on, but that didn't work out. The actor is avoiding everyone because of his sister's scandalous situation and the police detective is a dick. I had a post-game chat about it though, where I was like, "Guys, I am foreseeing the climax of this game only having one or two characters in it while everyone else sits out," so they are being more mindful of it for next game.<br/><br/>I am already having to modify some things about the scenario, based on the way people are going with their characters. The journalist in particular is being left out (nobody wants to talk to the press) so I'm giving her some spotlight next game. Some mysterious stranger left her a letter arranging a meeting time in a dark alley.<br/><br/>It's enjoyable though. I think next session if I crank up the heat on what's happening things will pick up. If people want to continue after this I might have them convert their characters to Trail of Cthulhu though. Right now the rules are pretty opaque, we struggle to determine what skills cover what, and I'm afraid to call for skill rolls because the characters fail <i>all the time</i>.<br/><br/>But man, Lovecraft made a setting ripe for roleplaying games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220915/#Comment_220915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T07:23:56+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  7:23AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2009 8:00AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://mrparallel.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/there-is-no-god/" rel="nofollow">If you need non-tentacled inspiration</a>.

It kills the mood to be like, "Let's team up, grab some guns, and kick some ass!" unless you're specifically going for the Evil Dead/They Live style. And my players in this game really want to play mystery/horror Call of Cthulhu, so only one of them actually has a handgun.<br/><br/>So in this game I'm using my tried-and-true, perfect GMing technique: "Come on, guys!" And like I said I spoke with them a bit after the game and they're going to stay aware of it for next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
