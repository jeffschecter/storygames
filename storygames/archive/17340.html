It was a mission called <a href="http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/operation-resplendent-crane/" rel="nofollow">Operation Resplendent Crane</a> run expertly by Carl Rigney. I instantly fell in love with the game and bought the book with plans to run a game of it myself.<br/><br/>As is my habit, I couldn't stop thinking of the game and ideas spilled forth from my head about the world of the Blue City. In order to go about my life, I had to get them out of my head and write them all down. And so I present to any who care to read\u2026<br/><br/><b>Lacuna - Outskirts of Blue City (a fan made supplement)</b> <br/>Most Blue Agent missions occur in the bustling center of Blue City. While districts often move and shift, they are always there somewhere if you look hard enough. The Landmark buildings such as the Hotel and the Cafe often look a bit different every time but they are always unmistakably them. However, if you take the the express tram you might just find yourself far away from City proper in the Outskirts where things are different, more confusing, and more dangerous \u2014 it is in the Outskirts where the deep blue cracks begin to show.<br/><br/><b>Contains:</b><br/> - Notes on navigating the Outskirts. <i>Finding your way there is sometimes easier than finding your way back.</i><br/> - Brief yet rich descriptions of Landmark named areas in the Outskirts of Blue City to help spawn ideas for missions.<br/> - Lacuna Outskirts Revised Rules (optional; see below)<br/> - Deep Blue Clearance Info on the conscious awareness of Personalities in Blue City and new Restricted Techniques for Senior Agents.<br/> - Black Clearance Info on dealing with high levels of Private Static, and the rumored special talents that Spidermen, HPs, and Rogue Agents may or may not have.<br/><br/>The <b>Lacuna Outskirts Revised Rules</b> are basically my formalized house rules that iron out some of the wrinkles I didn't like in the main (second attempt) rules. The biggest revision is to the Commendation Point system which I found really clunky. Also, tweaks Private Static a bit which along with the new Restricted Techniques makes Deep Blue Senior Agents more interesting to play as PCs as they are slightly less prone to spiraling into Black Agent madness. It also contains <i>AW-like</i> GM Agendas, Principals, and Moves as I find those to be a great help in running any game.<br/><br/>You can access the Google Doc here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11kVqyv5ql-mhqpykL68w78zKodtqxzy61qmBx-1bs4Q/edit" rel="nofollow">Lacuna - Outskirts of Blue City</a>.<br/>And my revised rules Agent Sheet is here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_x5XNahtqzvdjRMdFdjNDVSLU0/edit" rel="nofollow">Lacuna - Outskirts Revised Agent Sheet</a> [pdf]<br/><br/>I've also fleshed out a mission to run that involves the Outskirts, but I'm not posting it until I run it and work out the kinks.<br/><br/>So there you go, feel free to use/abuse/remix the ideas however you want.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392950/#Comment_392950" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T21:01:34+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  9:01PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coolness, that goes to the top of my lunch-time reading queue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393123/#Comment_393123" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T11:32:20+00:00" title="October 11, 2012 11:32AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Zircher, glad I could offer you some enjoyment during your lunch hour!

It's actually why I came up with the extra Senior Agent talents to make it a bit more friendly towards advancement if people want to run multiple games. Obviously not everyone is interested in character advancement in their games. <br/><br/>Even if you only run one shots it offers some ideas for scenerios where Blue Agents stumble in over their heads. One of the 20+ Static examples is meeting a Black Agent or Rogue Agent so I figure the extra techniques gives some idea fodder for how these NPCs would be more "reality bending" than your normal Agent. Also, dropping hints about even weirder areas is fun even if the Agents never encounter it \u2014 <br/>Senior Agent Baker: "Just be thankful your not locked up at the Prison."  <br/>Agent Taylor: "What's the Prison?" <br/>Senior Agent Baker: "You don't want to know kid"<br/><br/>P.S. thanks I caught that error and fixed the sheet                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398041/#Comment_398041" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T22:40:35+00:00" title="November 18, 2012 10:40PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got a chance to run my mission I called "Into the Lino's Den" that partially involved the Zoo and used my revised rules. It went really well! While None of the new Deep Blue (Senior Agent techniques) or Black material was used the revised rules for Heart Rate and Commendation Points were great. I ended up making a few modifications. The changes are reflected in the Google Doc and they are as follows:<br/><br/>- Starting Agent Points per mission is now equal to Career Points (it was previously Career Points + Mission Points but I realized that was way too much).<br/>- If the Agent has the Technique Achievement they begin with +2AP.<br/>- If the Agent has the Technique Meditation, they can spend 1AP to lower Current Heart Rate by 5 BPM.<br/>- For every 5 additional point of success the success may have additional side benefits for the Agent or scene: 11 is a normal success, 16 is a great success, 21 is an amazing success, 26 is a mindblowing success, etc.<br/>- I also added a new section on "Game Master advice on running a mystery in Blue City"<br/><br/>If anyone ends up using my revised rules and has comments please feel free to send them my way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398156/#Comment_398156" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T23:50:40+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 11:50PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Into The Lion's Den</b><br/>This mission is designed specifically as an game for 3-4 players who are new to Lacuna as it begins with the Agents not knowing what is happening, where they are, or who they are. Stumbling and confusion and a suspicious reliance on Control is part of the story so the less players know about Lacuna and the Blue City the better. That said, it can likely easily be adapted for players who know Lacuna as there are some deeper mystery threads to tap.<br/><br/><b><i>Don't follow the link if you think you may play this mission as an Agent!
