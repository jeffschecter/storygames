So now I pose some ideas to the collective...<br/><br/><b>Players Roll All the Dice</b><br/>I generally like this approach as I've found it keeps engagement up, especially in classic games like D&amp;D where the active player can plot and roll and the others at the table tune out. My thoughts about handling this in Whitehack follow the "Roll High Under" mechanic:<br/><br/><i>Generally: Success = Roll over quality; roll under skill/attribute; crit on skill/attribute; fumble on 20</i>\n<ul><li>PC Attack: Success = Roll over enemy AC, roll under AV; crit on AV; fumble on 20</li><li>PC Defense: Success = Roll over enemy hit dice, roll under Ascending Armour Class (or 10 + AC); critical defense on AAC; critical hit against PC on 20</li><li>PC save/task: Success = Roll over "quality" or challenge set by the GM, roll under save or attribute; enemy fumble on ST or attribute; PC fumble on 20</li><li>Enemy save/task (or, effectiveness of PC magic): Success = Roll over enemy HD, roll under attribute; enemy fumble on attribute; PC fumble on 20</li></ul>\n<b>Degrees of Success</b><br/>Preserving the "Roll High Under" mechanic, I am now thinking about pulling in degrees of success and soft/hard moves from DW. The idea here is that rolling too low (e.g., attack roll below enemy AC) means that the PC does not overcome that quality - it is a <i>partial success</i> or even <i>success with a cost</i> (if you prefer FATE terms). Similarly, rolling too high (e.g., attack roll is beyond the PC's attack value) suggests a significant failure.<br/><br/>So then... partial success may evoke soft moves and failure may evoke hard moves.<br/><br/>For example, an enemy charges and PC defends. On a partial success, perhaps the PC takes no damage but is pushed back (with or without damage?). But if it were a failure there would definitely be damage involved. Alternately, casting a spell against a skeleton (1HD) would likely be successful, but a partial success could mean minimal effect on the enemy or full effect but the PC is unable to cast for a short time. Failure in this instance could mean the spell backfires or corruption occurs.<br/><br/>Still playing with this. Trying to mash together my new-found loves of Whitehack and DW with my first love of D&amp;D (AD&amp;D 2e, that is).<br/><br/>=====<br/>EDIT<br/>=====<br/><a href="http://esix.pbworks.com/f/RaisingtheStakes.pdf" rel="nofollow">Raising the Stakes</a> - d20 source for "Players Roll all the Dice"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445075/#Comment_445075" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-02T22:28:22+00:00" title="May  2, 2015 10:28PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>Degrees of Success</b><br/>Preserving the "Roll High Under" mechanic, I am now thinking about pulling in degrees of success and soft/hard moves from DW.

It's very tricky to get it to work.<br/><br/>For example, the way you have it set up, enemy strength and/or difficulty numbers don't actually affect your chances of failure. (They just affect what portion of you successes are full successes, versus partial successes.)<br/><br/>If that's what you want, you're OK. But it might not be. (For instance, fights between high-level characters and high-level monsters will basically only ever be partial successes, with rare failures, and - depending on how you set it up - no full successes.)<br/><br/>Think carefully and check corner cases before setting this in stone...<br/><br/>Also take a look at an earlier thread of mine: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19408/a-rather-odd-confluence-of-d-d-and-apocalypse-world-or-a-die-mechanic-late-night-absurdium" rel="nofollow">Odd Confluence</a>.

I've been following your thread but am not ready to make even more wholesale changes to a system that I haven't even played yet. The simple resolution for me, then, is to allow <b>success at a cost</b> when players roll exactly the quality of the challenge (e.g. Rolling a monter's AC during combat). This will also serve to achieve a degree of symmetry with critical hits as well as preserving the author's idea that the roll demonstrates the quality of the success. <br/><br/>Really, I'm trying to introduce non-binary yes/sorta/no resolution to a group of casual players who've only ever played D&amp;D...

Rolls that are too low or too high are failures; a natural 20 is a fumble.<br/><br/>For standard combat (PC attacking enemy), the low threshold to beat is Armour Class or AC - which generally ranges +0 to +6 - and the high threshold is the character's "Attack Value" or AV - which generally starts at 10/11 and increases as characters advance. In this instance, it would be extremely unlikely for AC &gt; AV. For such an instance I would love to see the resolution be "critical hit with a cost" providing interesting opportunities for the fiction.<br/><br/>For my hack of PC defense (player rolls against enemy attack), the low threshold would be monster Hit Dice which could typically range 1-10HD while the high threshold would be "Ascending Armour Class", alternately 10 + the PC's AC. Again, unlikely but possible that HD &gt; AAC with the potential for a similar complicated resolution.<br/><br/>Going back to <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T%27s">@Paul_T's</a> suggestion:\n<blockquote>So, if your ability is 11, and your enemy's is 8:<br/><br/>1-8 Failure<br/>9-11 Full success<br/>12-19 Partial success<br/>20 Critical success<br/><br/>Those are pretty AW/DW-like odds.</blockquote>\nI could picture this, but I would put the Critical Success on a roll of 11 and Fumble on a natural 20, to preserve the Whitehack mechanic.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445092/#Comment_445092" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-04T17:30:55+00:00" title="May  4, 2015  5:30PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

First edition had three separate systems. In first edition, combat and save were roll-over and task was roll-high-under. In combat, rolling 20 was a crit, but in tasks it was a fumble; certainly confusing at the table. In second edition, rolling a 20 is always a fumble and rolling exactly your value is a critical success in all three cases.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/allinonemove">@allinonemove</a>, does it bother you to change the number of successful outcomes in a roll?

If they roll equal or less than their AC they know right away it's a miss. If the roll is 10 or less, but above AC, it's hit. Otherwise the player says the number rolled ("12!") and he GM says if it's a hit or not based on monster HD (attack value is 10+HD). This doesn't require any house rules, it simply shifts the roll from the GM to the player, but AC is still an active component of the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/allinonemove" title="allinonemove"><img alt="allinonemove" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/allinonemove">allinonemove</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445244/#Comment_445244" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-15T20:22:17+00:00" title="May 15, 2015  8:22PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2015 8:25PM by allinonemove.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/allinonemove">@allinonemove</a>, does it bother you to change the number of successful outcomes in a roll?

A straight Goblin attack under standard WH would be successful on rolls over Kalynna's AC7 and under their own AV11 which accounts for 4/20 = 20% of rolls.</li></ul>\nThe paradigm of "Players roll all the dice" really encourages heroism at the table - every action is about the players and their characters. Not only are the people sitting around the table constantly engaged by needing to make all the rolls, the characters are the focus of all decisions being made. This allows flexibility within the fiction - player attack / monster attack of D&amp;D etc really encourages taking turns whacking each other. From what I've seen and read, "Players roll all the dice" encourages more creativity - players now choose whether their character takes the blow or decides that their defense is actually some other action. This is really borrowing heavily from Dungeon World.<br/><br/>I suppose it's all about keeping the focus on the players and characters. I'm okay with letting them know monster HD and AC to allow them to keep rolling, stay in character, and having fun.<br/><br/>PS: Jonas - I've been enjoying all your Whitehack posts here and on other forums.

When I said 12+, I was referring to Paul_T's suggestion on degrees of success. Turning the failure part of the roll (12+) into a partial success would change the tone of the game a lot. If that's what you want it's fine, but that's why I asked about the probabilities. I haven't played Apocalypse or Dungeon World, so I don't know if more competent characters, or at least more favorable situations, are appropriate in those games. A partial success like a push back would change Whitehack, since that's usually a special combat option which you suddenly get for free.<br/><br/>I like the idea in the first post on treating partial successes as a decision point for the player: take a chance to make at least something good happen now, but risk something really bad happen now or later. The second edition introduced saves to work magic in some situations, so it would be appropriate to use saves in other situations as well; for example a successful save at a partial success pushes the monster back, but a failed save makes the PC lose their actions the next round or two. The player would get to choose if they want to risk it or not, and the partial success description wouldn't need to be hard coded, but could be improvised by the referee and player for each situation.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear about the other planned hacks you mentioned above. Do you know that second edition introduced a slot system for equipment in the troubleshooting section on page 60? We still use my slot hack, because I like that the equipment slots are divided between body (5 slots), backpack (5 slots), and sack (5 slots). If the PC lose their backpack or sack, either intentionally to flee faster or unintentionally, it's easy to know which items where lost. With second edition I'm tempted to remove our house rules for parts where the rules have changed between editions, because I want to try the rules as written before modifying them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/allinonemove" title="allinonemove"><img alt="allinonemove" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/allinonemove">allinonemove</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445257/#Comment_445257" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-17T14:11:54+00:00" title="May 17, 2015  2:11PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Encumbrance</b><br/>Inspired by LOTFP and another Whitehack-er (don't recall at the moment), encumbrance is based on slots and not much different than that proposed in "Troubleshooting" of the second edition. <br/><br/>Each item carried fills a slot(s); heavier items may fill two slots while up to 200 small or insubstantial items (e.g., coins) may fill a single slot. There are a total of 25 slots, filling them with gear will reduce movement. Note that weapons and armour are not included in calculating encumbrance.<br/><br/>The first 5 equipment slots are "free"; carrying 0-5 pieces of gear has no effect on movement. Exceptional strength adds additional free slots based on strength bonus. Additional gear reduces movement by one category for every 5 slots filled. So, 6-10 items reduces by one category, 11-15 by two, 15-20 by three, and 21-25 by four, and 26-30 by five. <br/><br/>Armour reduces maximum movement based on type. Light armour (e.g. Cloth, leather) has no effect on movement, medium armour (e.g., chainmail) reduces maximum movement by one category, and heavy armour (e.g., Plate) reduces maximum movement by two categories. For example, a human/elf wearing chainmail would have the following movement rates based on slots filled: 0-5 slots = MV 9*, 6-10 slots = MV 9, 11-15 slots = MV 6, 16-20 slots = MV 3, and 21-25 slots  = MV 0. A similarly armoured dwarf would progress 6/6/6/3/0. <br/><br/>All of this is handled with a simple numbered table or set of lines on the character sheet. <br/><br/>I do like the suggestion of location based slots (e.g., pack), but have another idea for that to post shortly. It's another port over from Dungeon World.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/allinonemove" title="allinonemove"><img alt="allinonemove" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/allinonemove">allinonemove</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445258/#Comment_445258" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-17T15:18:57+00:00" title="May 17, 2015  3:18PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2015 3:19PM by allinonemove.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Success at a Cost</b><br/>As I mentioned before, I'd like to add a bit of this FATE/DW mechanic into the game. Without breaking the roll probabilities, I'm now thinking that success at a cost is a compliment to critical hits. <br/><br/>When the players roll equal to the value of the low threshold (e.g. Enemy AC when attacking, difficulty of trap, etc.), they can be presented with a choice. Straight out failure, as per Whitehack, or success that has some risk or other detriment. Maybe it's as simple as overspending ammo on a ranged attack, an AC or attack penalty, or taking damage after successfully jumping across a deep chasm. Or maybe it's an interpersonal or environmental effect that's appropriate for the situation.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445264/#Comment_445264" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-18T00:29:16+00:00" title="May 18, 2015 12:29AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2015 12:42AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like fun, but kind of the opposite of the spirit of e.g. Dungeon World. (Where "success at a cost" is designed into the system as the MOST common outcome, rather than a rare event.)<br/><br/>I don't know Whitehack but my suggestion was to use a D&amp;D-ish d20 roll as I described above:\n<blockquote><br/>* The basic difficulty or your opposition's ability is the number you must beat in order not to fail.<br/><br/>* However, if you go over your skill level, it's only a partial success.<br/></blockquote>\n<br/>For this to work like Dungeon World, you'd need a range roughly as follows:<br/><br/>Enemy/difficulty Numbers (e.g. AC) from 2-12. (Typical number about 6-8.)<br/><br/>Ability scores (for PCs) from 9 or 10 to 13 or 14. (Typically about 11-12.)<br/><br/>Dungeon World PCs are quite competent, of course. You can tone this down for more of a "old-school" feel.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that in Dungeon World, failure is never overwhelmingly likely. At least partial success is always possible. Similarly, in this system the worst odds you'd ever have (against an enemy or difficult of 12) is still about 40% of success.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the best way to do this would be to give PCs *higher* Ability scores, since that would create a larger range for possible enemy Numbers/difficulty numbers.<br/><br/>(Of course, you can match Dungeon World more precisely if you use two rolls...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bizarrojoe" title="bizarrojoe"><img alt="bizarrojoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bizarrojoe">bizarrojoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445345/#Comment_445345" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-26T11:43:35+00:00" title="May 26, 2015 11:43AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have there been any playtests of these new rules with a group?
