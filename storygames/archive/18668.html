Here a draft of the complete rules. They will fit on 5 playing cards. <br/><br/>The game uses a deck of action cards, four scene cards, location and character cards, so there is a little bit of a board and figures without all the fuss of miniatures and terrain.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Impressions? Problems?<br/><br/>1<br/>Color text to get them in the mood.<br/>Are you ready to tell a story? Here is how you play.<br/><br/>2<br/>Players pick a character to play. [The players make up info on their characters that set up relationships between them. The type of relationships depends on the type of story being told. This will be different for different games.] EDIT: Players get five action cards. They draw back to five after playing a card.<br/><br/>3<br/>Each player runs a character but you get to say what everyone does in a scene, not just your guy. The host starts the game. They play an action card or pick up the first scene card and make up a story about what happens based on the card. <br/><br/>Example: CARD \u201cBetray\u201d STORY: Maria tells me to meet her behind the school. I show up on time but she\u2019s not there. Instead I meet her brother\u2019s gang and they jump me. Bitch!<br/><br/>4<br/>The other players get to add to or alter the story by playing a card and saying what else happens. After each addition the two players roll two six-sided dice each. The high roller wins. They get the other player\u2019s card (which gives them victory points). The winner may say that the other player\u2019s action didn\u2019t happen but unless they clearly say this, both actions happen. Each player gets one addition to the story a turn. If a challenger wins the roll then they roll the dice against the rest of the additions. Once everyone has had a chance to add, the turn ends. <br/><br/>5<br/>At the end of the turn the players may move characters to new locations to set up new scenes. You may move unplayed characters but if anyone disagrees on the move, roll 2d6, the high roller makes the move. <br/><br/>Player characters may not die until the last scene of the game. The game ends when the last scene is played. The players then get to make a final statement about what happens to their character as the story closes. The player with the fewest victory points goes first, the one with the most goes last.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419296/#Comment_419296" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T08:07:14+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  8:07AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2013 8:07AM by Veav.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The link to the draft is, ah, lightly foxed.
