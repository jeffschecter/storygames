The system really lends itself to manipulation in both style and subsystems, and I find that I have no shortage of creative ideas to write. However, lately I\u2019ve been growing concerned that in the pursuit of more intricate systems for playbooks and cooler character options, I\u2019m diverging too much from the core experience of DW. Some of what I\u2019ve created doesn\u2019t mesh well with the style of the game.<br/><br/>While a good class should by stylish and fun to play, front-loaded complexity slows the game down too much. My newer designs are intended to make something that is easy to pick up and play, yet offers both a distinct style and fun choices. A little extra complexity can be added in from advanced moves, along with specialization.<br/><br/>That said, here\u2019s my take on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrZTZ3dlVWeEl4Tjg/view" rel="nofollow">Warlock</a>. I found this class to have more in common with a bard rather than the wizard, although it can certainly evolve in that direction. I\u2019m hoping to strike a balance between easy to understand and fun/stylish to play. Different people will take different approaches to this idea, and I tried to give as many avenues to explore as possible. Comments and critiques are welcome, as always.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439550/#Comment_439550" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T16:15:14+00:00" title="October 17, 2014  4:15PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Morrius, <br/><br/>I thought I'd give you some feedback about the Warlock, and my thoughts on DW class design might emerge from that.<br/><br/>EVOCATION<br/>I think the attack move and the utility move should be split. Maybe that means that the Demonic Minion absorbs the utility parts of this move; maybe it warrants a discrete move. But something like adding the fiery tag to just one of half a dozen Evocation choices (the Infernal Patron) suggests to me that the move is trying to do too many things.<br/><br/>I also think one of the liberating things about DW not having - for example - concealment rules is that you don't need to limit yourself to filling an area with magical darkness. You could have a choice like: "Bring darkness down upon a person, place or thing". Now the one move lets you make people upset or corrupted, places dark - metaphorically or literally, and cloak things in shadow.<br/><br/>I also think you should ditch the final price (about getting a CHA penalty).<br/><br/>MISTER NICK<br/>This seems to suit a cleric much more than a warlock. What about, "made someone acknowledge the power of your patron"? This also puts a pressure on warlocks. Hide your patron and your power, and escape the witch hunters, or reveal them and get sweet XP?<br/><br/>DEMONIC MINION<br/>I think your minion has been short-changed in comparison to say the Fighter's signature weapon. What does your minion look like? What's its relationship with you? What's its relationship with the patron? These are all worth a list of options, I reckon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439563/#Comment_439563" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-20T00:15:11+00:00" title="October 20, 2014 12:15AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback.

I'm still trying to strike a balance between simple to pick up, fun to play, and reasonably well-balanced. It's not an easy task!<br/><br/>I had flirted with the idea of switching the central mechanic of the class to reflect Sage\u2019s Battlemind, but I decided to keep the Paths, since they added a lot of flavor and helped to give the class more unique style. I also wanted to draw more from Wuxia tropes to make the Monk more than just a bare-handed fighter, but instead someone who has his own niche in the world. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrOUZ6THFEaDlTMjQ/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> the latest revision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439858/#Comment_439858" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-03T01:39:26+00:00" title="November  3, 2014  1:39AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The paths are pretty cool \u2013 but I find all the focus around tic-tacking the unarmed strike a little unrewarding and complex.

Could you clarify what you said?<br/><br/>Wire Fu accomplishes a similar function as Bend Bars, Lift Gates, in that it allows you to push the envelope of what you can accomplish with dexterity. It's stronger than Defying Danger with Dex, because Wire Fu allows you to accomplish things that normal people can't do, such as running quickly across narrow ledges, snatching arrows out of the air, or performing incredible feats of gymnastics.

Varying it by DEX score is a bit fiddly, and it's much more straightforward to give them a cool move like that outright, or as an advance. For instance, maybe they start with an unarmed strike that gives them close and hand range, and can take a move that adds reach.<br/><br/>Of course, flavor-wise, it's still a bit bland, though not much more bland than, say, some Fighter or Paladin options to increase damage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439866/#Comment_439866" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-03T16:46:50+00:00" title="November  3, 2014  4:46PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideally it would be tied to Ki somehow.

In Dungeon World, you're encouraged to make moves with all of your ability scores, and it's not the end of the world so long as you have at least a +0 in the relevant scores. That gives you a strong chance to at least get a 7-9 result on moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440028/#Comment_440028" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-09T12:27:32+00:00" title="November  9, 2014 12:27PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true, but I think for most classes their primary class moves are centered around one or two stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440373/#Comment_440373" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-23T00:24:12+00:00" title="November 23, 2014 12:24AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This should be the final version for the Reloaded Monk.
