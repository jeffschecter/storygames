                    So folks are really excited about Deborah Donoghue's game in which <a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=82" rel="nofollow">players geek out about clothes and lipgloss</a>.  <br/><br/>I suspect this happens in a lot of roleplaying groups where the players share interest in a particular thing and geek out about it as part of play.  In fact, some games have this built in, like geeking out about martial arts in <i>Feng Shui</i> ("So I back up several feet so I can do a butterfly kick...") or TV tropes when playing <i>Primetime Adventures</i>.<br/><br/>So I wanna hear about more Actual Play experience where players decided to really focus on some shared interest, almost to the expense of everything else.  I can imagine games where players geeked out about armor or languages or religion or heavy metal or ethnography or poker or poetry or cooking (like the feast descriptions in <i>Redwall</i> books) or any number of things, but I want to hear about ones that actually happened.<br/><br/>Here's one of mine:<br/><br/>I once referenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Tobit" rel="nofollow">the Book of Tobit</a> (which I had just read) while running a <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> game.  The other players were like, "The Book of Tobit?  You made that up right?"  And we then spent the next 20 minutes discussing the story of Tobit and what I knew about the book's origins.  And then, as the game went on, I tried to bring up references to as many semi-canonical or non-canonical scriptures as I could, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_thomas" rel="nofollow">The Gospel of Thomas</a> to <i>The Apostasis of the Archons</i>.  It rocked, but really had little to do with the plot.                </div>

                            I ran Changeling for a group including two women -- one a black belt, the other in law enforcement -- and so I did not expect it when they, like the women in the referenced thread, began to geek out on what they were wearing. Establishing their outfits was practically a part of framing the scene. They'd ask me detailed questions about what my NPCs were wearing, too, and so brought me in on the fun. I ended up amused and entertained.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm producing a PTA series about mutant teens at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, and we totally geek out on canon Marvel characters whenever they show up in our alternate continuity. I'm afraid sometimes that the canon characters steal the show from the protagonists!                        </div>

                            I ran an online Nobilis game where one of the PC's was the Power of Dogs, and the dog theme really took over the game... there was an unhappy love triangle with the PC, a wolf-spirit, and an uplifted poodle.  It freaked me out a little at the time, but in retrospect, I should have totally run with it.                        </div>

                            Is there an important way in which 'geeking out' differs from 'bringing in something from your real world experience/knowledge'? Serious question. Is it the obsessiveness of it, the fact that it's a shared experience? Because I feel like players will naturally want to spend more time detailing parts of the fiction about which they feel knowledgeable, but maybe that's too general. <br><br>If I love flowers and suddenly there's this garden or whatever in the fiction, there's a twofold reaction where on the one hand I just like flowers, and so I like talking about them and thinking about them -- and on the other hand there's a feeling like 'aha, this is really something I know about, so when I share it with the group that will make it more valuable.'  This sounds similar to the Book of Tobit example. But dissimilar to cases where the entire group loves flowers, and so when flowers come up everyone is riffing off it and enjoying it -- but there's less of that feeling of making a unique contribution.                        </br></br></div>

Daniel (Wood),<br/><br/>I think it qualifies as geeking out if:<br/>-the knowledge is obscure and arcane. Most people don't know it.<br/>-you have a near expert amount of knowledge on it.<br/>-you get into huge (and perhaps heated or passionate) discussion about it even when it isn't relevent.<br/><br/>In our group, I'd say that we geek out about philosophy, metaphysics, math/physics theory, and literary stuff.<br/>Kirk often interrupts to talk about a book which play is reminiscent of.<br/>Jeremy is always eager to explain something or other.<br/>We've spent significant time talking metaphysics and philosophy and such (if I recall correctly).<br/><br/>I think that's definitely geeking out. It's involved discussion of an obscure topic, and the 'geeking out' allows us to endorse and encourage that kind of discussion.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure this counts, but it seems relevant to this discussion.<br/><br/>I few months ago, some non-gaming buddies of mine asked me to run a roleplaying game for them.  I think my friend Maria said something like "A proper one, with elves and wizards and experience points and stuff."<br/><br/>So I threw a little fantasy dungeon bash together.  I was using the Savage Worlds system because it's easy and uses lots of different polydice (something that seemed important to me when introducing someone who wants the full RPG "kill things and take their stuff" experience).  It also seemed that minis were in order to get the full feel for the thing.<br/><br/>Except that I don't have minis, so I used a bunch of Lego minifigs for the party.  I had 6 PCs created and built minifigs to represent each one before the game started.  (I was especially proud of the halfling figure, I got some short legs like the Lego Ewoks have).<br/><br/>The players pick characters.  Maria picks an Elf Ranger type, Claire grabs a Paladin and Caroline picks the Wizard.  Maria and Caroline then proceed to spend about 20 minutes getting their figures looking "just right", ensuring they have the correct colour hair, trousers and the right equipment ("No, I want a brown bow!").<br/><br/>I was in the kitchen getting dinner ready while all this was happening (the game was due to start after we'd eaten), but Robert and Chris spent the whole time talking about computers and letting the ladies get on with their clothing discussions while it was happening.                        </div>

                            When I ran my werewolf LARP, I put references to every werewolf movie I could think of (American Werewolf, Ginger Snaps , Dog Soldiers etc) plus every twee British countryside-based TV programme (All Creatures Great And Small, Heartbeat, Lovejoy). <br/><br/>Then the Meat Loaf game had lots of gratuitous Meat Loaf references. Of course.<br/><br/>Adam, there was a pirate LARP at the last convention I went to which had rules based on your costume. (Mind you, that LARP was one of the the reasons my game got cancelled, so not entirely happy memories).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I've been playing in a LARP that's (almost) entirely themed around Sopranos and poker.<br/><br/>I've run a series of one-shot games that are half-focused on exploring the local Holiday Culture; going to ferry (and get drunk), going to spend a weekend at cabing (and get drunk), going to spend a weekend in Mediterranean resort (and get drunk). The other half of them is to turn the exploration of the theme into surreal horror and suspence.                        </div>

Not done this so much, but i can see it happening with my latest gaming sessions over OpenRPG with someone who is as cyberpunk/steampunk nuts out as i am. So we have spent the first 2 some hours of gaming and barely gotten my character out of the house. Lots of family detail there.<br/>
<br/>
Although on the old Dark Conspiracy Sunday chats since often times everyone on was former or current military the thinly hid Gunbunny nature of us all would come out in full swing....                        </div>

                            I'm sure Ice Cream Emperor or someone else has said it before, maybe not in this thread, but all this is how MUSH role-play works most of the time. Conflicts spring up naturally out of play but the focus tends to be on everyday things. Slice-of-life role-play, we call it. If you want to read some role-play logs -- er, "transcripts" -- from my MUSH, Firan, go to the <a href="http://firan.legendary.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> and click "Player Logs and Humor" and find some logs and clicky and ready.<br/><br/>The log titled "<a href="The Infamous Feral Ferret Flock!" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Infamous Feral Ferret Flock!</a> contains a transcript of role-play, some ad hoc dice rolls (prefixed by ""), and various OOC chatter. Note that none of this uses a GM of any kind. Players often make dice rolls against their attributes and skills and determine themselves what happens. Rarely does a GM get called in to arbitrate a disagreement.<br/><br/>Most of the logs there are pure role-play with little interaction with coded systems. If there's interest, I can dig up logs of people engaging in the rare combat and so on, to show how people role-play around the code.                        </div>

<a href="http://nerohq.com/" rel="nofollow">NERO</a> (you know, running around in the woods hitting each other with foam swords) has rules in which the more relistic your armor looks, the better protection it provides.<br/><br/><br/>Our Nobilis game also had a lot of geeking out on stuff, particularly Cooking and History.  Cooking seems like an odd thing to be god of, but our player really loved cooking, and was ridiculously creative at using foodstuff in odd ways: Gingerbread houses! Creation of Baking Soda to put out fires! Fruit Smoothies made from the fruits of the Garden of Eden!  Turduckens!  I think the Nobilis Domain deal lends itself very well to geeking out, as whatever your geekery is will be guaranteed an important part of the game.                        </div>

                            Playing Tokyo Heroes seems to work best if everyone geeks out about sentai/Power Rangers.<br/><br/>I try to avoid anything that gives people opportunities to be geeky about firearms, since my group has an NRA member and a military buff, who will get into arguments about fine details that the rest of the group doesn't care about.                        </div>
