                    Thanks for watching and/or joining!  I'm going to lay out the rules and purpose of this site, post by post.<br/><br/>First, the <b>MISSION STATEMENT</b> for this site:<br/><b>This site is a place to loosely describe Role Playing Games. Specifically, new ways to play RPGs and new ways of approaching the hobby. This site is meant to be a relaxed, non-threatening, non-confrontational environment to discuss the above.</b><br/><br/>This first post discusses the <b>RULES</b> of the forum.<br/><br/><b>The rules for joining:</b><br/>* Strive to treat other participants with respect.<br/>* Strive to talk constructively, even on fun and fluff.<br/>* Criticism and Discussion of ideas is kosher. <br/>* If you are bitter about something, do not express that bitterness here. Find another venue for bitterness.<br/><br/><b>The rules for communication:</b><br/>* Go nuts<br/>* Discussion topics: Anything tangentially related to gaming, or that can be folded back into a gaming discussion.<br/>* Don't bicker. As I mention, Criticism and Discussion of any idea that rolls through, even "brutal but friendly peer deconstruction", is cool (Friendly <b>&gt;</b> Brutal). Bickering is not kosher. Bickering or snark directed at other members here ruins the <i>zen</i>.  If you mess with the zen, you'll be kicked (possibly warned first). <br/>* Swearing and the like is fine, but<br/>* Please do not swear at other people. Disagree, disprove, "don't take their crap", all are fine. Namecalling, finger-pointing, anything that would cause people to lower their voices and look over at you at a cocktail party, all that is right out. This goes back to the theme of respect. <br/>* If someone consistently pisses you off, email/Whisper them and work it out. Or whisper me ("Andy"). Or take it off-site. In most cases, it comes down to a simple miscommunication fostered by The Internet.<br/><br/><b>The Rules for Grievances</b><br/>* Try to work it out amongst yourselves. Again, maybe use a respectful way of saying, "Cut it out", "We will have to agree to disagree", etc.<br/>* Email me. Check my profile (Andy) for my email address.<br/><br/><b>The Rules for Recruiting People:</b><br/>* Please feel free to tell people about this place directly. Please don't spam other groups or mailing lists, but feel free to link to threads and discussions here.<br/>* And pass along these guidelines to those you recruit.<br/><br/><b>The rules for Improvement:</b><br/>* Feel free to make suggestions, particularly about potential Categories or category splits.<br/><br/><b>Who to listen to:</b><br/>* <b>Minister Overmind</b> is the Master Admin account. You will probably never see him post again after 1.20.2006, unless something big is happening. <br/>* <b>Andy</b> is my Real Account, which I will use for posting, handing down admin verdicts, etc. We are the same person.<br/>My rule is cruel but just.  Maybe a little of both, or a lot of neither. We'll see.                </div>

<b>The Purpose and Direction of Story Games</b><br/><br/>This forum was basically created to be a midway point between RPGNet and The Forge.<br/><br/><b>This site is a place to loosely describe Role Playing Games. Specifically, new ways to play RPGs. New ways of approaching the hobby.</b><br/><br/>I love the friendly geeky discussion on RPGNet ("What game would be best for Firefly???"). But I don't like the bitterness, the attitude, the bickering and the screaming.<br/><br/>I love the directed discussion of gaming theory-as-practice and actual play, gamebuilding of The Forge, but I also want my geek friendly gaming chatter, too.<br/><br/>So this is basically a discussion playground for role-playing games. Here's some ground rules about ettiquette and the use of these forums:<br/><br/>* <b>LEARN HOW TO WHISPER</b>. This is the first thing you should do. If you use "Whisper your comments to (optional)" when you post, that means that ONLY THAT PERSON can see your post. If you whisper to yourself, only YOU can see your post. <b>If you see a post in a thread that is Another Color (yellow, brown, etc) that means that someone is Whispering to you</b>. You can tell because after their name it says "to you". You can Whisper Back to them by clicking the "Whisper Back" next to their name in that post. <br/><br/>It can get awkward if you reply to Everyone when replying to someone whispering to you.<br/><br/>* If you really want game solid "from the ground up" building advice, go to The Forge, RPGNet or TheRPGSite depending on your flavor. Seriously, the Forge is the workshop for that stuff, and I'm not going to try to recreate that community here.<br/><br/>* Throwing us an idea about a game you have in mind? Are you a part-lurker who had some Little Idea you had to get off your chest and get some feedback for? Awesome. We'll try to help. But again, if you join this forum for the sole purpose of getting help with your game design, this is <b>definitely</b> the wrong place to start. Again, see The Forge, RPGNet, TheRPGSite.<br/><br/>* If you decide to stick around, become familiar with your Accounts page. You can change your stylesheet to a format which works for you, add RSS2 links to your gaming blog, and lots of other fun stuff. You can connect to others, all "Web2.0 style".<br/><br/>* You may bring to life agian a "dead" (old) discussion by posting to it.  Someone may point out, "Hey, since that discussion there was this OTHER discussion Over Here (link) that you may want to post to instead", but otherwise there's no problem with reviving dead discussions, especially with new ideas.  I would suggest, though, that if that old discussion was huge, or you had a change in thinking since that previous discussion, feel free to open a new discussion on the same or similar topic to keep them logically seperated.<br/><br/>* You can select what type of coding you want to use when you post: Plain Text, HTML, BBCode, Markdown. HTML is the "default" for this site (though Plain Text will always be supported as well), and the rest is in there just for comfort. There are some limitations to BBCode and Markdown which you may discover by trial and error.<br/><br/>* Editing your posts for grammar, spelling, or to reprocess your thoughts, or if you accidentally posted to the wrong discussion, etc is totally cool. Please don't overdo it with editing your posts to completely change the nature of your post.<br/><br/>* If you see something awesome at another forum or on someone's blog, post it here in the <b>Links</b> category. People can feel free to jump over to that area to discuss the topic there. Or, if you want to meta-discuss it here (as in "Why it's being discussed over there), that's cool too.<br/><br/>* If you want to tell us to look at something awesome you are working on, please use the <b>Directed Self Promotion</b> category.<br/><br/>* Actual Play: "Cool gaming moments" are fine. You don't have to build up a huge story to tell us the one or two awesome things that happened at gaming last night. A paragraph, a few sentences, are totally fine for an Actual Play post.<br/><br/>* Theory discussion here at Story Games:  This isn't much of a "Theory" forum, it's more of a Praxis (in the Marxist sense: Discussion of unalienated gaming labor tied to practice and acts) place, where we talk about stuff but apply it to games directly. Discussion specifically related to creating, marketing, publishing, selling etc games is totally fine. I'll eventually put my foot down if I see too much theory not tied to practice with gentle moderation ("So, what does that have to do with gaming?" etc). There's plenty of other awesome places to discuss "theory before it hits your game or the table".<br/><br/>* Political, religious, sexual, or other topics that don't involve a game or gaming go Elsewhere. If you seriously relate them to gaming, then awesome!  ...but tread lightly.<br/><br/>* Keep the taunts, bickering and personal attacks to a minimum: Like "Zero". Also, we're buddies with other forums and playgrounds.<br/><br/>* Finally, one last ending note on Whispers: Whispers are cool, but they are quite unlike "Private Messages" on other forums: You can't erase them yourselves. So if you get into a Whispered Discussion that you think is going to take a wihle to resolve, please feel encouraged to take the discussion to email. Mainly because it's going to be harder for you to come back and find/reference those discussions.                        </div>

<b>What to Expect from the Moderators</b><br/><br/>* There currently is only one moderator: Me. A few others have the ability to approve users (to cut the lagtime down) and edit posts (see why below), but they are not "Administrators/Moderators" for Story Games.<br/><br/>* No one gets banned here unless they mess with the <i>zen</i> of this place. It's up to me to decide what constitutes "messing with zen", but you'll probably be warned before you're banned. At the top of my head, only "starting a bunch of shit", "totally disregarding the purpose of the site", or "treating others with a lack of respect" would be bannable at this point. Banned users become Entombed.<br/><br/>* The Moderator (me) and the helpers can Edit Others' Posts. This is because if you forget to close a tag in HTML, or have another bizarre Markdown/BBCode mismatch, it can affect the rest of the posts in that thread. We can go in and fix your post if there's a technical problem. Otherwise, we would only edit your post to put a "thread starter" in the correct category.<br/><br/>* The Moderator (me and me only) has the ability to see Whispered comments. While I don't wade or gleefully follow private conversations, I only retain this feature to make sure the site isn't getting loaded/bogged down with private discussions (that may be best taken to email if they go on too long) and other general Anti-Terrorist Sneaky Surveillance and Legal Reasons (User A to User B: "Let's Conspire to Gang Up on User C!"/"Let's fly airplanes into the Story-Games Server!"/"Let us concoct and consume crystal methamphetamines while uploading cihld porn to Story Games!"). Your private discussions will remain private, but if the thought that I (and I alone) may wander in on a private hidden note to someone, please feel free to take your discussion to email.<br/><br/>Again, I don't abuse that ability (the forum doesn't seperate "Whispers" from "Normal" discussions in a meaningful way), but I wanted to be candid in the fact that I do have that ability.<br/><br/>* User or discussion Moderation: I may ask of you to stop some behavior that I find harmful/zen-killing. Please abide. For discussions, I wouldn't kill a discussion, but I would (rarely, though) ask for participants in a discussion to "get to the point".<br/><br/>* Finally, from time to time I will take minor/unimportant discussions (mostly "Forum Discussion" topics that have been Long since answered or simply don't apply anymore) and nuke them to keep the database light. Do not be alarmed, no "real" discussion will be targeted in this way.                        </div>

<b>What is a Story Game?</b><br/><br/><b>Story Games</b>... is the name of this website/forum, dedicated to the discussion of <i>playing</i> Role-Playing Games.<br/><br/><b>A Story Game</b>... is another word for A Role-Playing Game. Defined as "A <i>game</i> where you play a <i>role</i>". This covers a lot, A LOT, of ground.<br/><br/>Most of the games we discuss are tabletop roleplaying games, much more than live action roleplaying, or computer/console gaming (not the focus of the site).<br/><br/>While all role-playing games are kosher to talk about here at Story Games, you'll probably see a lot of discussion focused towards smaller press games, or "dirty hippie games", like roleplaying games that focus more on relationships, or story-building, or on "our story" over "my character". That's cause there's not a lot of other places to discuss those sorts of things, so folks interested in that tended to gravitate here: Beyond that, exploring cool new ways to play any sort of game is a welcome topic here. The lesser-known games we discuss here often are no more important or "better" than other games or game styles (adventure games, etc). Nor by definition must the games we discuss here contain certain rules or playstyles, emphasis or de-emphasis on a central game-master, light/crunchy rules, etc. <br/><br/>Story Gamers are not better. We are not the Chosen Ones. We simply do things a little differently.                        </div>

                            Note: I'll eventually be consolidating these posts into one massive FAQ or something. But for now, just going to add to this thread:<br/><br/>Originally posted in this discussion:<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16440" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16440</a><br/><br/>'ve alluded to "moderation team" in a few posts and over on the Story Games Google Plus page. I hadn't announced it with the appropriate fanfare that I wanted (with little bios and stuff) because I've been backed up from work, life, etc. I will be doing such a thing soon.<br/><br/>Story Games is luckily not really approaching the "too much for one guy" limit yet, but about six months ago I realized that I needed some checks, some sounding board, some people to help moderate (giving them the same authoritative power that I do - that level of trust) in the places that I can't see. People whose opinion I trust and respect, ESPECIALLY where it diverges from my own. So here are the people I asked to help, and these are your moderators:<br/><br/><b>Andy</b> (Andy Kitkowski, that's me)<br/><br/><b>Jason Morningstar</b> (Jason Morningstar) - Designer, Critic, Fast Draw, Tolerates far less than me, and S-G is so much better for it<br/><br/><b>jenskot</b> (John Stavropoulos) - A social media genius who shares my notion/ideal of empathy, understanding, and also shares a nose for social maneuvering/bullshit<br/><br/><b>anansigirl</b> (Kira Scott) - A true warrior-poet, she has fought for the community with empathy and brilliance, and has brought several interesting perspectives in private discussions<br/><br/><b>Zac in Virginia</b> (Zac Dettwyler) - Born in the social critique pits and hardened by rational discourse, he presents things in new ways, from multiple angles<br/><br/>So there we are. A critical and empathic team of different backgrounds and races (no, I wasn't gunning for a Captain Planet cadre, it just kinda worked out that way)... well, save that we're all currently American (but John shares my hair-trigger for issues of American/Western monoculturalism, I'm hoping that counts), that couldn't be avoided. Four other people who also wield the same power I do. We usually talk about stuff before we act on it, but sometimes need forces our hand.<br/><br/>But in the end, nothing dramatic: They've actually been in this role - with all the power and all that - for a few months now, I've just been too busy (read Lazy) to get around to a grand introduction. So this is the mini version.<br/><br/><b>Who do you contact when you have a problem or question?</b><br/><br/>Default, if you just want to reach out to anybody: Whisper me. Or email me (ziggurat ATMARK gmail DOT com).<br/><br/>Alternately, if there's a particular moderator who you particularly trust or have a connection with, feel free to whisper directly to them instead.<br/><br/>Whichever works for you.                        </div>

<b>Introducing a new Story Games rule! </b><br/><br/>Introduced to us by Giulia B, this rule is used on GenteCheGioca, aka “Story Games: Italy”. We think this rule has the potential to really improve some difficult or sensitive subjects, while at the same time nearly impossible to abuse. So we are applying it here at Story Games.<br/><br/>Here’s the rule: It is called “<b>SLOW DOWN</b>”.<br/><br/>=====<br/><b>SLOW DOWN</b><br/><br/><b>Intention:</b> When discussions get heated, sometimes people talk past each other and stop listening. Or people “gain ground” or “win” the discussion simply because they have far more free time to post, and post to the point that other voices are drowned out. Traditionally, we have Sunk or Closed these threads when they got out of hand, but we’re going to try a new method out. It is a tool to foster listening, thinking and empathy before replying to hot issues.<br/><br/><b>Implementation:</b><br/>* The discussion’s creator and the admin team can turn Slow Down on, or turn it off.<br/>* If the discussion’s creator (or admin) believes that the discussion is getting heated and people aren’t listening (or are posting too quickly without reflecting, etc), they can start Slow Down by creating a post in the thread which simply says something to the extent of:<br/>“Hey everyone, I’m turning on Slow Down. Please abide by the rules for Slow Down”.<br/>(and add a link to the Slow Down rules to this post)<br/>* This can be used at the start of a thread, if you think the discussion is likely to be contentious. However, do not overuse this feature.<br/>* The discussion creator or admin edits the first post in the thread: They change the Thread Title, adding the words “[SLOW DOWN]” at the beginning of the discussion title.<br/><br/><b>Ex:</b><br/>“I had a weird experience at a convention” ---&gt; “[SLOW DOWN] I had a weird experience at a convention”<br/>* If Slow Down was started by an admin, then an admin can stop Slow Down.<br/>* If Slow Down was started by the thread/discussion creator, then only they (or an admin under unusual circumstances) can stop Slow Down.<br/>* To turn off/stop Slow Down, the creator or admin simply creates a post to the extent of:<br/>“Hey everyone, I’m turning off Slow Down”<br/>* Then, she can edit the thread title, removing the words “[SLOW DOWN]” from the beginning.<br/><br/><b>Slow Down Rules:</b><br/>* During a period of Slow Down, from the point of the “I am implementing Slow Down” post” onwards, each participant only gets to post **one single public reply in the discussion per 24-hour day**. If you’re wondering the start point of that “day”, use your own time zone. If there is contention on this point, then the “day” will begin 24:00 GMT/UTC.<br/>* There are no exceptions. If the admin or discussion creator revokes the Slow Down status but requests that the posters follow additional rules or guidelines throughout the thread, follow them.<br/>* For further communication with thread participants during a Slow Down period, we highly encourage people continue communication or take their discussion to other channels like private whispers, email, G+, etc.<br/><br/><b>Caveats:</b><br/>* If the admin believe that the discussion creator is implementing SLOW DOWN in a way not representative of its intentions (Ex: To “win” an argument; and not to foster better communication) we’ll whisper or email them our thoughts in a private warning.<br/>* Don’t re-edit your post to respond to things that people say after your post; simply reply the next day if you felt like you had more to say.<br/>* Do not harass the discussion creator regarding their decision to implement Slow Down. If you suspect misuse, contact an admin.<br/>* If an admin and the thread creator differ in opinion as to when Slow Down should be started or stopped, the admins will discuss this with the thread creator in private.<br/>* We will also address overuse of the tool: If one person uses it to a degree we find too frequent, we’ll address that in private. Frivolous overuse can lead to private warnings, up to removing your privilege to institute this rule.<br/>* If you have questions or concerns about the use of Slow Down in a thread, whisper or contact an admin.<br/>=====<br/>Note: In the forum software we use, “Threads” are called “Discussions”, which is why we alternate between talking about the original “thread creator” and “discussion creator” (same thing).<br/><br/>Hopefully we won’t need to use this for some time. <b>If you feel the need to try it out, PLEASE DON’T. That’s not the point.</b> </div>
