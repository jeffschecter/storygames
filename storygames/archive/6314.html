Taking slave-made prisoners and dissecting them to "add" to the more "beautiful" specimens, making super-soldiers...  Some for muscle, most for spy-driven infiltration.  All perfect.  All beautiful.<br/>\n-   The agents are sent to quiet their mark, a singer in a cabaret who'd been saying things she shouldn't... (ie. talking about the strange type things).<br/>\n-   At the club they speak with their mark  (none other than Ms. Josephine Baker!)  and  soon learn that the club is functioning as a lab for creating these beautiful beasts.<br/>\n-   The surprise... Ms. Baker IS one of them!!  She (along with many many other prominent entertainers/polititians, etc...)  have already been "modified".  Stronger, Better, Beautiful!  Her entire point of "leaking" gossip and questioning about monsters, etc.. was to lure RPA agents to the club so she could learn where the RPG HQ is to send the Morlocks after it!!!   (although they DID fall for Ms. Baker, thinking she was an innocent - luckily for the RPA the agents didn't fall for the overall plot to reveal the HQ!!)<br/>\n-   As 1 of the 3 agents is left alone with her (before learning the truth), the other two start to learn of the Nazi troops within the labrynthian club basements.<br/>\n-   Hiding from Ms. Bakers ("modified") pet cheetah (yes, she really had a pet cheetah in real life!!), they find (are found by) the dregs, the ugly, the "Morlocks" that are the unsuccessful experiments, now sad and hungry... very very hungry!!<br/>\n-   Escaping, the 2 agents rush to find the Nazi Doctor.  Meanwhile, unknown to the others, Ms Baker leads the other agent into the depths of the Nazi lab seeing the horrors and more.  Heroically the agent turns Ms Baker's trust (that had been fostered)  and silently kills the compromised-starlet.  (by this time the agent had gotten Ms Baker to trust that she was working WITH the Nazi, and had revealed the plans of infiltration - noting that they'd already replaced many stars/politicians including a certain buxom blond bombshell in the US and was looking into Joe Kennedy's beautiful young lads for future political mechinations!!<br/>\n-   Culminating in the club's kitchen/lab,  the agents separately converge in to confront the good doctor - the 1st agent getting the drop on him as a friend, the others plugging him as he tried to escape!  <br/>\n-   And deep below the lab explodes, with the club (the Noise &amp; Smoke) collapsing in on itself from the 1st agent's make-shift bomb!<br/>\n-   As the agents escape, their hidden agendas force the German Agent (PC) to separate (trying to recover the head/brain of the doctor for his superiors!)  which the Brit Agent (PC) works to not allow him to work independently and escape.  And the Russian Agent (PC) escapes herself with the notes/blueprints of the doctor!<br/>\n-   the "curtain" closes in the U-Bahn lobbies, with the camera showing the Russian &amp; German Agents independently putting their "trophies" in private lockers.  The lockers close, and we focus on the docks - a quick pull-away camera shot into the sky looking down on the Brit Agent screaming in rage from the betrayals, then smirks knowing he'll work with them again one day....  as the Noise &amp; Smoke cabaret burns in the background!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\na fun mission that I made up over the week...<br/>\nrule thoughts/questions next!<br/>\n<br/>\nany comments/questions?<br/>\n-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140348/#Comment_140348" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T11:38:22+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 11:38AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rule questions we had some thoughts about...<br/>\nAny help is appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#1.   <br/>\nWhen a PC makes a success in NON-combat conflicts, how and how MANY "consequences" are taken?  <br/>\n-   One thought was that the rules imply that you combat and non-combat conflicts BOTH use the exact same rules for taking consequences.  (so... if you roll 4 successes to outwit the Nazi seductress, and your "stake" was to get her to spill the true plans  -  she takes 4 levels of consequences just like a combat)<br/>\n-   The other thought is that non-combat is stand-alone different than combat.  Any success just grants the appropriate narration and no actual consequence (numbers) are taken by the opponent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#2.<br/>\nWhen rolling dice,  do you STOP when comparing dice after the first dice equalling the same value come up?  Only taking the number of dice consequences that are ABOVE that?  <br/>\nOr do you take away that equalled die then continue down the die pool,  continuing to add successes IF the winner still has higher dice.<br/>\nExample:<br/>\nGM rolls:  10, 7, 5, 4, 2, 2<br/>\nPC rolls:   10, 10, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 5<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\nIs the result:   <br/>\nPC wins with 6 successes  (10 &amp; 9 cancel,  10-9-8-8-7-6 success, second 7 cancels  and  5 cancels/ends the conflict pool)<br/>\nor<br/>\nPC wins with 4 success  (10 cancels,  10-9-8-8 success, the first 7 cancels/ends the conflict pool)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#3.<br/>\nWhen the GM creates a conflict that is NOT contested by an NPC, is there a guideline on how many dice to roll?  (ie.  Is there or should there be a "difficulty" chart for suggestions on how many dice equal each level of success?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#4. <br/>\nShifting Attributes and/or Traits are a part of consequences.  (we kept forgetting to do this after scenes)<br/>\nHow often and how much should these normally shift?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#5. <br/>\nHow (or do you) would you have PCs roll for "spot" or "sense motive" type checks?  If an NPC is trying to hide something (but you don't want to alert the players unnecessarily)  or  if the players should have a chance of seeing a clue -  what rolls do you ask for?  How?  How many?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#6.<br/>\nWe scored a majority of the lower level successes in our game  (1-2, slight-standard successes) with a handful of the bigger successes.  I had trouble understanding HOW/what to narrate for (and WHO narrates) the lower level successes.  Since the successes are marginal should the GM narrate?<br/>\nI also felt some of my players didn't expand on their "superior-superlative" successes as much as they could/should have.  I'd love to see more examples/suggestions for the success levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#7.<br/>\nI highly encouraged players to creatively choose which Attribute they used (in and out of combat) when rolling a conflict.  For example, using your Inflence while blasting shots into the opposition (intimidating more than damaging it).  Is this the correct approach?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#8.<br/>\nWe adapted to having the NPCs (especially mooks) take their "damage" consequences directly/only in their Action Attribute.  Is this a good approach?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#9. <br/>\nNegative Traits... while we all loved the negative trait die and how it effects narration, we needed more examples of how to narrate these successes better....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#10.<br/>\nWe played and "open" game with Agendas,  however I also gave a 2nd National Agenda specific to THIS mission which was kept hidden (or "closed").  That seemed to be very fun.  Is adding multiple secondary "mission" agendas appropriate to the design of the rules?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#11.  <br/>\nI determined that NPCs (even villains) could have "Trust" in the PC or their own allies.  I actually gave trust dice to a PC at one point when the agent was looking to surprise and turn on that trust to stop the villain (using subterfuge).    Again, is this appropriate to the design of the rules?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#12.<br/>\nOne thing I'd like to see added to the description of trust rules is how in MANY of your spy/cold war type fiction I feel that players should know (and roleplay) how the trust/betrayal is often "business is business" and in most cases the point of the spy-game is to note when you've been beaten, drop the trust slightly and feign that trust until the time when you can succeed in your goals.  A betrayal shouldn't necessarily equal a fellow agent becoming the enemy.  In the spy game it is considered unprofessional to be a sore loser...  Then again even a spy can only be pushed so far... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for the advice.<br/>\n-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140416/#Comment_140416" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T16:13:23+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  4:13PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Kev,<br/><br/>Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.

With the caveat that slight successes give no consequences. In combat situation, you add the damage of the weapon being used.<br/><br/>So, Mr Rogers fires a submachinegun at someone and gets two successes. This means that 4 points of consequences must be assigned.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/>Using your pool examples, the PC would win with 4 successes. The GMs 10 and the PCs first 10 are both removed, leaving the PC with 4 dice higher than the GMs highest die.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/>It's very much GM determined, but moving up in odd numbered increments is what I tend to do, e.g: 3 for something not particularly challenging, up to 9 for a serious situation.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.<br/>Changes should always take place after the conflict in question. The shifts will be dictated by how many consequences points are being spent.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>.<br/>I wouldn't ask for a roll, I'd tell the players that the NPC was hiding something. That means the players can then guide the actions of their characters into a conflict that could result in things being revealed. Simply sensing that someone is lying isn't really important, it's what the lie is about and how it changes the story that is important.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>.<br/>The winner is encouraged to ask others to add to the description of the outcome, perhaps adding in little bits of colour regarding their own characters, but the winner is the 'gatekeeper' of what is established through narration. Everyone round the table has the right to contribute, but the winner of a conflict is the final arbiter of what is included, what detail is added and whose characters' actions are featured in the narration.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a>.<br/>If the use of an attribute is appropriate, then yes. However, it is recommended in the text that Action is the attribute to use in combat. However, this depends what you are trying to achieve. If you want to shoot someone, then yes, Action is the way to go. However, if the intent is to make someone surrender without shooting them, then Influence would be ideal. It's all a matter of intent and what the individual or group wishes to achieve.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a>.<br/>That would be one way. I tend to spread it around, depending on the situation. But, if you are going for a fast-flowing, cinematic style, then that's A-OK.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%239&amp;Mode=like">#9</a>.<br/>No worries, here's another example:<br/><br/>Wilson is involved in a conflict and Debbie chooses to bring in the negative trait "Doesn't think things through" to get an additional die in her pool. The conflict is based on Insight and takes place during a long scene where Wilson is attempting to tail what he thinks is a Soviet officer through the backstreets of Berlin.<br/><br/>When the dice are rolled, Wilson wins the conflict. However, the highest number rolled was a 10 and this came up on the die that represented the negative trait. This means that although watson has succeeded in tracking the Soviet officer successfully, something has gone awry during the process. <br/><br/>Debbies thinks on this and suggests that although the tail was successful and Wilsonhas discovered the safehouse where the officer is living, this has led poor Watson into the territory of a particularly violent local gang. He only realises this when he sees warning signs against strangers plastered on the dirty walls. Then he starts worrying.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a>.<br/>Hmmm, I'd suggest against that, as the decision to have one national and one personal agenda was a particular design choice. They are powerful things within the context of the game and not to be taken lightly. They can heavily sway situations in favour of the PCs. However, if it's proving fun for you and your group, then it would be churlish to say no!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%2311&amp;Mode=like">#11</a>.<br/>The game was design to reflect the trust between a confined group of people, i.e.: the RPA team. Extending this outwith the confines of the team would make the game quite different,s o it's not something I've ever done. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%2312&amp;Mode=like">#12</a>.<br/>It's an interesting point that I will certainly take on board. Thanks for your thoughts on that.<br/><br/>I hope my answers help you in some way. If not, then do feel free to shout back!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140548/#Comment_140548" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-20T10:01:15+00:00" title="April 20, 2008 10:01AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All very helpful.<br/>\nThanks again for the great game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the future plans for Cold City?
