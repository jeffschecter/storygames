They inhabit the same world by virtue of pursuing goals directed at the same set of NPC Guest Stars, with the Guest Stars acting as a small degree of glue to unify the fiction.  The result is more like reading one issue apiece of Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk and Thor rather than reading four issues of the Avengers.  Mostly, I think this works out fine.  But could another solution be better?  After playing at Camp Nerdly, Keith had this to say (from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=379167" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BlazmoIntoWowee</cite>That was definitely fun.  One thing I particularly enjoyed that I was wondering if you could codify is how elements of each of our stories popped up as background in the other villains' stories, like when King Orzomon was there when Captain Metropolis showed up to give Coldblood the Nobel Peace Prize.  I think it would keep the game from being four unrelated stories.</blockquote>It's definitely cool when that happens!  I've run into a lot of downsides in trying to <i>make</i> it happen, though.  I either give people instructions that are easily lost and forgotten among the rules, or I give rules that warp the game's incentives away from the character and story-telling stuff as it currently stands.  <br/><br/>Hmm, though it might be okay for a GM to earn a token for bringing another villain into the scene when they're GMing...  <br/><br/>Villains who get brought into each other's scenes get more opportunity to earn Fan Points, though, and I don't want a popularity spiral...<br/><br/>Perhaps you get a token only for bringing in the character of the player to your left.  That'll be the character who's been offscreen longest at that point.  It'd often be hard to do; certainly much harder than just bringing in whichever villain has already established a connection to the scene's Guest Star.  So I'm not sure about that balance -- it might be just right, or it might not be enough to bother.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379218/#Comment_379218" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T00:43:11+00:00" title="May 22, 2012 12:43AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you look at models from other games?

We chose a shared fate/destiny/whatever it's called, we shared some NPCs (my Full Moon is your New Moon, etc.), and we appeared in each other's scenes a bit.  We did this because we thought it'd be fun, but I think the shared concerns of (a) the Mistake and (b) the coming of the end of Polaris made it seem natural.  There also didn't seem to be any reason <i>not</i> to do this.<br/><br/>In early versions of Within My Clutches, I attempted to give the villains an overlapping concern: Captain Universe, hero of heroes, who would eventually foil all their plans if no one stopped him/her/it.  I eventually abandoned the concept because it felt tacked on.  There just wasn't a natural way to inject Captain Universe into what the villains were already doing.<br/><br/>One of the core features of WMC characters is that they're proactive, not reactive.  Each scene is based on a goal, and players' imaginations consistently take them to weird new settings for new goals.  Going from a cubicle in scene 1 to an asteroid in scene 2 has turned out to be a frequent part of the fun.  So <i>unity</i> of fictional concerns isn't really on the table.  Instead what I have is <i>overlap</i> -- the NPC whose wealth I want to acquire is the same NPC whose respect you want to win.<br/><br/>Having said all that, posing the occasional challenge to the players at any given moment to integrate disparate threads might be fun, as per Contenders.

Writing stuff down for later and then remembering what it is and noticing the right spot to use it has often wound up at odds with in-the-moment roleplay (as player, GM, or even audience).  <br/><br/>I do like the idea, and in an earlier draft I had each player tracking the Distractions their GMing had produced for each other player, with these Distractions to be played (brought into a scene) as chosen.  And you got points for doing that.  If the game was all about earning such points (most points wins, or something), it might have worked.  But in a story-telling game where points are good but enjoying the fiction is better, it just wound up being a nuisance.  "Oh, wait, was I supposed to play that thing then?  What was it again?"  Your idea of investing specifically in stuff that you <i>decide</i> you <i>want</i> to reincorporate would be an improvement, but there's still the issue of tracking and whether anyone would bother.<br/><br/>NPC reincorporation is already hardwired, location diversity is part of the fun... but themes?  That's interesting.  I like the sound of that, but I'm having trouble imagining it.  Can you throw a hypothetical at me?  A moment of play, the marking of its theme, and then later, how it's invoked and brought into a new scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379731/#Comment_379731" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T05:46:05+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  5:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a virgin idea, totally provoked. For the purposes of bouncing.<br/><br/>A deck of themes the players choose at the start of the session. Jamie wants to see Betrayal, so writes that down on an index card. Alison is interested in the anxiety of her character, so she writes Insecurity on another card. Other players add "Corruption," "Consumption," etc. (Things like that. Apocalypse World and My Life with Master have gorgeous little theme words scattered through the text. Perhaps the game would offer these words in context, or just provide a list, or leave it up to the crew).<br/><br/><b>Fun later, part 1</b>:<br/>It's Jamie's turn. Her hero is in trouble. A terrible creature threatens her home town. She's going to lose a friend so she decides to introduce one of the themes on the table... She spends a token and picks Corruption. She helps the GM narrate how the creature forces her to choose another victim instead. Jamie keeps the card in front of her with a token on top.<br/><br/><b>Ask for more, part 1</b>:<br/>It's Alison's turn. Her hero is about to deliver a rising speech at a revolutionary rally. Some people want the character to mess things up and she's having a hard time focusing on what's important. Particularly, she is struggling with her own self worth. As she steps out to deliver the speech, she decides to introduce one of the themes, Insecurity. She and the GM narrate how her anxiety gets the better of her. She receives a token and hands the card to Jamie. "Hey Jamie, I'd like you to be in charge of Insecurity for a while," she says.<br/><br/><b>Fun later, part 2</b>:<br/>It's still Alison's turn, but Jamie decides that she'd like to reintroduce the Corruption theme. She takes the token from the theme for herself and places the Corruption card back in the pile(?). "I have a cool idea... I'd like to tie this in with your anxiety." Jamie and Alison narrate how a familiar man approaches, voicing wise, cutting truths. She is momentarily turned from the cause, and abandons the rally without delivering the speech.<br/><br/><b>Ask for more, part 2</b>:<br/>In another player's turn, the villain is about to win. There are civilians involved and death traps. Jamie jumps in. "I'd like to use the Insecurity theme please. I'd like to suggest that the villain try to recruit the hero. He needs a friend."

The game term is Factions.<br/><br/>The only way to have your protagonist have a conflict with a Faction is if another player takes ownership of that Faction and throws it at you.  It makes the players take interest, but not necessarily the player characters...<br/><br/>Also, every time your protagonist makes a "deal" with a Faction, that deal necessarily puts you at odds with another protagonist or their interest.<br/>"Yes, we will get for you this plutonium shipment, for the regular fee... but the cops are sniffing around.

I also don't recall what we were getting villain tokens <i>for</i>, beyond a vague "entertaining the table." I certainly don't remember what we could spend the villain tokens on, because I only ever got a few, Captain Fahrenheit being the Charlie Brown of supervillains.<br/><br/>Maybe instead of squeezing the "How to GM" rules into a corner of the sheet, you have a half-sheet or card that has them on it. And one of the things you can get a token for while GMing is reincorporating a previous happening, or introducing one of the other villains. You can also simply say that villains that are guest-starring in scenes cannot earn villain tokens, but <i>may</i> earn GM tokens.<br/><br/>Also, I'd really suggest two colors of token. I found it confusing to keep track of villain tokens vs. GM tokens.

The other players' characters appear as NPCs in their stories.  And having them in a scene grants bonuses. The bonus is not dependent on the attitude between the characters.  They could be enemies, but the bonus is still given.  This is an incentive for the player to involve the other players, and on the story level it makes the at first seemingly unrelated stories tie together and intersect.<br/><br/>So, basically what Polaris does when you put your character as a moon or mistake on another players char sheet, but with mechanical incentives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379894/#Comment_379894" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T00:19:29+00:00" title="May 28, 2012 12:19AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 12:21AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Sebastian</b>, ah, I get it.  Think it up, bust it out, designate it for subsequent use, and then reintroduce it (or call for someone else to) when you want.  Your examples with the call accompanied by a fictional suggestion seem fair -- put the burden for "how do we work that into this scene?" on the person who wants to invoke it.  I think your examples also show a downside, that it's hard to do this gracefully.  I imagine a whole lot of momentum and focus lost and derailed.  Scenes in Within My Clutches are supposed to be relatively short and to the point.  There's definitely room for showing us something about your character, but I think reconciling character vision with current objectives <i>and</i> a call for a moment that evokes a theme is too taxing.  I'd rather do two well than three poorly.<br/><br/><b>Harlequin</b>, good call on Remember Tomorrow.  I think the overlapping Guest Stars in Within My Clutches (your guy wants Captain Metropolis's love, while my guy wants her wealth) achieve about what Factions do in terms of bringing the world together a wee bit.  When I played Remember Tomorrow, it didn't feel particularly unified to me.  Maybe that's fine!  Just wondering if I could/should do better.<br/><br/>Making player characters go through each other to pursue their ends would be fun, but Within My Clutches requires that the spotlight character <i>must</i> be able to achieve their Goal.  Thus, on my turn, if I go to you to borrow your laser cannon, <i>me not getting it, and it mattering that I didn't get it</i> is not an option.  So now you must invent some reason why you <i>want</i> to give me this laser cannon (which maybe you hadn't planned on owning).  This doesn't seem like the best use of scene time to me... though maybe it could be cool as scene framing:<br/><br/>"What do you have with you when the scene begins, and which other character did you get it from?"  Then you pick another character and brainstorm for a bit about what could have gone down.  This refreshes that other character in the minds of the group and establishes some background that could be referenced later in play.<br/><br/>That'd be nice if everyone could do it quickly.  Racking brains on that one would be bad for play, methinks.  Maybe an optional rule...<br/><br/><b>Wilhelm</b>, I don't find it hard to simply throw protagonists into each other's scenes.  As you say, just provide a bonus.  That's not really what I'm looking for here, though.  In a given scene, the player of that scene's protagonist is the star and runs the show.  This is their chance to show us their character and pursue that character's goals, and the GM's number one responsibility is to help with those.  Inserting another player character into such a scene is risky!  That player needs to know this is <i>not</i> their spotlight, and that they have the same task as the GM, to support the current star.  I could simply ask people to keep that in mind, but if they're tired of waiting for their turn, or forget the rule, or just aren't used to switching gears that way, it's gonna blow up.  I'd rather err on the side of keeping things simple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379895/#Comment_379895" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T00:58:32+00:00" title="May 28, 2012 12:58AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 12:19PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael, those observations are important!

Like in the Tick, when Chairface Chippendale tries to write his name on the moon, it shows up in every subsequent shot of the moon for the rest of the series. It's a small touch, but it ties the fiction together.<br/><br/>A (rather belabored) example in our game was when Mona was kidnapped by Coldblood she was still pissed about the pie in the face embarassment. It's not mechanically significant, but its a nice tie-in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379947/#Comment_379947" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T11:04:29+00:00" title="May 28, 2012 11:04AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!  That sort of thing is pure goodness.  I wonder, perhaps the key ingredient is some sort of reminder?  I don't think those kind of connections are hard as long as someone thinks to try to make them.  Drawing from the field of all possible prior content is easier than looking at a smaller set of flagged items, I think.  "Start a scene with Captain Metropolis in it?  What did the last villain do with her?  How might that show up now?"  Maybe the rule is that the GM gets a token for introducing effects of a PC's earlier action, and the advice is to do this during scene framing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380370/#Comment_380370" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T15:17:27+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  3:17PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Maybe the rule is that the GM gets a token for introducing effects of a PC's earlier action, and the advice is to do this during scene framing. </blockquote>I think that's elegant. I love being rewarded as a GM when I highlight a consequence, and I love the reminder. Please let us know how it works out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
