                    _{Retroactively crossposted to RPGnet.}_<br/>
<br/>
I frequently find myself coming back to my Sorceror books, and have indeed played it, but still get hung up enough on the problems that I just keep it aside. So, goods/bads:<br/>
<br/>
* The die mechanic has been, in my group's experience, a bit high in the handling time. We did it as we should - just "What's your highest die? How many of yours beat my 7?" - but quite simply, in practice, for us, given our very subjective and finnicky aesthetics, IMHO, *it was a drag*. So I'm interested in a mechanic that doesn't have the "Sorceror/Donjon" kind of approach to the die pool; maybe I'd even prefer something without a die pool at all.<br/>
* Also: the die mechanic is really, really swingy, meaning both good (the little guy can triumph!) and bad (the big guy can continously be inept!). It's a balance thing, and I think I'd prefer a slightly less swingy mechanic, where earning bonus dice was a little more helpful on your side.<br/>
** w.r.t. the "inept" thing, it doesn't have to be a "whiff" per se using Fortune-in-the-Middle techniques, but even with that it wasn't quite right for our preferences<br/>
* I like the ideas behind the combat system (combining action roll + initiative with the tactical question of aborting for defense, etc.) although they were was somewhat high handling time in practice. (That might have just been experience though; I'd feel comfortable enough with Sorceror combat.)<br/>
* I do like the dice economy of score -&gt; dice -&gt; successes -&gt; bonuses -&gt; penalties. I do like the implementations of contact/summoning/binding/humanity to describe the demonic relationship. I like the very few stats!<br/>
<br/>
This morning, I came up with a die mechanic I really like. It seems compatible with Sorceror and _somewhat_ keeping within its sprits; it also yoinks gracefully from HeroQuest, which had it coming.<br/>
<br/>
*The Rules:* Wherever you normally roll N dice on your side, instead roll a single d10 [or a d12? I'm not sure]. (Just as you'll always roll at least 1 die, your N is always at least 1.) If the result is greater than your N, it's a "good" success; if it's less or equal, it's "great". Announce the number of your result and if it's good/great. (So I roll a 4 with my Lore, which is 5. I announce: "4-great".) Compare both sides' results:<br/>
<br/>
* great vs good: the "great" result wins, and the winner's die result is the number of successes<br/>
* great vs great: the higher result wins, and the difference in die results is the number of succeses<br/>
* good vs good: the higher result wins, with 1 success<br/>
* tie: coin flip!!! (Or perhaps, simply give 1 success to the underdog.)<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Clever rephrase. Great results always beat good results. Otherwise, the higher result wins. A "good" winner only gets one success. A "great" winner gets their die roll in successes; if the loser has "great" results, these cancel those out.<br/>
<br/>
And you proceed as normal.<br/>
<br/>
_Bonus Dice:_ You increase your N by the bonus. If both sides have a bonus, cancel it out so only one side has a bonus. If someone has more bonus than is actually useful, that's okay. (So if you have Stamina 7 and 5 bonus dice, your N is 13, which basically just means any result will be great; that's okay.)<br/>
<br/>
_Combat:_ Similar to the normal version:<br/>
<br/>
# Everyone picks actions until everything is free + clear.<br/>
# Everyone rolls their die, and this will be their roll for their action.<br/>
# Proceed in order of highest-die-result to lowest. (Yes, ignoring whether it's "great' or "good" for you.)<br/>
## EDIT: Actually, great results must go before good ones.<br/>
# To defend before you've used your action, you can either:<br/>
## Roll a separate die with an N of 1 (keeping your current result)<br/>
## Abort your action and roll defense, using whatever score you want.<br/>
# To defend after you've used your action, roll as normal.<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
So I think this can actually work. The die mechanics will have a different economy, but at first glance it doesn't look like this is too radically different. I feel like the underdog can still win, but the better player still has an advantage; you can always pull off at least 1 success, but never more successes than N (the number of dice you would have been rolling). The choice of die type definitely does matter here, so I'm not sure about my choice.<br/>

                            Nifty. Go go, design a game, go go go!!<br/>
<br/>
Thought about die size - seems to me ties ought to be kept rare, so d20 would be my first pick for playtesting.<br/>
<br/>

                            Hey dude, can you give a few examples with "real-seeming" examples?<br/><br/>Say, my 4 Stamina Sorcerer tries to beat up this 5 Stamina sorcerer. How does that play out?<br/><br/>How does it play out when my sorcerer uses strategy to get a bonus die?<br/><br/>How does that play out then when he takes his 2 or so successes and applies them to a Smack-Talk (Willpower) roll?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>I just got back from a playtest with a friend, and we liked how it worked so far! There are some things to work out, but I'll save that for a Forge post in the A.M. Let me address Andy's example.</p>
<p>Firstly, we figure out our actions until we're free and clear. (We decide we're going to beat on each other this round.) You have a clever strategy (blow sand in my eyes) so your score will be Stamina + 1 (5). I'm going to try to use my Cover (professional soldier, 5) to give me bonus dice to this action. So with a score of 5 on each die, I'm going to roll a d10 for me (9-good) against a d10 (6-good). I succeed with a 1 success, and get a +1 for my role.</p>
<p>Now we roll for our actions. You roll a d10 for your score of 5: 4-great. I roll a d10 for my score of 6: 8-good. You go first, attacking me with that result. I decide to abort my action and reroll d10 for dodging with my Stamina 5: 2-great. That's 2 successes you have against me. You're going to use those as bonus dice in the next round.</p>
<p>(What if I tried to suck it up instead of aborting to defend? I'd be rolling with a score of 1, so my 2 result would have been a 2-good instead of a 2-great.) (Also, I am rethinking some of the abort rules. More on that later.)</p>
<p>So the next round, you're going to try to smack-talk me, while I'm going give a command to my demon. For your Willpower 4 + 2 rolled-over bonuses, your score is 6. (My willpower is 3.) So we roll: you get 2-great, I get 7-good. You go first, attacking me with the 2-great successes and "I suck it up", rolling a single d10 with a score of 1: 10-good, so you get two smack-talkin' sucesses against me.</p>
