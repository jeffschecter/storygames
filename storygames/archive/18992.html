From what I understand, there appears to be two different ways of leaning on your connections: One where you just go and see one of your connections and basically say anything, and one where you ask about a specific topic. These are apparently treated differently. From the text, the whole process is a bit unclear to me. Could someone perhaps phrase the mechanism differently or otherwise explain how to build the plot map? Thanks a lot!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424250/#Comment_424250" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T11:28:47+00:00" title="November 15, 2013 11:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you asking about the initial setup when people are buying stuff, or once play has started?<br/><br/>When buying things at character creation it's simply a case of "if a player calls in a favor and that NPC is on the map already, draw a line and invent a relationship to something already there. Otherwise put the NPC on the map but don't attach them."<br/><br/>If a PC is talking to a connection about "stuff", the GM rolls a die, consults that NPCs connection table, and puts the result on the map (and draws a line to something that's already there). If the thing you rolled up is already on the map, link it to the NPC you're talking to. <br/><br/>If the PC is instead asking the connection about something specific (instead of just hunting for general information), the only difference is that you don't need to roll and can instead pick a node off the list that makes the most sense. Everything else applies so if you pick something that isn't on the plot map you write it down and connect it to something that's already there, and if it is on the map already you connect it to the NPC whose list you just consulted.<br/><br/>Mechanically you get identical results, just in the case where you're asking about specific information you skip the roll and instead get to pick something.<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/modsr" title="modsr"><img alt="modsr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/modsr">modsr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424308/#Comment_424308" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T19:52:53+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  7:52PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JustinA" title="JustinA"><img alt="JustinA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JustinA">JustinA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424538/#Comment_424538" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T23:24:38+00:00" title="November 20, 2013 11:24PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately, there are really significant errors in that summary. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it's completely wrong in every important way.<br/><br/>There are four circumstances in which you will add information to the plot map:<br/><br/>1) Creating the mission seed<br/>2) When a connection is hit up for a <em>favor</em><br/>3) When a connection is leaned on for a <em>lead</em><br/>4) When a connection is <em>inquiring</em> about a specific node<br/><br/><em>Mission Seed</em>: Randomly determine three nodes using the master table from the transmission.<br/><br/><em>Favors</em>: The first time a connection is asked for a favor, you add the connection to your plot map. The second time the connection is asked for a favor, you connect them to the plot map by selecting a node of your choice. (This happens regardless of whether the favors are being requested during character generation or during runtime.)<br/><br/><em>Leads</em>: If the characters go to a connection to ask for help in a generic way (just fishing for a lead), you roll on that connection's table. If the result isn't on the plot map yet, you add it to the map and connect it to a node of your choice. If the result is already on the plot map, you add it to the map and connect it to the connection being questioned (the connection is involved somehow).<br/><br/><em>Inquiring</em>: If the characters ask a connection about a specific node that's already on the plot map, you follow the EXACT SAME PROCEDURE as you did for leads. The only difference is that you connect the node you generate directly to the node the characters are asking about.<br/><br/>In all circumstances, of course, the GM can simply choose to ignore the random roll and choose the node which makes sense to them.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the rulebook doesn't address one specific scenario: The PCs are inquiring about a specific node and the random roll gives the result of the same node they're asking about. I would recommend, following the general logic of the system, that if this is the result the node they're asking about should be connected to the connection they're talking to (which means they either asked exactly the right guy about it or exactly the wrong guy about it).<br/><br/>The plot map may also be modified during maintenance between sessions, but that's a separate kettle of fish and is mostly just a "use your best discretion" kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424553/#Comment_424553" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T07:54:09+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  7:54AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well nuts, that's what I get for paraphrasing at work.
