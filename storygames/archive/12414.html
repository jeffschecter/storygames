With the market power of their licenses and Cam Banks open-mind to design influences on both sides of the spectrum, I think they are doing a lot to break down artificial cultural divides in the hobby.  I'm very curious to see how extremists on either side will react to games that mix traditional structures with rules that manipulate the story.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
