What I mean by that is the sort of game, not necessarily with a real world time limit (although that could be something to talk about as well) but with more of a built in limit on the amount of scenes in an "adventure" for lack of a better word. <br/><br/>For example, in 3:16, each planet has a certain number of threat tokens, and once you use them the planets over. I'm thinking about something similar to that, but with even more restrictions, along the lines of "each adventure has four combat scenes and three downtime scenes and then it's over, play a second adventure if you want it to go longer" sort of thing. <br/><br/>Thoughts on the upsides/downsides of this sort of thing? Do you totally hate it? Think it's good, but only if used correctly to guide the flow of play in a positive manner? Have any specific thoughts or examples about games that use this kind of thing well? Did you think it added or detracted from the experience while playing those games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201535/#Comment_201535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T12:35:02+00:00" title="April 10, 2009 12:35PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've usually liked this sort of thing when it combined with significant freedoms in other parts to compensate the formulaic structure in this.

Unless each scene has a stated purpose, I could see burning the scenes without getting any closer to resolution.  Would you ritualize it?  Something like *exposition*, *investigation*, *complication*, *revelation*, *crisis*, *aftermath*, for example, ensuring in some way that a story still got told?  It seems easy to constrain the number of scenes, but how would you make sure a story was still told from a metagame perspective?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201550/#Comment_201550" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T15:01:50+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  3:01PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It all depends on how well it's done.

The way I've seen it work is that then it works like a scene budget that gets adapted to player actions, and I like that feeling. I haven't really seen the too much story/not enough scenes or vice versa, I actually prefer having some kind of cap because it insures that the game will have a climax and an ending, something that's no always true with more general structures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201553/#Comment_201553" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T15:11:22+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  3:11PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it for many of the reasons already stated - creating tension, enforcing length of the game, and ability to impose a particular structure from which a story can be built. When you're working with a particular genre from which you can tease a plot arc or story structure, then using that arc or structure as the backbone of your game makes total sense. Burning Empires appears to do an amazing job of this (haven't played yet), and I agree that it really works for 3:16. MLWM's set menu of scenes may be a looser version of this same vibe that reliably creates a type of play experience.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on a heist/caper game called <i>House of Cards</i> that is intended for one shot play. I'm dividing play into four rounds (casing the target, making preparations, grabbing the loot, and the getaway), and each of these rounds consists of a set number of different types of scenes for things like in-character planning, downtime, and conflicts. I'm hoping this will let me produce gameplay with the feel of heist films (fingers crossed as playtesting continues). <br/><br/>So depending upon the subject matter of your game, I think such constraints are an awesome tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201555/#Comment_201555" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T15:14:36+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  3:14PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me too.

Let me reformulate that.<br/><br/>I think constrained scene economies are <em>the best thing evar</em>.<br/><br/>In my experience, players tend to stretch things out unnecessarily, wander incoherently, and simply not use their game-time in an efficient manner.  That is, if you look at a typical unstructured game and itemize the things that the players actually accomplish in terms of story and characterization (or whatever their CA values), a very small portion of time is actually used for what they play for.  Most of the time is groping towards figuring out what they want and how.<br/><br/>The way I design, the purpose of game procedures is to guide players to be more efficient with their time, hitting the notes they need to hit and then ushering them off to the next opportunity.  Procedures that affect scenes do the latter part (usher them off to the next opportunity), while the rest of the game procedures do the first (guide players to hit the right notes).  So in my experience, you really need those note-hitting procedures to complement the scene-ushering procedures.

The playtest feedback so far has been encouraging. Each scenario comes with a fixed number of "acts" (not as constrained as single scenes) of which the first has a fixed setting, with a pre-written "prologue" and a set of "roles" for the PCs which tie them into the prologue and setting. Also, the last "act" is usually contrained in some way, either in setting, or by inclusion of a named important NPC in it or something.<br/>In play, "acts" alternate with "breaks" in which the players are encouraged to discuss the ongoing game out of character.<br/><br/>I've found that I have to very clearly explain the constrained structure to my fellow players before the game, insuring everybody got it just right. But as soon as they get it, they move with it and consciously drive the fiction toward a fulfilling ending. Lots of workshopping happen in the "breaks", but it never devolves into pure pre-scripting of scenes.<br/><br/>This somehow resembles playing Geiger Counter: people need to know what the structure <i>is </i>and also need to understand <b>they're responsible for their own fun</b>. Then they cooperate to get maximum enjoyment within the limits of the structure, and the structure does not kick them in the balls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201595/#Comment_201595" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T05:56:05+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  5:56AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tightly structured games fit into a different mental space with me.

IMO, tight scene structures and economies change play in a rather significant way, and it'll catch you off-guard if you're unprepared for that.<br/><br/>The way I see it, a lot of RPGs---particularly indie games---have evolved around what might be called "emergent" play. That is, all significant play elements are either created or defined through play itself. And the thing is, this process can't really be rushed or forced. If it is, then play often feels unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Pre-defining play elements---like pacing or the structure of scenes---thus changes the focus of play. Considering the extremes, I think it changes play from a "pure creation" process to a more interpretative or adaptive process (again, that would be considering extreme cases)... Hmm, I'm not sure that's actually the best way to expresses my thoughts, but hopefully you get my point. The main thing is just that it changes play toward something different than the "default" mode players might be used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201627/#Comment_201627" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T16:42:24+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  4:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene constraints are not the only type of time pressure constraints that can be leveraged as part of design.

With tightly constrained games it's even more important that the mechanics have the right "feel" to them (something more than just determining success or failure) and how they're represented.<br/><br/>Take a countdown, for example. A game could just have a limited number of scenes and declare it over once they're done. That's fine if the countdown isn't the point of the game. Another way of doing it is to move a pawn along a track, so everyone can see that there is a time passing. A stack of cards running down throughout the game gives an even stronger visual cue as to time running out. For a lot of tension, use the same stack of cards running down, but have them run down extra-fast and have the players fight a losing battle to add cards to the pile to keep them from running out.<br/><br/>Along the same vein, risk is evoked by gambling, but it is made better by having a concrete representation of what is being risked (e.g. chips), rather than points recorded on a sheet.<br/><br/>It's not just representation, the process of it matters. For example, being able to save dice from one roll to the next gives a sense of building something, and possibly sacrifice for a greater goal.<br/><br/>Sure, all these things are doable in a larger game, but tightly constrained games are often very good at focusing on one particular "feel," so you can really go wild in expressing that in the mechanics, promoting one behaviour in the story and discouraging others in ways that games with wider scopes can't get away with so easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201632/#Comment_201632" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T18:10:41+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  6:10PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>Whiteknife, since you seem to be interested, I'll expand a bit on what I said. <br/></blockquote>\nThat's a very good point you make there. The representation is a good idea. <br/><br/>Regardless, I'm starting to think that for what I specifically had in mind I'd be better off with a suggested structure rather than a tight limit. I'm talking about something more along the lines of "investigation scene&gt;&gt;run in with bad guys&gt;&gt;more evidence&gt;&gt;fight with a criminal" or maybe even "Due to the amount of healing surges available, you should do roughly 4 encounters per day then rest" rather than something like "there are 10 scenes then it's over" or "There are four scenes each about one of the elements and then a final showdown"<br/><br/>I think that for what I'm trying to accomplish (basically, an adventure structure for a particular genre) would be better served by a guideline rather than a strict limit. Although then again, maybe a hard limit would drive people to get stuff done quickly? <br/><br/>So, I guess I'll pose a new question: would you rather have a suggested story structure that you're suggested to follow but can be deviated from, or would you rather have a strict limit enforced with relevant mechanics?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201635/#Comment_201635" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T18:36:57+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  6:36PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>So, I guess I'll pose a new question: would you rather have a suggested story structure that you're suggested to follow but can be deviated from, or would you rather have a strict limit enforced with relevant mechanics?</blockquote>\nFrom what you describe, it seems like the suggestive method would be better. There are a lot of games out there that don't make particular plots mandatory, but effectively make them the most fun (and supported by mechanics) way to play. D&amp;D is a classic example, but the one that always sticks in my mind is always Shadowrun. Sure, it has a whole world built for it, and nothing says you can't do other things, but you still go on its version of dungeon crawls anyways because so much of what is in the mechanics, equipment lists, npcs, etc. are focused on trying to make that activity fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201637/#Comment_201637" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T19:08:00+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  7:08PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually use a real world time limit.

The players are drawing each others attention to the adventure.<br/>And it really doesn't help if a combat round lasts for 15 minutes, it was best working for me in rules light systems (FATE) or when a session was long enough (in the Star Wars adventure Traitor's Gambit the PCs set the timer of the bomb in real-time).<br/><br/>I'm totally thinking about utilizing something like this ruleswise.<br/><br/>Oh, I just remembered that I was working on an RPG called Planet X.

To restate my actual point without even that unintentional air of dismissal of his experience: I think that his group is better at endogenously formulating a direction for their game than mine, and thus benefits less than groups like mine from mechanical channels for their storytelling.  To the extent that a group tends to lose story focus, they probably benefit from constraints like time limits (Puppetland, Fiasco), a list of allowed moves for the GM (Dogs) and/or all players (Storming the Wizard's Tower is inspiring in this regard),  or a reward cycle centered on story goals (TSoY, WoD).<br/><br/>Given my group's tendency to wander about in the weeds, I am thinking about Storming the Puppetland of Darkness, Yesterday.

I was thinking about how fast the planet should get stronger, but I never had the chance to test it.</blockquote>\n<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Zombie</span>Planet X Cinema.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogo" rel="nofollow"><i>Mogo doesn't socialize?</i></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201824/#Comment_201824" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T13:17:44+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  1:17PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should note that many stories have extremely tightly structured beginnings, middles and endings - watch a TV sitcom, for example, or read a romance novel.

Not only fictional series, but even talk shows or comedy shows, anything that's on TV is tightly structured. Except maybe Monthy Python's Flying Circus.<br/><br/>And I know  I always drop this in every existing thread I post in, but if you want a structured narrative, than read Propp's  Morphology of the Folk Tale. A rules set to write folk tales. George Lucas used it to write the original Star Wars movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
