The idea was to give the person what they need to know to continue forward with the game and the tools to find out more if they want. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Any who without further ado the intro (which is exactly one page size in the booklet) any critics and opinions would be super! The first booklet will be Transhuman ~ Disco I will try to keep people posted.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntro<br/>\n<br/>\n  This booklet is a complete Story Game freely published by   Odds-Are, and sponsored by fans and companies of the Story Game movement. We hope that by putting these booklets out there we can bring the enjoyment of our hobby to you! <br/>\n  We ask that if upon you and a few friends or family members playing this game you do not enjoy it, you please kindly place it back in a public place for some one else to find. Weather you do or do not like this game we also suggest that you visit             Odds-Are.com/storywhat to see if one of our many other free games might appeal to you!<br/>\n<br/>\nStory What?<br/>\n<br/>\n  A Story Game (some times called a role playing game) is very simply any game in which narrative control of the game is used as a key element of play. Quite simply it is a bunch of people kicking back and in a very casual manner developing stories based around some core rules to guide the direction of play. The best part about Story Games though is that they are truly equalizers; you don\u2019t need to be funny, or strong, or smart to play a Story Game just willing to have some creative fun!<br/>\n  Story Games also have the added benefit of nigh infinite replay ability unlike video games whose repetitive plots become tiresome and give far less bang for your buck. With a Story Game you and your friends can sit down brining new energy to a game time and time again and the system will not fail to funnel your creativity into something awesome.<br/>\n  Aside from a great gaming experience the various communities of Story Gamers both on and offline is a phenomenal group of people. For more information on where Story Gamers are check out Odds-Are.com/storywhere to get linked up to some incredibly active groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nTools of the trade<br/>\n<br/>\n    One of the greatest aspects of Story Games is no matter what game system you play the controllers are all pretty much the same. Pen and paper, as well as dice are usually enough to get you by. Some games use a pack of cards instead of dice for this game you can use either a pack of cards or a hand full of any type of dice.<br/>\n[Edit: stupid spelling mix up fixed]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232775/#Comment_232775" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T05:53:36+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  5:53AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh don't go to my website there is nothing there yet!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232779/#Comment_232779" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T06:34:04+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  6:34AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "... very simply any game in which narrative control of the game is used as a key element of play"<br/><br/>That doesn't sound very simple at all to me.

Instead of growing old and watching all my gaming buddies trickle away I think it would be cool to have a healthy growing community of gamers. It is like my personal blue ocean that I would like to try and tackle, instead of trying to focus on jumping into a crowded market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232893/#Comment_232893" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T15:26:07+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  3:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rock on.

The reason Lady Blackbird works so well is that it relies very heavily on genre tropes that most of us geeky gamer types are familar with..."steam punkish swashbucklers in flying ships?  Great!"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me, however, that if you are looking for a intro for the general public you might want to hack the Lady Blackbird mechanics onto something more mainstream familiar...like Archaeological Adventure ala Indiana Jones, The Mummy, or The Da Vinci Code.
