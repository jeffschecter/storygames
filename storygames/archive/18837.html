While historically, for example, people have assumed that women of a certain status will be Ladies and therefore they will be x and do y, anyone can be x and do y. Men can be nurturers. Women can be warriors. The way Rookvale does it is acknowledge that these roles exist, but they aren't tied down. So my male coal miner can be a Lady at times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421924/#Comment_421924" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T09:49:03+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  9:49AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a terrible person and Joe should never play test with me.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421936/#Comment_421936" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T11:44:48+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 11:44AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think gender in Rookvale is kind of filling a niche that "race" (as in, nonhuman species) fills in a lot of other games \u2013 both a character descriptor and a unique mechanical bonus.

The six genders of Rookvale is a playful injection of radical politics.<br/><br/>Why are there not just the two genders you're familiar with? Because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we don't live in a world with two fixed genders</span>, despite what cultural hegemons tell us. We live in a world where people have complicated relationships to masculinity, femininity, and gender. We live in a world with intersex people, <a href="http://femfreq.tumblr.com/post/57753367631/buzzfeed-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about" rel="nofollow">transgender</a> people, non-binary genders, gender rebels, and evolving patterns of gender resistance. Our relationships to gender are prone to change. <a href="http://tranarchism.com/2010/11/26/not-your-moms-trans-101/" rel="nofollow">Gender is weird</a> and the people who tell you otherwise probably have an oppressive agenda.<br/><br/>This stuff matters to me, as a queer genderqueer trying to sort out their relationship to hegemonic culture.<br/><br/>And so Rookvale is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer" rel="nofollow">genderqueer</a> place. People change genders. There are lots of different, evolving gender identities. Some are treated with hostility and ostracism in some areas (because inserting queer politics into your game doesn't mean you need to treat queer people gently), there are weird rules about what you are and aren't allowed to talk about in mixed company.<br/><br/>So mechanically, Genders in Rookvale are just a way to group a set of six passive powers. They are a direct equivalent to Passions in Anima Prime (the parent game). You pick a Gender for your character and boom, you get a cool power that helps you earn Charge dice or whatever.<br/><br/>And story-wise, it's saying "Rookvale is a weird, queer place that's worth exploring between your battles. What's a Monast? How does a Monast dress? What would it mean to transition from being a Monast to being a Lady after a particularly harrowing fight?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421942/#Comment_421942" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T12:40:02+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 12:40PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm a terrible person and Joe should never play test with me. </blockquote>\nYeah but I told him to do this, too, and I'm a genius.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421944/#Comment_421944" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T12:45:08+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 12:45PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah but I told him to do this, too, and I'm a genius.</blockquote>\nIt was a terrible idea when Orlando said it, but a brilliant idea when you said it twenty seconds later.

"Jack", to me anyway, would suggest a knave or a rogue (what do you call/associate with the card that comes after 10 in a deck of cards? The "hero" who slayed the giant after climbing a magic beanstalk?): but that's even more widely open to interpretation.<br/><br/>Mug? Well, I guess there might be a transatlantic divide over that one: <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mug" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mug</a> - I guess this would be a thug or "heavy" in this context, as opposed to an idiot.<br/><br/>Tinder? I'd have to think about that. By tinder I understand something like kindling; something dry and combustible that you use to light a fire. So, maybe someone who is quick to start a fight?<br/><br/>Monast? Even less clear. It isn't an English word. I'd guess it would be a monk (as in monastery), ascetic or Jedi.<br/><br/>Hopefully that's some kind of help and at least gets you started, but I'm guessing the point is to explore the meaning of these yourself.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421981/#Comment_421981" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T17:30:08+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  5:30PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the caveat that I'm doing a lot of projecting here, I would venture to say....<br/><br/>"Mug" to me suggests a tough guy, maybe a soldier or a warrior. Someone who's had their nose broke a couple of times, or took a scar. So they have an "ugly mug." (It's an old slang term for "face", like when the police take mug shots.)<br/><br/>"Jack" is maybe a jack-of-all-trades, or a knave? It's what we call playing cards with faces that aren't the king or the queen. (I think it's called "fante" in Italian?) The oldest connotations involve being a faithful servant, but the modern connotation has a little bit of a roguishness to it. Maybe it's someone who is not the leader but knows how to get things done behind the scenes, maybe through a little charm and guile.<br/><br/>"Tinder" is a total cipher to me.

But I don't really get how gender is supposed to work.  Does anyone get what's going on there?</blockquote>\nFighting adventure games usually have regressive politics. The six genders of Rookvale is a playful injection of radical politics.<br/><br/>Why are there not just the two genders you're familiar with? Because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we don't live in a world with two fixed genders</span>, despite what cultural hegemons tell us. We live in a world where people have complicated relationships to masculinity, femininity, and gender. We live in a world with intersex people, <a href="http://femfreq.tumblr.com/post/57753367631/buzzfeed-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about" rel="nofollow">transgender</a> people, non-binary genders, gender rebels, and evolving patterns of gender resistance. Our relationships to gender are prone to change. Gender is weird and the people who tell you otherwise probably have an oppressive agenda.<br/><br/>This stuff matters to me, as a queer genderqueer trying to sort out their relationship to hegemonic culture.<br/><br/>And so Rookvale is a genderqueer place. People change genders. There are lots of different, evolving gender identities. Some are treated with hostility and ostracism in some areas (because inserting queer politics into your game doesn't mean you need to treat queer people gently), there are weird rules about what you are and aren't allowed to talk about in mixed company.<br/><br/>So mechanically, Genders in Rookvale are just a way to group a set of six passive powers. They are a direct equivalent to Passions in Anima Prime (the parent game). You pick a Gender for your character and boom, you get a cool power that helps you earn Charge dice or whatever.<br/><br/>And story-wise, it's saying "Rookvale is a weird, queer place that's worth exploring between your battles. What's a Monast? How does a Monast dress? What would it mean to transition from being a Monast to being a Lady after a particularly harrowing fight?"</blockquote>Let me clarify.  When I say "I don't get how gender is supposed to work", I don't mean "I don't get why Joe is including this gender mechanic".  That bit I do get, and is one of the reasons I think the game is cool.  What I didn't get is what I'm supposed to make out of the words Lady, Father, Mug, Monast, Jack, and Tinder.<br/><br/>I feel like I'd be more comfortable having more to start with (The bits about Ladies ruling and Tinders not being welcomed in one province is a good example of what I'd like more of).  Finding out through play is cool, but players will be picking gender at character creation.  Half my players don't like playing characters of another gender.  I'd certainly not want to have them discover through play that the character is of a gender that the player is not comfortable with*.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm really looking for is something that I as GM can say is true of various genders when the game begins.  Obviously I could make it all up, but that feels a bit cheating.  Some of the other replies on this thread might make some good starting points.  Joe, if you're willing to explain why you chose the genders you did, or how they turned out in the games you've played, that would be valuable<br/><br/><br/>*The character is of a gender that the character is not comfortable with is a different story.

The point, as I understand it anyway, is not that you get to play a "male" lady or a "female" mug, but that you are a lady or mug.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Rookvale rules (as far as I can tell), is completely silent when it comes to sex and sexuality. If that's important to you, then maybe you should discuss that with your group first. Rookvale is a fantasy world, so it could be there are two sexes or it could be everyone is a hermaphrodite; or there could be some completely different biology going on. I would have thought that any of these options are fine. The only thing the rules state is that gender itself is fluid and that characters can change gender throughout the game.<br/><br/>The question is though, do you need to bring sex or sexuality into the game? Either answer is fine, but I don't think you should assume that really needs to be nailed down. This isn't Monsterhearts; there are no sex moves.<br/><br/>It's something you need to discuss with your group before, during and after the game. It's a different frame of reference that is a major aspect of the game. It's worth chewing over because, frankly, it's interesting. It certainly isn't a game you can just throw down at the table and get on with it without ensuring everyone is on the same page first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422132/#Comment_422132" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T20:39:09+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  8:39PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I guess what I'm really looking for is something that I as GM can say is true of various genders when the game begins.

Those concerns are really valid.<br/><br/>Semajmaharg is right - there's no such thing as a tinder and you don't need to worry about offending fictional characters. But at the same time, you're on to something - games are a training ground for the way we look at the world, and it's important to not be patronizing and disrespectful in the stories we tell (because those stories will inform our worldview moving forward).<br/><br/>So, let's explore what those six genders might be like, a little bit -\n<blockquote>possible connotations that come to mind:<br/><br/>*Monast = monastery = monk/nun<br/>*Tinder is a word that means little sticks that you burn.  So is faggot.<br/>*Tinder could also be a shortened form of Transgender.  Which isn't much help, because "Transgender" isn't a gender, and people in rookvale seem to change genders freely so it's also not likely to be a useful description for a specific set of people.<br/>*Father and Lady both correspond to our standard gender binary.  They both also connote a certain level of maturity.<br/>*Jack is also strongly male-aligned, at least to me.  See for example: Jack and Jill, Jackass.<br/>*Mug is the one that I've got nothing for.  Drinking Vessel, Face, Robbery.  None of them seem to relate to traits that I'd connect to gender.</blockquote>\nMonast was indeed inspired by the words <i>monastery</i> and <i>monastic</i>. Their special power is all about recovering dice and maintaining their Charge even when there is failure. So I'm imagining Monasts as being reliable and non-reactive. Monasts are the lovers who are there for you when you need them.<br/><br/>Tinder is a type of fire-starter. So maybe tinders are passionate, impulsive, reactive. There's a picture of a tinder in the book, on page 4 (Jesse, the example PC). There's two figures behind the tinder, and my guess might be that they're a lady (in scarlet) and a monast (in white). The tinder special power is all about power and lashing out, or alternately you could look at it as being all about gaining momentum (when a tinder is up, they're up).<br/><br/>You suggest that Father and Lady both correspond to a standard gender binary. I think that's fair, but I want to point out that Father/Lady aren't parallel. In our world: Father is the intersection of masculine traits and parenthood, whereas Lady is the intersection of feminine traits and being upper class. In Rookvale: that may well be true, but "masculine" and "feminine" aren't words they'd even have, so they'd describe it differently.<br/><br/>Fathers have a special power that's all about being protective. When someone else gets hit, or you intervene and take the hit for them, you get a boost toward avenging that hit. Fathers sound loyal and protective and maybe also controlling of those around them.<br/><br/>Ladies have a power that's all about inspiring those around them. Ladies tend to rule over Rookvale. Ladies sound like born leaders, inspiring people. Lady also carries strong connotations of high status and high society for me. I'm imagining that when a lady strolls into battle, they look composed. When a lady climbs into bed with someone, they're assertive but attentive.<br/><br/>Jack being "strongly male-aligned" isn't an important observation, because "male" isn't really a thing in Rookvale. Jacks have a special power that's about helping their friends and contributing to Big Epic Achievements. In my mind Jacks are attentive and helpful and born followers, but also people who crave adventure and excitement. If a jack was told "this might be dangerous," I imagine that a big smile would start to creep across their face.<br/><br/>Mug is an old slang word meaning "face," and for me it connotes a grizzled butch face. I envisioned Mugs being tough folk who're rough around the edges. Many mugs would be proud of their scars. Some of the mugs who got pregnant would view their pregnancy as a triumph of blood and endurance, a battle against their own limits.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>More important than any specific shared traits, it's important to have characters feel like individuals. So when you introduce tinders, don't make them all the same. Make them recognizably tinder, sure, but make them all individuals with their own personal eccentricities and oddities.<br/><br/>If it's helpful to consider media characters, here are some on-the-fly breakdowns of popular characters and what Rookvale gender I imagine them having -<br/><br/>Harry Potter - lady<br/>Hermoine Granger - monast<br/>Ron Weasley - jack<br/><br/>Batman - father<br/>Robin - jack<br/>Catwoman - tinder<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker - monast or jack<br/>Princess Leia - lady<br/>Han Solo - mug<br/>Chewbacca - mug or father<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>So, those are some non-canon extrapolations about what the genders might be like. When you put out the gender cards, you could say that stuff. If folks ask more questions about the genders, you could just shrug and forward the question to someone else in the group. If your players don't like that style of free-wheeling world-building, then you're welcome to instead make up whatever answers you come up with. Your answers will be Totally Right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mark.argent" title="mark.argent"><img alt="mark.argent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/872/nZNDGHV70MCN5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mark.argent">mark.argent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422178/#Comment_422178" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T01:07:19+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  1:07AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On the other hand, the Rookvale rules (as far as I can tell), is completely silent when it comes to sex and sexuality.

You can designate them he/she as you see fit, or use they, or create a bunch of weird pronouns (lee, fee, ti, mug, mo, and jae?).

Achievements are described on page 10. There is also a summary card dedicated to Achievements.<br/><br/>Binding a demon is an Achievement with a difficulty equal to its <i>current Hubris + current Wounds + current Defense</i>. Summoning a demon is an Achievement with a difficulty equal to its <i>full Defense</i>. Commanding a demon is an Achievement with a difficulty equal to its <i>current Hubris</i> (which starts at 0 after a summoning). Each time you successfully command a demon, its Hubris goes up by 2. This is all described on page 13.<br/><br/>A demon can be commanded once per round. If at the end of the round it hasn't been commanded, it does a Maneuver with its best skill and maximum possible number of Action dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424932/#Comment_424932" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T15:36:11+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  3:36PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424933/#Comment_424933" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T15:52:49+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  3:52PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would probably just use the english names in play but if I had to go for a german translation I would go with.<br/>Lady = Dame (Which means lady as the title but is also used for queens, in the playing card)<br/>Father = Vater (1:1 translation)<br/>Monast = Monast (With a slightly different pronounciation probably, but a monastic lifestyle is called "monastisch" in German, so that still works)<br/>Tinder = Zunder (same root word again and also meaning something that can accelerate a fire as well as burst into flames easily)<br/>Jack = Bube (The playing card is called a Bube and it has a youthful connotation as well and a knave could be called a Spitzbube, so I think it comes close)<br/>Mug = Fratze (This one is not easy.

Our relationships to gender are prone to change. Gender is weird and the people who tell you otherwise probably have an oppressive agenda.</blockquote>\nExcept that some individuals in some of the sets you listed above are pretty dysphoric and probably not all that stoked about sitting down at a table with primarily cis-identified players <b>stomping around in what could potentially become a china shop of hot buttons</b>.<br/>I\u2019ve dated in the past:<br/>a transman,<br/>a transwoman,<br/>someone who was more blurred, but identified as femme-punk with some genderqueer elements,<br/>a cis hetero man,<br/>and a cis femme lesbian woman.<br/><br/>(Apparently, I am a bi woman, given the company I keep\u2026)<br/><br/>I believe that the latter two, and I guess the middle one also, would think this game would rock.

But I also think that they would not want to speak up themselves, for fear of outing themselves. It can be a pretty frustrating topic.

Sure, people with disabilities are not any less (or more) capable than anyone else, but if the focus of the game becomes how fun it is to pretend to be blind or missing a leg or cognitively impaired, it may raise some questions among people with disabilities.<br/><br/>It could also be a valuable learning tool -- but that risks the problem of being a game only focused on the able-bodied, doesn't it? Because PWDs don't need to learn what it's like to be disabled. Focusing the game on temporarily non-disabled players and their experiences with fictionalized disability could be seen as exclusionary to PWDs.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425139/#Comment_425139" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T13:15:08+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  1:15PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting point 2097.

I agree that there is a potential quagmire in introducing complicated discussions of gender at the table, especially when that table includes people with marginalized bodies/identities.<br/><br/>Personally, I spend a lot of energy dealing with dysphoria, and thinking about gender violence. I'm genderqueer and queer. I identify as being in that dysphoric and tangled situation myself. Rookvale presents gender as a fluid, non-binary thing. The text hints that lots of things are controversial and dangerous in Rookvale, but gender self-identification isn't really one of them (with noted exceptions - Tinder are regarded with suspicion in some places).<br/><br/>I wanted a fantasy game that wasn't mired in misogyny and transmisogyny. And so I wrote my best attempt at that. Rookvale is a setting that manages to be both genderfluid and matriarchal, to have serious problems but be progressive and worth saving. When you sit down to play, you don't really discuss gender much. But the very first task in character creation reinforces the fact that this is a world where I am welcome and bigots aren't, because I'm tired of fantasy worlds positing the reverse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425373/#Comment_425373" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T05:23:39+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  5:23AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the web page for this particular game was down when I made the post.
