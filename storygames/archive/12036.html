Players are Marcus from Norway, Daniel from Sweden, and Raffaele from Italy. None of us are native English speakers. <br/><br/>We start out by saying hi, getting to know each other by name, discussing briefly what sort of "gamers" we are - tabletop or larp? Then I explain the rules a bit more, we do the opening banishing and visioning rituals, and then we start generating characters.<br/><br/>I become a woman who's in her second marriage; she used to be Italian gentry, but has left the country. Very emancipated woman.<br/>Raffaele is a middle-aged Hungarian physician. <br/>Daniel is a slightly older Russian scientist.<br/>Marcus is a former monk from Chile, a playboy. His age card says "much too young". <br/><br/>Our childhood scenes:<br/>- The scientist: He's standing alone in his parent's house, looking at the paintings. His parents are dead, killed in the revolution. A friend of his father comes in. A large man, with a huge beard. He grabs the child's face and forces it upwards. "You will be my apprentice!" <br/>- The monk: He's playing outside on a dusty road, with his gang and little brother. An old gypsy rides his cart into the village. The gypsy asks for the boy's grandfather. "I owe him something!" The child sees his grandfather standing outside the church. "I'll tell you where he is if you give me 100 pesetas!" The gypsy mumbles angrily, hands over the money. The child points him in the wrong direction, then runs. The money turns to old paper in his hands. <br/>- The woman: There's shooting outside, and mother is looking scared. "Hurry!" They go to mother's bedroom. The child hides under the table; mother closes the shutters, cries. There are people in the courtyard. Mother goes into the other room, picks up a gun and kills herself. The child cries under the table.<br/>- The physician: Father is putting on his uniform. He's going to war. The child wears daddy's uniform hat. The father tells him to look after his mother while he's gone. "She's very ill, remember that." That night, when the child lies in bed, he sees visions of twisting snakes on the ceiling. Two snakes. What are they doing?<br/><br/>Youth scenes:<br/>- The scientist: He drags a dead man into the master's laboratory. The body has a huge hole in the head, the brain is missing. The master shouts at him, sends him out to get a new body. He meets an old milk farmer - and is struck by lightning. When he wakes, the farmer's daughter is taking care of him.<br/>- The monk: He comes back to the village, head shaven. Carmencita, a younger girl, is there. She teases him, tells him he didn't use to be so coy. "Meet me behind the barn tonight!" He doesn't go there. That night, he dreams of her in a dress covered in blood. When he wakes, he leaves the monastery.<br/>- The woman: She's showing her first painting to her first husband, a rich and jaded amateur. It's brilliant, but she doesn't know. He scoffs, makes her throw it on the fire. "But take off the frame first, I'll need it". As she leaves the room, he stares at the fire where _something_ comes out of the burning canvas.<br/>- The physician: Mother's being buried. Father is drunk, his legs ruined by the war. The young man tells his father: "I... I'm not joining the armed forces. I want an education, father." The father says it's the best thing he ever heard, then unleashes all his pain and cynicism, drunkenly. As the son cries, he sees two black snakes making patterns on his mother's coffin. He doesn't understand. He has to understand!<br/><br/>After this, the game proper began. The themes of the snakes, the white dress and the paintings reappeared many times; sometimes based on reincorporating cards, often spontaneously.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the game, the Society was living in a flat in Berlin with the windows boarded up, filled with paintings - obsessive variations on patterns of intertwinings snakes. The physician had a black stone in his chest, stolen from a dying black man's dream, forced there by the monk while he was possessed. <br/><br/>The game starts out by spreading mystery, then degenerates - or, rather, is there a word for going deeper down into a chaos woven by threads of imagery and half-understood metaphor? We had the best session ever (at least for me) of wine, insanity, art and dreams. <br/><br/>I love these sessions where you feel like you get to know new people on a strange level - not what they do in their daily lives, not how they talk, but how they think, how they dream, what they see in their heads. How they perceive the world and their magic. At the same time, what we really know is how the _group_ sees things, together.<br/><br/>We did no debriefing after the game. This was a game that left at least me in a different state of mind, and I saw no need to force the dreamer to resurface at that point.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269402/#Comment_269402" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T03:32:08+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  3:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good!

I don't recall who was there besides Lapo himself and young Norwegian "Miss Knutpunkt" Frida-Sofie).<br/><br/>As soon as you'll feel like sharing a draft of the game, I'd like to run it with my Italian forgehead friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_269528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269528/#Comment_269528" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T00:23:39+00:00" title="April 30, 2010 12:23AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good, Matthijs! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269548/#Comment_269548" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T07:51:50+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  7:51AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this sounds really fun.
