Are you asking for a perfect setting from the perspective of a single character within that setting, or from the perspective of the entire game world as a whole?<br/><br/>When it comes to RPGs, I've always loved games with fully-developed, multifaceted settings that can be played from a multitude of angles.  For example, the setting for White Wolf's Aeon/Trinity had a variety of different ways in which it could be explored: the PCs could be a military strike force (sanctioned or otherwise), secret agents for world governments, investigators, hackers, freedom fighters, doctors, diplomats, etc.  The feel of the game could be anything from hardcore beat-em-up to murder mystery.  The locations included a fascist North America dominated by giant arcologies, a post-apocalyptic European wasteland, a xenophobic Japan, mafia-controlled South America, and a shining, quickly-developing Australia.  Throw in lunar colonies (some high-class, others slums), and extrasolar colonies that have been out of contact for decades, and you've got an almost unlimited choice as to how to play the game.  And I'm the type of person who would love to explore all the different elements of that setting.  The genius part? This was detailed in the core book, albeit at a high level.<br/><br/>From a personal perspective, I'd probably say something similar.  To narrow it down to a personal perspective: some sort of cyberpunk setting, with rogue AIs, giant mega-corporations, instant access to data, secrets and mysteries and conspiracies, with a little bit of grunge and grime thrown in.  Sexy razorgirls, augmented cyborgs, jacked-in hackers, and high-class decadents who indulge in technology for fun and leisure.  Ideally, the whole thing would have a bit of film noir feel to it.  My character would definitely be someone who has to struggle, in some capacity, to survive: eking out a living doing odd hacking jobs, security details, private investigation, etc.  He probably ends up thrust into a situation which is above and beyond his understanding.  Seemingly unconnected elements all connect together to form a larger, and incomprehensible whole, and my character has to deal with working out what's going on, and decided whether or not he wants to affect the outcome (if he even can).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196672/#Comment_196672" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T12:06:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2009 12:06PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a dystopian future setting, slightly sci-fi, slightly Paranoia, very 1984.

When I answered the questions I was mentally appending the conditions "as a player" and "right now" to them. Our tastes probably shift over time, and it may be that what we want to play is different from what we want to GM. Might almost be worth a thread exploring that contrast, if there is one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196826/#Comment_196826" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T10:37:00+00:00" title="March 13, 2009 10:37AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are the same reasons I'm attracted to the GM position.<br/><br/>Definitely feel free to answer the questions with the appended conditions "as a player" and "right now".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196833/#Comment_196833" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T11:02:13+00:00" title="March 13, 2009 11:02AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Warren Ellis style supers game where players are the god-level characters who fight other god-level characters.

There's FTL travel, say, or subtle ritual magic that allows special healing. There's not a unicorn in every garage. It's a game about people, so nothing exists that can distract from that. "I want to play an intelligent ceiling tile" does not apply.<br/><br/>There's a budding sense of urgency--a larger quest that must be resolved. It doesn't consume the characters, but it provides motivation, and it's go-to material for both players and GM. It's like exercising. You don't have to do it every minute of every day, but putting it off has consequences. It's a thing that basically all characters want to see resolved, unless they're psychotic.<br/><br/>The characters are all sympathetic. They might do bad things, but you have reasons to care about them.<br/><br/>The characters have complex relationships in that their motivations draw them together and pull them apart.<br/><br/>Your choices in play impact the setting. Things change because of what you do. Cities prosper, children get sick, Jason Morningstar becomes CEO of Proctor &amp; Gamble. Be careful.<br/><br/> As in Star Trek, gadgets only get you so far. You have to use the Mk. 1 noggin to get you out of trouble.

Undercurrent of something's not quite right.  The character(s) have that feeling and need to find it out.  They are 'outsiders' in the sense that they know something everyone else does not know or doesn't care to know.  Big Brother or Benefactor is in place and wants to stay there.  The characters actions could jeapordize the entire culture if successful.  But there's danger of 'disappearing' or some such.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo swing the pendulum in another direction I would like to play a Operator 5 setting.   America invaded,  stout hearted men and women battling to save their land and lives and families.  I could go with a true Operator 5 setting or do the Red Dawn thing or War of The Worlds type.
