We had four players this time (two new to Danger Patrol, two veterans) and while it was lots of fun as always, we hit that same thing as before where once things got really, dare I say, dangerous, things slowed down a lot. At least more than seemed fitting for fast-paced action.<br/><br/>Strolling the late night streets of Indianapolis in search of food, we did some quick brainstorming and re-wrote the game without powers. When we continued the game the next day, we tried it out.<br/><br/><br/><b>POWER-FREE DANGER PATROL</b><br/>First off, ignore all the powers and special style/role bonuses on your character sheet. All you have left are your style &amp; role, your skills, your equipment, and your injury/danger meter track. You can use power tokens do one of four things:<br/><br/><b>Add Style/Role Bonus (1 power)</b> -- When you take an action, describe how you use the special abilities of your Style or Role to help. Add 2 bonus dice to your roll.<br/><br/> <i>Example:</i> Gloor'ulo-loop, frog-xplorer of Venus (Alien/Explorer), is sneaking through the sacred temple to steal the holy urn of the xenophobic Mercurian priesthood. It's an Agent check, so the player spends a power token and describes how as an Explorer he knows the rituals of the ancient cult and can anticipate where the priests will be. He rolls Agent + 2 bonus dice, plus danger.<br/> <br/> <i>Example:</i> Rik Rocket, Mystic Flyboy, is defusing a bomb. It's a Professor check. The player spends a power token to do a Mystic move, and describes letting the spirits guide his hand, listening to his feelings Luke, etc. as he decides whether to cut the blue or red wire. He rolls Professor + 2 bonus dice, plus whatever danger he adds.<br/> <br/>As the examples show, the cool move can apply to any check, so long as you explain how your Style/Role helps you. A Role maneuver does not have to help your role skill: an Explorer could help his flyboy check because he was familiar with the strange winds of the planet, etc.<br/><br/><b>Take Another Action (2 power)</b> -- Take an extra turn at any point in the round (same as original rules)<br/><br/><b>Reduce Damage (2 power)</b> -- Check a reduced box when you take a full hit, or negate a reduced hit. You can use it twice to negate a full hit. (same as original rules)<br/><br/><b>Take Another Interlude (1 power)</b> -- Take another full Interlude scene. If you want to heal injuries, you must also lower your danger (it's unclear if you have to do both in the original rules, but with multiple interludes the two should be tied together).<br/><br/>We actually played it with "Take Another Action" only costing 1 power, but 2 is probably better to make the style/role move valuable.<br/><br/><br/><b>HOW DID IT WORK?</b><br/>From the limited testing of one session, I'd say it worked pretty well. The advantage is that you focus more on coming up with cool descriptions of what you do, and less on figuring out how to work the crunch.<br/><br/><br/><b>OTHER RULE CHANGES</b><br/>We were also playtesting <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=221027" rel="nofollow">other rule changes</a> even before we tried the power-free method:<br/><br/>- roll double skill dice in KO bracket, triple skill dice in Vaporize bracket<br/>- injury is just like stun (lasts one action)<br/>- threat move 1 puts a point of danger on the threat, not a die<br/><br/>- defense powers reduce instead of negate<br/>- attack powers do 2 hits [simple solution for now, might change later]<br/>- remove two-fisted bloodied (keep big damn hero)<br/>- bonus die powers get 2 bonus dice<br/><br/>The first set still apply even without powers, but the second are moot without powers.<br/><br/>I'd say all the changes worked well. An interesting side effect of the x2/x3 skill dice at the high end of the danger meter is that characters are less dependent on danger dice, and if they play their cards right they're rolling more bigger dice instead of smaller dice, which makes the high end more survivable -- you can dance on the brink of disaster. It also invites players to up the stakes and get into the higher brackets, which is cool.<br/><br/>I'd also lean towards reducing the amount of equipment. Right now there are 4 role eq, 1 gun, and 4 generic. That's a lot of bonus dice if you just burn through them. I'd collapse the standard danger patrol eq into 1 die, making it 6 total. Or collapse danger patrol gear into 2 and role gear into 2, for 5 total. That makes the bonus dice you get from the style/role move more relevant.<br/><br/>There's also a whole void for helping other characters that could be addressed.<br/><br/><br/><b>SPIKING THE DANGER METER</b><br/>If you get rid of powers, what's the bonus for spiking the danger meter? One argument is that you don't need a reward at all, because being in the top bracket gives you 3x skill dice and makes you hell on wheels. But if you did want rewards and progression a few options spring to mind:<br/><br/>One option is to raise a skill die when you spike the meter, but I don't really like this idea.<br/><br/>A better option is when a character spikes the danger meter, they earn an additional starting power token at the beginning of each game. So instead of just starting with whatever power you had at the end of the last session, you would always add one more. Spike the meter more, get more starting tokens. A badass Danger Patrol veteran might start every new game with +4 power tokens.<br/><br/>If 1-to-1 turned out to be too much, you could increase the number of spikes to get another power token after the first, either 2/1 or constantly increasing (1-2-4-8).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226508/#Comment_226508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T09:43:27+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  9:43AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Was one of these at Games on Demand Saturday afternoon?

To me, one of the "killer apps" of Danger Patrol is picking those two cards and then picking some powers - fast character creation where your choices <i>potentially </i> mean something beyond a stylistic preference.  In particular I want some styles or roles to be more mobile, some better at helping others, some better at mitigating damage to their allies, etc. - niche protection that goes beyond resource management of "I want to spend power tokens to do more damage/take less damage/take another action.  This is something 4E does well and I like the original intent/attempt of DP to do something like that.  And then later I hope for some styles/role having unique contributions/powers during interlude scenes.<br/><br/>I had the opportunity to do another playtest (no post on it) where we playtested the "Other rules changes" you describe above except with a danger die on the card that you roll beforehand and can provide only danger instead of a "danger point." Also Stunned/Injured = you still succeed on a "4" along with the added danger.  It all worked pretty well.  The game ran much smoother than my first attempt owing some to a better play environment and to me incorporating some ideas from Judd's game, I think.<br/><br/>I agree with with potentially reducing equipment in some fashion.  Another possibility is to have equipment add a skill die of the appropriate type rather than be a bonus die (which are current diminished d10/d8/d6 dice depending on how many other bonus dice you're rolling in that instance). e.g. a Daredevil uses his Magna Grapple Line to add a d12 to a Daredevil action.  d12s are fun to roll.  I'd guess I'd reduce equipment to two items in a scenario like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226574/#Comment_226574" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T13:32:53+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  1:32PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you had a chance to play at GenCon and it's cool that a power-free version worked for you guys.
