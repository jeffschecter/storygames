That was damned fun. Every character was taken but Snargle, who I NPC'ed as a rather comical shape-shifting wookie.<br/><br/>Refresh Scenes and Uriah Flint<br/><br/>The first scenes, escaping from the brig on the Hand of Sorrow, I could feel everyone trying to figure out their pasts, their current relationships.<br/><br/>So, after a bunch of them had spent some of their pools and had some Conditions, we did our first refresh scene. I kind of took control of them a bit. In TSoY, we have pools to give the refresh scenes a baseline. So, I suggested that we make refresh scenes flashbacks and it worked wonderfully. Having refresh scenes after big action pieces really gave the game a nice kind of structure that felt really solid.<br/><br/>The first refresh scene was how they all met, with them all together in a bar in Ilysium, Lady Blackbird hiring the crew to take her to the Remnants. It was fun.<br/><br/>The second refresh scene was how every person involved met Uriah Flint, which was really solid. Jeff was playing Lady Blackbird and I started to frame a scene of how Uriah first seduced the 16 year old lady but that was pretty flat (unless watching me RP a pirate trying to seduce Jeff is sexy to you) but the scene that was interesting was Uriah convincing the girl that he should ransom her back to her father and that he'd come back to get her.<br/><br/>I had to make a private decision about Uriah and honestly, though the game was fun, I made the wrong one. I made the decision that he was a mercenary bastard who didn't care about her. That was a dull decision and it made the end of the game rather flat.<br/><br/>I'd rather he was a mercenary bastard who really did love her but didn't think the pirate life would be good for her and more importantly that he didn't feel he was good enough for her. But here she is, having made it to the remnants on her own steam and coin, right in his face, proving him wrong. Now what?<br/><br/>That is where its at.<br/><br/>More on the dice and such later.<br/><br/>Next to write about:<br/><br/>My Pre-Game Solar System XP Speech<br/><br/>Conditions and Mechanics<br/><br/>Magic                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202591/#Comment_202591" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-18T11:53:26+00:00" title="April 18, 2009 11:53AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2009 11:58AM by Judd.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Pre-Game Solar System XP Speech<br/><br/>After explaining how the keys work and what they get XP for doing:<br/><br/>"Here's the pattern I see with games that use Keys.  At first the players who are new to it ask for permission.  Then they kind of try to make eye contact or ask if they think their key was hit while their hand makes its way towards the XP.  And after about three scenes, they just take XP.  Some folks take them after each scene, others take it as soon as something comes up, either way is fine.  Honestly, just take it; having to deal with XP is one less thing I have to do as GM and I can concentrate on other things.<br/><br/>"You are not cheating by taking XP; just take it when you hit a key and you'll know.

When they seem to be sitting tight, I have a relief guard come up and mention that they now know that the ship is Vance's and the Captain is on his way down to the brig to torture the pirate.<br/><br/> - In Nightport, they saw the bawdy play, The Seduction of Lady Blackbird (it has been EIGHT years; her fling with Flint is now legend) and we see Flint have sex with the Lady and then a woman in every port in the solar system and then a finale with ALL of them at once.  Lady Blackbird had some words with Alice Keel, the "actress" who played her in the play and was allegedly, Flint's Nightport wife.<br/><br/>Turns out, the play was quite different than the opera of the same name that played for so many years in Ilysium.<br/><br/> - Bishop notices that a ship captain has a slaver's tattoo.

I liked those rules from Spirit of the Century, but they might complicate Lady Blackbird too much because they are similar to the existing rules for Keys<br/><br/> ... unless Conditions <i>are</i> Keys (imposed by the GM). Imagine that the Angry Condition is treated like a "Key of Anger": if your character is Angry and you play angry, you can earn XP/etc just like hitting a regular Key. With "Condition Keys", the rules would have fewer special cases <i>and</i> Conditions have well-defined mechanical effects. This introduces interesting game play: players might be tempted postpone refreshment scenes because they don't <i>want</i> to lose a Condition!

Add <i>Intrigued, Ashamed, Ostracized, Attracted,</i> or whatever the circumstances demand.  Players have more control over the Condition if it operates only as a Key, but I like the notion of a Compel.  It's not like you have to have only one or the other.  A Condition could operate like a Key that permits the occasional Compel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202819/#Comment_202819" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T16:14:52+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  4:14PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For days I've had the notion of the condition <i>Enamoured</i> floating around in my head, thinking it'd be totally redundant.

I think the reward for buying off Keys is that you can get new Keys that are more likely to give you XP than the old Keys that are no longer appropriate (and therefore harder to hit).  Do players really need an additional incentive?  I think the Buyoff for any Key should basically be "find another Key to replace it with" and if Keys and Aspects are basically the same thing, finding a new Key is dead simple.<br/><br/>So, like, if my Key/Condition/Aspect is <i>Dead</i> and I want to buy it off, I have to both 1) not be Dead anymore, in the fiction, and 2) find a new Key/Condition/Aspect to replace Dead.  Maybe I get some alchemist to cobble together a new body for me made of decomposing pieces of corpses and mad steampunk science.  So I pick a new Key/Condition/Aspect that's like <i>Thing That Should Not Be.</i><br/><br/>In this spirit, what if <i>Conditions are temporary Keys/Aspects that replace some of the character's Keys/Aspects until they are bought off</i>.  So maybe I'm normally really dashing or something, but I'm injured or scarred or become infatuated with Lady Blackbird and keep making a fool of myself (and get XP for roleplaying those).  But when I eventually buy off that Condition, I can return to being dashing, if I like.  Or maybe, if I choose not to buy off the Condition, I just allow the character to be permanently changed by it.  Perhaps my infatuation with Lady Blackbird has altered me, so I'm no longer the womanizing rogue I was before.  In this way, Conditions aren't punishment or additional Keys but, uh, more like character development.  Maybe you should call them something besides Conditions, though.  Just another option, maybe not appropriate for all games.<br/><br/>P.S. In one hack I was working on, the monsters were basically this kind of "condition"; they were things that you must describe terrorizing your character and the Buyoff was a certain number of scenes/actions that your character must endure the monsters before escaping/killing them.  So these "conditions" could even be measured numerically.  If I have <i>Dead 5</i> that could mean I have to hit the Key/Aspect/Condition "Dead" five times (for 5 XP) before the Buyoff (maybe that is the Buyoff or maybe that's just a minimum and I still have to complete the Buyoff requirements).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202856/#Comment_202856" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T18:44:00+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  6:44PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool.

playstorm my game-thing, but it turned out that my POS work computer i'd tried to print the doc out on choked on the last page and a half, so we decided to play Lady Blackbird (they'd originally each been given a 50/50 chance anyway, we'd rolled dice to decide what to do). it was fun.<br/>there was just me and two of my friends.  i think it would have been better with more people.  but it was still fun.<br/>one of my friends had a weird reaction when i tried to "fish" with him.  the first thing they did was try to pick the lock of their cell.  they passed the test and opened the door but I said that when they did they saw something that worried them and asked what it was.  one of my friends was like, "Wait, why are we deciding that?  That's weird."  My other friend was more game to pick something, but still was hesitating a lot so I ended up deciding anyway.  Maybe I shouldn't have done that after the first roll.  The rest of the session went smoother, though I didn't do any fishing that was as blatant as that, though I did stuff like allowing Cyrus (the other player was playing the Lady) to make a roll to try to remember the layout of ships like that and when he passed to say what was in the next room.<br/>They also were both a little hesitant about taking xp for their keys.  After the session, the player who'd played Blackbird said that he thought the other player was maybe taking too much.  I said, "Maybe you weren't taking enough," and we looked at his keys and he said, "Well, I've got this Key of the Mission.  I could have taken that for about everything I did."  I shrugged and said, "Maybe you should have."  After the session, they also both had ideas about mechanical complications they thought would make the game more interesting if they were added.  But I think we all had fun.  I'm not sure if we'll continue it or not, but I don't think anyone would mind if we did.  One thing that strikes me is that after just one session, I don't think it would be that hard to add another player or two if we got more people later.<br/>Oh, also, I'm not really sure if there's an officially "correct" way to deal with statted out characters that aren't being handled by a player.  I decided to handle them like any other NPC, which is basically to say, not at all.  I didn't roll dice for them.  But since they were on the player's side, I would have them contribute an extra die to things they were helping out with.  I'm curious about how other people that have run this without 5 players handled the unused PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203520/#Comment_203520" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T06:51:05+00:00" title="April 25, 2009  6:51AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Oh, also, I'm not really sure if there's an officially "correct" way to deal with statted out characters that aren't being handled by a player.

It seemed to work out okay, but IIRC, it made it hard for Naomi's and Kale's players to hit some of their keys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203530/#Comment_203530" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T09:11:41+00:00" title="April 25, 2009  9:11AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I probably stated that poorly due to it being so late and being very tired at the time.  I kind of said I didn't do anything with them.  I really just meant that I didn't do anything with them <i>mechanically</i>.  They still moved around and helped and screwed up and whatnot in the fiction.  And since my friends took my advice and played Vance and Blackbird (though I'm sure other combinations work, they seem like the best choices since they're the key players) I had the support characters just keep supporting.  If either of them had not been taken as a PC, I probably would have played them the same way mechanically but stepped up their narrative action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203552/#Comment_203552" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T13:43:45+00:00" title="April 25, 2009  1:43PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Brian,<br/><br/>Thanks for posting about your game.

You were a burglar, right, can you pick the lock on our cell door?"  and I then had the player for Vance actually make the roll with an extra die from Kale.</blockquote>\nThat's a fine way to do it. You can also have Kale go "Sure, no problem!" and just go pick the lock. Then, if you want an obstacle here, he can stop and say, "Uh, Captain? This thing is wired to hell and back. I can open it, but it's gonna trigger the alarm," or whatever. This gives Vance's player a choice to make. Set it off and just run for it? Get an ambush ready then set it off and jump the guard when he checks it out? Sit tight and try to trick a crewman later? etc.<br/><br/>All of those lead to more direct obstacles and rolls for Vance. In other words, if no one is playing Kale or Bishop, directly breaking out of the cell doesn't have to be the first obstacle you dice for. (By the way, the obstacle for Bishop is, "Do you make a lot of noise smashing the door off its hinges?" not "Can you open the door?")<br/><br/>For PC vs. PC, they both roll and compare hits. If you tie, escalate the situation (which you always do when someone doesn't pass a roll) and roll again. The classic example is the two duelists that stalemate each other with their attacks, but they knock over a lamp and set the room on fire.
