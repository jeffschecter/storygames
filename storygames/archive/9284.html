Hopefully it will align with the three LBB. One of the things I am adding to the beginning is this<br/><br/>What is the game about?<br/>The game is about people (even whole societies) that are wanderers by choice, by fate, or by force. It's about creating an atmosphere of loss, treading on older failed civilizations,  wondering where did everyone go, and grim adventure. <br/><br/>How does it go about doing that?<br/>Traveller (that game this is based on) does not really address this. Some of this is encoded in the random tables but most is up the methods used in play. <br/><br/>What behaviors does it reward?<br/><br/>And I could use some help with answering these questions. Especially <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. My memory of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> was survival and growing old. But I think there is a better answer. Thanks!<br/><br/>PS I'll add you into the credits as well.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206194/#Comment_206194" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T17:40:23+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  5:40PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Survival" is the most common answer to question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, and is never the right one. (Although it'd certainly be impressive to find a game that proved this wrong.)<br/><br/>Growing old is more interesting. Why would someone keep wandering, despite growing old? What stops them from choosing a new home?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206196/#Comment_206196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T17:43:52+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  5:43PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been trying to sort this is out for awhile. I figured survival is not quite right but that was all that came to mind.
