The storylines slipped between a beautiful young socialite, diving into a conspiracy, a hacker going on a VR quest to hunt down or confront an AI (the descriptions of the virtual realms I remember were celestial), and a working grunt out to make a buck, fighting for his life on the streets. I'm paraphrasing the plots, but that's what I took away from it.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was mostly all dictated by a friend from NYC. Moment by moment narration brought us into the beautiful young woman's life as it changed irrevocably, and left us hanging waiting for more. <br/><br/>I had a work shift elsewhere, so I didn't get to finish the game. It felt like parallel stories, all brief insights into the larger cyberpunk world, waiting to be interlocked through our demands and deals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330979/#Comment_330979" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T09:52:49+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  9:52AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had good fun with our game <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12209" rel="nofollow">Somewhere</a> a little over a year ago.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could shed a little light on where the game disappointed you - what were you expecting, if anything, that it didn't deliver.
