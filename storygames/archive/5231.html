Then I got to thinking - what makes a game epic? We chatted and came up with a list of sorts, and now I'd like to ask you: To what degree do the following factors affect the epicnicity of a game?<br/><br/>1. The scope of the plot: a plot that encompasses things from the little tiny details all the way up to the major power structures and which have total repercussions on the whole game world - is this important/always true? <br/><br/>2. The length of a game: Can a game be short and epic? Can the necessary experiences and revelations be ondensed into a short run game, or does it have to last for 7 years? Many people talk about their favourite games and say "Man, we played that game for X years! It was so Epic!"<br/><br/>3. Engaging with your characters: Really feeling your characters are more than stats or genre clich\xe9s - the feeling and knowledge of how the events change your characters; familiarity with the World and the things going on in it, and how your character feels about that too (classic example: character comes to know and love a city, which is then destroyed, and <i>player </i>is distraught and vows revenge)<br/><br/>4. A real, personal Nemesis: Is it necessary to have someone to hate, someone who's defeat is a challenge worth sacrificing for?<br/><br/>5. Revelations, reversals and betrayals: Making the plot personal, then playing with your heads using classic storytelling techniques.<br/><br/>So which of these are necessary or unnecessary, and what examples can you give? What other things make for epicnessicity in gaming?<br/><br/><i><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=372429" rel="nofollow">Cross-posted with RPG.net</a></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118056/#Comment_118056" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T05:52:31+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  5:52AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2008 5:56AM by Alan.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha, that's funny!

If I'm making a game which aims towards epic, I know the game will have to be somewhat tailored to the players, so I have to be able to work with more than just <i>my </i>definition. I feel epic is in the tiny details, the feelings and the motivations of characters developing in a variety of situations, but other people get that crazy tingle from thousands of extras, or plots which change the world.<br/><br/>I'm not asking for much - just your thoughts and feelings. I plan to write a section on approaching an epic game from several angles, if that helps, so personal viewpoints will help me work out what general trends to address with regards to game play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118061/#Comment_118061" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T06:20:54+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  6:20AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, to elaborate more though, I've got this little game which has a setting that forces an eventual ending, so that the tension builds up towards a big climax. I feel that this may be a good sort of game to try to add that epic feel to, since (in my mind, as you say) a good epic has to have an ending. I just want to work out how to advise the GM and players on how to go about making that happen more often than not. Also I'm wondering if I need to write more into the main game to support epic (not awesome, that's different but linked) play. Like I think I need to put in more specific locations, that sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118072/#Comment_118072" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T09:08:52+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  9:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2008 9:08AM by Andy.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started writing, then I saw the RPGNet thread, then I saw the Wikipedia entry, which pretty much summs up what I was thinking.<br/><br/>For me, Epic is world-changing events, larger than life issues, etc. Doesn't matter if you start off as a farmhand, or as a 20th level paladin: If you're single-handedly saving the nation, the world, or the universe, that's epic:<br/><br/>auf 'pedia:<br/>-----------------------<br/><b>Epics have 6 main characteristics:</b><br/><br/>1. the hero is of imposing stature, of national or international importance, and of great historical or legendary significance<br/>2. the setting is vast, covering many nations, the world, or the universe<br/>3. the action consists of deeds of great valor or requiring superhuman courage<br/>4. supernatural forces--gods, angels, demons--interest themselves in the action<br/>5. a style of sustained elevation is used<br/>6. the poet retains a measure of objectivity<br/><br/>The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey, and returns home significantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates traits, performs deeds, and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society from which the epic originates. Many epic heroes are recurring characters in the legends of their native culture.<br/><br/>Conventions of Epics:<br/><br/><b>Praepositio</b>: Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed "to justify the ways of God to men"); of a question (as in the Iliad, where Homer asks the Muse which god it was who caused the war); or of a situation (as in the Song of Roland, with Charlemagne in Spain).<br/><b>Invocation</b>: Writer invokes a Muse, one of the nine daughters of Zeus. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero. (This convention is obviously restricted to cultures which were influenced by Classical culture: the Epic of Gilgamesh, for example, or the Bhagavata Purana would obviously not contain this element)<br/>In medias res: narrative opens "in the middle of things", with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.<br/><b>Enumeratio</b>: Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.<br/><b>Epithet</b>: Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., Homer's "rosy-fingered dawn" and "wine-dark sea."<br/>-------------------------<br/>...which I pretty much agree with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118081/#Comment_118081" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T11:12:07+00:00" title="January  5, 2008 11:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Andy said. "Epic" means it's gotta be big. I don't always take it to mean the world, literally has to change, but the characters' world has to change, and the characters are the ones who changed it. "The Godfather" is an example of what I mean in this regard - the "world" of Michael Corleone changes because of what he does, and his actions have big repercussions within that world (the mafia), and in the larger world around it. It's an epic story, with big plots, high stakes, lots of characters, but it's also intensely character focused on how those events shape and change those involved. Characters at the end of an epic should rarely be the same as when they started off, and (IMO) there should always be some price they've paid to reach their goals or achieve success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118082/#Comment_118082" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T11:16:17+00:00" title="January  5, 2008 11:16AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A single person's journey is an analog for a nation's journey (or even humanity's journey).<br/>\nThe hero's successes are physially represented in the world.<br/>\nIt's narrated in past tense ("and so it was...").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118085/#Comment_118085" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T12:01:25+00:00" title="January  5, 2008 12:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2008 1:22PM by noclue.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, not to pick a nit, but I think an epic can be the stories of more than one hero, as long as you have that sweeping backdrop, big issue stuff. <br/><br/>I don't think epics need to be narrated in the past tense. The Lord of the Rings is perfectly valid epic fiction without past tense narration. Guy Gavriel Kay is a particular favorite of mine for epic tales and they aren't past tense.<br/><br/>Edit: serves me right for rushing. Those books do use past tense (frodo walked, gandalf said etc.) but i dont think its what makes them epic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118099/#Comment_118099" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T14:28:00+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  2:28PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside \u2013 it's my understanding that the use of stock phrases was because the poet would be partly improvising the poem.
