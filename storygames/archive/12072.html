It starts with <a href="http://benhimself.livejournal.com/194874.html" rel="nofollow">this entry</a>, and you can follow the whole thing <a href="http://benhimself.livejournal.com/tag/planescape" rel="nofollow">at this tag</a>.<br/><br/>It's great reading, but my favorite part of the whole thing is the plot hooks he's started posting at the end of each entry.\n<blockquote>A very rich merchant's scheming and manipulative wife passes away. He hires some diviners, and they note that she has, in fact, become a Lemure on Baator, and for the moment, retains her distinctive laugh whenever she sees someone get hurt. The merchant, being somewhat addle-coved in grief, puts a very large bounty on anyone who can bring said Lemure to him. Large enough to attract the PCs' attention, even.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A swamp surrounding an old wizard's tower are rumored to be haunted, with strange lights floating about at night. It's actually just the wizard's familiar, a Light Aasimon, trying to make sure the old chap receives proper burial. Of course, it also knows the ways of adventurers, and is pretty certain what'll happen to the wizard's books and treasure vault afterwards, so it's also trying to make sure only the worthy make their way to the tower. And the Light Aasimon wasn't the only magical guardian the wizard's tower has, of course...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Amnizu lifts its hand off the PC's head, crackling energy leaving a burn as it removes all traces of the last 24 hours from said PC's memory, and says "Our deal is now complete", before teleporting away. Wait, what?</blockquote>\nThis is SOLID GOLD, man.  I'm hoping he publishes the whole thing as a PDF eventually.<br/><br/>Combined with the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11661" rel="nofollow">Psionics Handbook thread</a>, this is making me consider all my dusty 2E splatbooks in a new light.  There is a lot of very broken, very imaginative material out there for old-school D&amp;D, and I suspect most of us have a box or two of it in storage.  Who says you have to play it with the system it was written for?<br/><br/>If you had a D&amp;D period, or even if you didn't, what's a source of content you remember fondly?  What would you play it with now?  "I'd have to make up something entirely new" is a valid answer, but, eg, I'm thinking that the focus on factions and powerful objects (and, hell, gates) might make Mist-Robed Gate a neat fit for running something resembling Planescape.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270414/#Comment_270414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T00:44:18+00:00" title="May  8, 2010 12:44AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh dear.

I almost plugged it myself when I did the Githyanki entry (because, well, Githyanki) but I did feel a little... awkward about self-promotion, even if it's not necessarily taboo here.<br/><br/>I've really dug rereading all those old entries, discovering gems I had forgotten about or never noticed in the first place (Seriously, Bebilith venom, dude), but with the first compendium where I started doing the plot hooks is where it really took off for me: reading all that color and fluff with an eye towards "How could I [i]use[/i] this?" really does change the perspective than just reading it for "what's neat about this dude?" I should engage in some retconjuration and do plot hooks for that first supplement book, too. Hmmmm.<br/><br/>I'm torn regarding system for Planescape. I still really like the idea of hacking Mouse Guard: You've got hostile environment and mechanics for Significant Journeys, the PCs are very close to being at the bottom of the setting's pecking order, and of course, it's all about what you believe in (and teamwork, important for any D&amp;D-setting-derived game, I think). Apocalypse D&amp;D would be interesting too, especially adding special moves for each Faction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270429/#Comment_270429" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T08:11:21+00:00" title="May  8, 2010  8:11AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great!

The plot hooks especially.<br/><br/>I played about three sessions of 2E D&amp;D ever and had a pretty negative experience with it, so I don't have a lot of 2E setting nostalgia, obviously.  (the Planescape Torment crpg is over ten years old now so I can have a little nostalgia there I suppose)<br/><br/>I got an al-Qadim sourcebook as a freebie from an rpg shop mail order a few years back.  I skimmed it, curious.  I thought it was wonderful.  I collected every al-Qadim sourcebook I could find and read them all, glossing over the rules.  Pretty much all wonderful in my eyes.<br/><br/>I started a Fate conversion and put a fair amount of work into it.  I ultimately abandoned it - no perceivable audience.  Only half of the group I imagined running it for was sold on Fate, and only one of them seemed to have much enthusiasm for the setting, none of them having much familiarity with it.  I needed more buy-in for the mechanics based on the Zakharan themes of honor, family, hospitality, purity and piety I was developing.  Never mind the Aspects they'd need to develop and make sing for their characters based on the parts of the setting that attracted them.<br/><br/>I'd like to go back to it again someday, either with Fate or some other system, (probably TSOY/Lady Blackbird), but game prep or supplementation for games I'm actually playing always intervene.  It's hard to sustain work on such a large project knowing you may never get to play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270672/#Comment_270672" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T21:02:23+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  9:02PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After Psionics, Planescape was my second RPG love (followed by Shadowrun).
