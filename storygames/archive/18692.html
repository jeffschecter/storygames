Those settings do a great job of establishing thesis statements about their world and point of view and then demanding in a most wonderful way that players create characters that are corollaries to the core ideas of the setting.</blockquote>\nI'd love to explore what people think the thesis statements of these settings/games are. What do you think they are?<br/><br/>(As I start to work on my own new fantasy setting, I'm trying to be more aware of what world-building is capable of, and what separates the bad from the good from the exceptional.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419696/#Comment_419696" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T08:47:57+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  8:47AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2013 8:48AM by Ignotus.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Planescape was very up front about its core theme: belief shapes reality.

The theme of Tenra is expressed in the mechanics of the Aiki/Kiai/Karma cycle, rather than in the setting.

The setting was all about that and supported that idea (at least it did in 1e, I'm not familiar with what came later).<br/><br/>Iron Kingdoms (which was an rpg setting before a minis game) was about characters affected by geopolitical constraints and struggling to define themselves given their various nationalistic (not racial) allegiances.<br/><br/>That's what's helpful to me and what makes world-building coherent.  What is about? What core idea is thriving behind all the character choices? How do each of the character archetypes available reflect the central theme? And I think that's where Numenera falls down for me and where I'll try to make it work for me and mine -- that is, how are the characters positioned with regards to the ancient technology that surrounds them? Do they push for that next cycle -- that next singularity -- or do they try to repulse it? Ideally, the game should be all about the priests in the setting and their established outposts; the setting should be focused on that idea, not on Anything, Anywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419706/#Comment_419706" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T10:19:46+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 10:19AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great summaries...really interested to see what people think of others.

It's more of a "what do characters do here?" answer. I suspect you mean something different than I do by "thesis." <br/><br/>The subject of a setting is what it's about. The way you're describing Iron Kingdoms and Exalted here sound like what I call "Situation" (from The Big Model). Basically "how characters connect to setting."<br/><br/>The theme of a setting is what it has to say. In your other thread, it sounded like you were talking about theme: "point of view" and "the future is weird!" I can't tell from your descriptions what the point of view the authors of Exalted and Iron Kingdoms intend to convey.<br/><br/>[ASIDE: Just looked up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(narrative)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Theme (narrative)</a> on Wikipedia. It distinguishes between <i>thematic concept</i>, which is the "what it's about," from <i>thematic statement</i>, which is "what the work says about the subject". So you're on solid ground here.<br/><br/><br/><b>Theme as a question</b><br/><br/>Generally, theme is presented as a thesis, as a statement to be proven by the work. In books, that's fine. In a setting, where everything is tested by contact with player characters, theme is more of a question.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>My setting stuff</b><br/><br/>If my Opal Empire setting has a theme yet, it's something along the lines of, "People don't need deities."  Or as a question, "Do people still need deities?"<br/><br/>The gate between heaven and earth is forever locked. Spellcasting priests, cut off from their source of divine power, realized that the people were always the source of mana; now they collect it in rituals and distribute it to their adherents from temples and shrines. Elven philosophy and religion took a decidedly secular turn, mimicking in some ways Confucianism and Tao. The dwarves headed more the path of Secular Humanism. Only the humans cling to the idea that their gods might return someday, so they best behave. <br/><br/>People's spirits don't ascend to the heavens anymore, but instead get trapped on earth as wanderers. A small minority of people learned to gather those spirits (a sort of reverse spiritual possession) and use them for advanced power. Resurrection is expensive but pretty common, because it's so easy to return spirits to their bodies (or another handy body, a la SF like Altered Carbon).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419708/#Comment_419708" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T10:39:58+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 10:39AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warhammer Fantasy - The world is full of dark humor.

To quote.\n<blockquote>Narrativist Premises focus on producing Theme via events during play. Theme is defined as a value-judgment or point that may be inferred from the in-game events. My thoughts on Narrativist Premise are derived from the book The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri, specifically his emphasis on the questions that arise from human conundrums and passions of all sorts.\n<ul><li>Is the life of a friend worth the safety of a community?</li>\n<li>Does love and marriage override one's loyalty to a political cause?</li>\n<li>And many, many more - the full range of literature, myth, and stories of all sorts.</li></ul>\nNarrativist Premises vary regarding their origins: character-driven Premise vs. setting-driven Premise, for instance. They also vary a great deal in terms of unpredictable "shifts" of events during play. The key to Narrativist Premises is that they are moral or ethical questions that engage the players' interest. The "answer" to this Premise (Theme) is produced via play and the decisions of the participants, not by pre-planning.\n<ul><li>A possible Narrativist development of the "vampire" initial Premise, with a strong character emphasis, might be, Is it right to sustain one's immortality by killing others? When might the justification break down?</li>\n<li>Another, with a strong setting emphasis, might be, Vampires are divided between ruthlessly exploiting and lovingly nurturing living people, and which side are you on?</li></ul></blockquote>\nIt sounds to me like the same thing, with the questions and all. I use another term which I call meaning. Meaning is raising philosophical, ethical, spiritual or social questions through your game.

One just needs to compare to <i>Mage: the Ascension</i> to see the difference: in that latter game the prime movers and shakers of the setting know this to actually be the case, and act accordingly, waging a war that is primarily of propaganda and culture, with the occasional firefight thrown in where overt power does the most good. Player characters constantly face the constraints and opportunities the consensus reality begets. In Planescape, on the other hand, we have Sigil, with some largely pointless factions (with insipid philosophies that hang loose from any external political interests; a Sigil faction is generally only of interest to other Sigilians) that don't seem to actually have any power over anything except their piddly little city (where the real power is held by an autocratic god, too). Then we have the planes, where a conflict is on not between different beliefs, but rather between different celestial powers of unimaginable magnitude; we know that it's not a war of beliefs, for if this were the case, then the goals and means of the war would not so resemble an entirely ordinary military campaign.<br/><br/>The only place where Planescape pays lip service to that theme is in the idea that sometimes some individual places slip from one plane to another according to the consensus of belief among the populace. This is, as far as I can see, a throw-away idea that does not actually affect anything important in the setting. In Mage the nature of everything has been redefined by the Technocratic paradigm; in Planescape some no-name hamlet might move this way or that, but this has literally never in the history of the setting done anything discernible to the eternal balance of the Wheel, with Good vs. Evil and Law vs. Chaos. There is no proof whatsoever that belief actually defines anything in Planescape except which flag you fight under; if that's the extent of this supposedly fantastical theme, then we can say that in the 30 Year's War belief defines reality, too.<br/><br/>If I had to suggest the real theme of Planescape, I'd have to say that it's the nature of power politics and their impact on a multi-layered, pluralistic modern society. The people of Sigil and the planes have to deal with cold wars between immensely powerful factions, as well as the Blood War, which is very much a hot war, but happening far away. Sigil itself is like cold-war Berlin or Helsinki or Hong Kong, a meeting place on neutral ground for all political interests, including its own. The society is immensely varied across the multiverse, and the player characters are cosmopolitan travelers with superficial interests in any particular places they experience. Everything is defined in terms of the ideological system that takes the form of near-absolute natural law, just like in the Cold War. The role of adventurers is most often that of spies or commandos in service to one of the political interests; the game specifically offers no tools whatsoever for defining or influencing belief, which is what one would expect were that the theme.<br/><br/>(I should note that I like Planescape, so the above is not to imply anything about its quality. This particular thing is just a pet peeve, everybody says that its theme is something that plainly doesn't seem to be the case. I've no idea how this came to be.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419739/#Comment_419739" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T13:20:08+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  1:20PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a pretty interesting thread topic, now that I got my Planescape hang-up out of the way.

This is because a big setting is truly more of a literary thing than a creative narrativist challenge - or rather, let's say that while you can interpret some settings in functional terms with a narrativist agenda in mind, you can interpret them all in literary terms, and thus the latter is a more equitable question when doing comparisons over a wide range of settings. Planescape, for instance - it doesn't really have a premise as a setting, but it sure has a theme, and that theme is that people - even demons and devils - are people despite the ideological posturing of modernist, cold-war era politicians (as represented in Planescape by all the stuffed shirts of the Great Wheel).<br/><br/>And of course a big work of fiction or a complex game can have multiple themes and premises and topics - difficult to name a great one without having multiple layers and a wide range of topics that only form an unity within the worldview of the author.<br/><br/>That aside, my view on another setting: I think that Gotham City is predominantly about how moral nihilism is given birth in socio-economic context, and how it causes human suffering. If we're to believe Gotham regarding fundamental human nature, it's very natural for human virtue to succumb to peer pressure (of the most insane sorts - insanity in Gotham is very much infectious and memetic), which in turn leads to a cycle of suffering that degrades both the victim and the perpetrator. Moral purity in this context comes rarely from human society; it is, rather, an in-born transcendent quality of "decentness", or a philosophical choice, or naivete untouched by Gotham as yet.<br/><br/>(That's my attempt at separating the theme of the setting as understood by roleplaying from the theme of the comics and characters, which is an interesting challenge in itself. For those wondering, I base the above massively generalized impression on my last year's Batman binge, wherein I read every Batman comic book from the period of 1987-2008 or so.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419759/#Comment_419759" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T19:58:05+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  7:58PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting topic. <br/>On a quick thought, and I'm not sure I get the notion of theme right, but I'd say that before "theme", I'm looking for stakes.<br/>What's at stake in the world?

I'd clarify that you're talking about stakes for the fictional characters of the world here, and maybe even the non-player characters rather than the player characters.<br/><br/>It might be more useful to look at setting creation through the lens of what is at stake for the PCs. This is basically Situation, in Big Model terms, right? where Character meets Setting.<br/><br/>For me, I can't even get to Situation in a directed sort of way without knowing what I'm going on about in the first place. I can brainstorm and come up with cool ideas but they're not coherently connected.

The philosophers with clubs were all involved in this bizarre postmodern struggle where if they could convince enough people that they were right, <i>they would then become right</i>, and in fact turn out to have been right all along.  The blood war was ultimately a war over the right to interpret what it meant to be evil.  The gate towns, as Eero mentioned, are the most obvious example, and the easiest for the players to affect.  Similarly, the gods required believers to live, and died when they became forgotten.  The theme may not have affected the characters' power sets or immediate ambitions in the way it does in Mage, but nonetheless the idea that belief shapes reality motivated basically all the major conflicts in the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419810/#Comment_419810" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T14:06:43+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  2:06PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My point about FR was just that it's obvious that thematic coherence is hardly the only path to creating a useful setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419814/#Comment_419814" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T15:40:21+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  3:40PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Right on.

Yes, time. That is the only way to give <i>sense</i>. That's why I need to know what's happening <i>now</i>, what's at stake at the <i>moment</i>. Otherwise, it wouldn't just make sense.<br/>Some points :<br/>- I believe, somehow, my position is much or less in accord with this <a href="http://io9.com/7-deadly-sins-of-worldbuilding-998817537" rel="nofollow">article</a>. You need <i>history</i> if you want a good <i>story</i>.<br/>- Of course, you can tell me that my position is some kind of "simulation" (yes, simulation) of the "real" existence we can experience. Something very complex, with somehow a world crushing us (don't you ever feel that way?). Now, you may say that's not the kind of things you want in a rpg ... fine. But that is exactly what I'm looking for.<br/>- <i>time</i> is the key here. I want stakes and a timeline (would your life have sense if there was no events in the world?), a tight schedule with hard choices.<br/>- it would come to a "multitude" of themes to explore that would overlap each other (something mention earlier here).<br/><br/>Now, if you allow, a simple example :<br/>I just love stuff like this : "Does love and marriage override one's loyalty to a political cause?". That's great !!<br/>Now, what's the context? Let's say "Rome <i>at the time</i> of the end of the republic". Or "The united state <i>at the time</i> of the civil war". When I say <i>at the time</i>, it is truly at the time : there are events coming !! This is not a frozen setting !!!<br/>The situation might become very complex, and very quick. And the "Does love and marriage override one's loyalty to a political cause?" might soon become "how long can one stay blind to a false politic cause?".<br/>When you see <i>sense inside </i>a theme, I do see <i>sense</i> when themes <i>compete</i> (one is as good as the other, I'm just pointing a difference).<br/><br/><b>Do you understand my position?</b><br/><br/>Now, to achieve such a product, you'll have to come up with something different than greyhawk or FR.\n<blockquote>All my observations about theme and thesis?

I think the setting has really great ideas, that are poorly implemented. <br/><br/>The factions are indeed innocuous as political parties, and the way they are setup in the city functions/offices dont promote any interesting conflict between them. With the possible exception of the 3 law-related ones (Guvners, Harmonium and Mercykillers ?) the other ones dont have conflicting positions nor interest in actual city politics, their acting spheres not crossing at all. Its all too static and sanityzing. And this tendency reflects to the whole setting (the text says how everything is constantly changing and in constant conflict, but in truth nothing really is);<br/><br/>Also, the main setting theme (power of belief) is not manifested in the gameplay at all. At the very least, there should be some formal rule adressing that. (actualy, there IS one - the Belief Points from Planewalker Sourcebook - but its so simplistic and frankly poorly thought-out that it doesnt change much).<br/><br/>Anyway, Planescape continue to be onw of the more fascinating settings for me.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419838/#Comment_419838" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T10:20:01+00:00" title="August  9, 2013 10:20AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Right on.

You might as well ask if GURPS' setting has a theme.<br/><br/>The theme of my last Forgotten Realms game was "Being a rich, famous celebrity means a lot of hard dangerous work but damn it's SWEET!!!!!"
