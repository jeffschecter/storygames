He-binds-us-together looks at the night sky and sees He-eats-the-sun a massive, ebony six armed creature climbing from star to star towards the full moon. The creature begins to envelop the moon plunging the world into darkness. Thinking fast, he throws a rock which draws Eats-the-sun's attention who swings down from the stars to consume this little morsel. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, He-flies-with-ravens (Ghost society) and She-feeds-the-wolves (Bone society), who have been involved in a magical game of cat and mouse of curses and counter-curses, have fallen in love. They edge away from the group and decide to add to the power of the moon by combining their power in a passionate act of lovemaking. The moon waxes so brightly as the two magicians experience climax  that Eats-the-sun is driven away back into the darkness. They return to the group, moonlight trickling down the inside of She-feeds-the-wolves legs, and both know that the result of this pairing will be a truly puissant progeny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351364/#Comment_351364" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T10:53:47+00:00" title="December 13, 2011 10:53AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monsterhearts -<br/><br/>The Chosen goes to her favorite doctor with a bullet in her leg.

We're deep under Witch Island, battered and swamped by the vicious animated corpses of drowning victims, the avatar of the evil god has brought the darkness and it is looking bad for the party. Hard moves are falling like twelve-sided rain.<br/><br/>Samu the thief has never been a church-going man, but in his hour of desperate need he calls upon our god, who is a god that appreciates suffering a little bit. He tries to strike a bargain - his life for the lives of his two faltering friends. To get our god's attention he cuts his hand and does enough damage (accidentally!) to kill himself. Last Breath move fails, he's gone. Did his prayer and sacrifice work?<br/><br/>At that moment my cleric levels up, takes protection from evil, successfully casts it with the +1 from Samu's posthumous bond move, and the two survivors crawl out of that hell-hole.
