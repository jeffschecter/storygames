He hasn't done a lot of gaming for the last decade, mostly because he's been living in small towns and such. But he's also the guy who introduced me to Sorcerer, Whispering Vault, and the whole indie RPG scene, so I feel very much in his debt.<br/><br/>His current locale: Nevada City, CA.<br/><br/>Since I live on the East Coast, I don't know the first place to direct him for quality Story Game action. My suggestion was Google Hangouts, or the upcoming Indie+ event. Am I on the right track that there's no one out there?<br/><br/>Help Tor rejoin the scene!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
