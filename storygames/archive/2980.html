At the moment we're planing the festival and the date for it would be somewhere near Solmukohta (probably during AWIF [a week in Finland]). And FreeFall would be held in Finland, Helsinki.Production team is currently Producer Santtu M\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4tt\xc3\xa4nen and Juha-Pekka Natunen, both larpwrights of experimental games and professional organizers. Funding is still at question, but at the moment the festival should remain free of charge for participants and larpwrights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're interested in writing a larp-art-piece to FreeFall, please send us either your portfolio or presentation of your larp plan. We're going to read them through and chose the best ones out there to our festival. At the moment we're seeking for 25 games, to be held during five days. So we're seeking quite unique, experimental and short games, duration should remain between half-an-hour to five days (we're mostly seeking games between 1 and 5 hours of game time).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you think your up to the task, send as a e-mail (freefall.festival@gmail.com), post comment on our blog or shout so loud we can hear you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know anyone who might be interested, please send this mail forward!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour's truly<br/>\nPeople behind the festival<br/>\nSanttu &amp; Juha-Pekka<br/>\n<br/>\nPs. the blog referred to in the post can be found at: http://fffestival.livejournal.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88017/#Comment_88017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T09:59:35+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  9:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've made progress<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all Larpers world wide, we have some news for you. Ropecon weekend was inspiring, so it's time to update you all about what's going on FreeFall Festival. We are now officially in collaboration with Solmukohta. So we're going to give you all memorable Festival in conjunction with social events of AWIF.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're starting to have first drafts of the event and this far the Festival is looking to become one of the most interesting things happening in larp scene next spring. We hope that we can submit first versions of program before end of this month. I promise that we have known names as well as some not as familiar, and I hope that we're having at least one surprising name on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you still have an LARP you'd like to see at FreeFall Festival, please be in touch as soon as possible. You can find guidelines from our blog ( http://fffestival.livejournal.com ).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88426/#Comment_88426" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T13:45:33+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  1:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds interesting, but perhaps you could provide more details, either on your livejournal link or here? For example, it took a little digging to determine that: (and I might be wrong about some of this)<br/>- This event is in Finland<br/>- It is taking place in February of 2008<br/>- This is part of a convention that draws about 200 people<br/><br/>Some things that still are unclear to me:<br/>- Is it possible to attend this event at this point if you're not submitting a larp? I thought I saw a notice that registration was full and closed.<br/>- Are the larps at this event generally in English or other languages? How accessible is this event to your typical monolingual American?<br/>- How do you define "larp-art-piece"? Would this cover any larp that isn't live combat, or are there stricter requirements?<br/><br/>Please tell us more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88485/#Comment_88485" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T22:12:02+00:00" title="August 16, 2007 10:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I didn't know that Solmukohta was that badly known :) <br/>\n<br/>\nEvent is taking place 17.3.08 - 20.3.08 (This is the first official announcement, you heard it first)<br/>\nIn Helsinki, Finland (that should be mentioned in blog and in the first post as well). We're in collaboration with Solmukohta that draws about 200 people, but FreeFall is going to be marketed to much wider public (our estimates of people to attend are not calculated yet, but it ain't going to be sky high). Anyone can attend larps in FreeFall Festival, but as you might have noticed, we haven't started our marketing campaign to public yet. So at this point we have collected artists (larpwrights) to submit larp-art-pieces. Larps are going to be held generaly in English and some might be completely non vocal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow accessible this event is to monolingual American? Well, that depends on whether or not your familiar with Nordic style of larping. Language is not going to be a problem anyhow, and even if you ain't familiar with Nordic larps, you can attend and find out. I bet that would be quite a adventure for someone with American larp background.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinition of larp-art-piece? Most important one is that larpwright has an artistic goal, secondly we review the submissions to determine whether or not the larp manifests it self as art (this is mostly subjective review, but we don't judge larps with our own preferences on how larps should be wrote or how they should be held). Thirdly we have asked our larpwrights to send us an portfolio of their previous works, as in art field in general, we also like preferences. If work covers the points one and two, there's no problem. If point three is covered nicely we might discuss with larpwright bit about their idea if it didn't seem to pass those earlier points, how ever if it doesn't pass at all (even with modifications made after discussions) it doesn't pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else to tell you, ask me more..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99903/#Comment_99903" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T03:11:18+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  3:11AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So artist submissions are way over, timetables will be available shortly as will be details about the festival itself.
