Good question.<br/><br/>A visual novel is video game, the main gameplay mechanic of which is navigating a complex hyper-textual storyline.  (In English:  "Choose Your Own Adventure" novels, only AWESOMER.) The most common genres and themes for Visual Novels are mystery and romantic; this game will be a romantic wartime drama, using the hypertext sections to handle Interludes, as well as having mission scenes using the BS combat rules.<br/><br/>I myself play such excellent VN's like <a href="http://www.katawa-shoujo.com/" rel="nofollow">Katawa Shoujo</a> because when they are written well - and this <i>will</i> be written well, make no mistake - they are deep, rich, multi-layered storytelling experiences that you cannot get in any other format or medium.<br/><br/>Elizabeth -<br/><br/>1: The character concept art and sprites will be done by the incomparable Jasper Worsely, a recent graduate from Expressions Technical Art College of Emeryville.  His stuff is surreal and boss, let me tell you, and he refuses to cater to the weeaboo by making the sprites LOL ANIMU.  Not that he's opposed to making it look like, say, refined CLAMP; just that he won't pander to the fans by making Sara Smith into a moe-blob of a Genki Girl.  As for the ANIMa, backgrounds, and UI - our other artist is going to be Feyna Shapiro, who is pretty goddamn good at photography, surreal art, mechanical design, and shooping whoop.<br/><br/>2: We're considering voice acting; we'll let you know.  So far, the answer is "If we can get it done well and for cheap or free."  If those turn out to be mutually exclusive, forgeddaboutdit; that being said, one of our staff IS Anna Lin, full stop, so we have high hopes in that regard!<br/><br/>3: In universe, you mean?  The San Francisco Bay Area, particularly the ruins of the Treasure Island Job Corps Center (where I graduated with flying colors by learning that I never want to cook professionally ever again).<br/><br/>4: You will be in the shoes and the head of Joshua Preston; we would have liked to let you make your own character, but for our first truly complex project we didn't want to try (not to mention that the Josh running through my head is a very nice blend of cynical, romantic, and GAR.)  That being said, the storyline is going to have a ludicrous level of branching: 5 romantic paths and a platonic run are confirmed, with the possibilty of a sixth, as well as 3 mission paths besides "die horribly from searing rays and noxious smokes," and they intertwine in polymorphously perverse manners.<br/><br/>5: The Ren'Py scripting engine we're using says "Fuck yeah."  There will be a DOS, Linux, and Mac OSX distro.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232318/#Comment_232318" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T15:40:23+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  3:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, ok, that sounds hella cool then!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232344/#Comment_232344" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T18:07:38+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  6:07PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliott Belser</cite>he refuses to cater to the weeaboo by making the sprites LOL ANIMU</blockquote>\nIs it legal to use "weeaboo" and "animu" in the same sentence?<br/><br/>Seriously though, this sounds hella-sweet!

Without any major spoilers, Derek Smith is pretty goddamn gay.  Josh notes that Derek is pretty goddamn cute, as males go, too.  Whether or not Josh is willing to accept that he maybe, sometimes, might possibly, be attracted to another male depends on who's playing the game and thier preferences of course.<br/><br/>And come to that, it's impossible to avoid either Joshua being a little gay or Anna Lin being at least somewhat more than 0 on the Kinsey scale with the Anchors as statted.  I came down on the side WHY NOT BOTH LULZ: Derek will jokingly note that "Anna is such a freaking dyke.  Seriously.  Even when she's ordered the sausage instead of the tuna - freakin' dyke!"<br/><br/>Eric:<br/><br/>The first thing I did was go "No genki moeblob Sara.  No Rumiko Takahashi stretchy faces on the characters.  Making them look like refined shoujo manga / Eureka Seven is great, but Ranma 1/2 - hell, Evangelion - this ain't."  We might have some sketchy riffs on Gurren Lagaan when Josh is being particularly GAR, but so far the art style is roughly "The Maxx: Written by Sam Keith, illustrated by CLAMP."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233503/#Comment_233503" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T13:43:29+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  1:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2009 5:17PM by Elliott Belser.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite> Are you going to have everything purely text, or are you going to have the characters voiced? </blockquote>\nAt this point, after an incredible bout of auditions last weekend, we have an AMAZING Anna Lin, Preston Senior, and Sara Smith; we also have a very good Yukiko, the Savvy Anchor of one smooth operator you may know called Keenan Caine.  Also: probably a very good Keenan, and an original pilot, new to the game.  All I will say right now is that she's named Gabriel Veramor Winters, and that she is a Rising Hero... but she doesn't begin the game as part of the Treasure Island Resistance.  &gt;:3<br/><br/>Oh, and something else I'm going to have to add:<br/><br/>Q: Will this be a pornographic (Hentai) game?<br/><br/>A: The short answer is no, because we really like not going to jail on child porn charges.  <br/><br/>The long answer is that while we will have explicit discussions of sexuality in the vein of the better stuff marketed as Young Adult - The Golden Compass is particularly Bliss Stage to me, and I've had Weetzie Bat and Forever by Judy Blume suggested to me as examples of Where We Should Be Going - making the visuals similarly explicit is not only a legal but a marketing and branding issue.  We're sure we can pull it off with grace and charm, and that there would be no legal teeth in the argument that it wasn't a mature, artistic and sympathetic work undeserving of the "child porn" label - once we go up against a hostile judge and jury, we've lost a major battle for hearts and minds.<br/><br/>Our art is probably going to be pretty chaste for that reason, with a lot clearly implied.  The free Original English visual novel Ori~Ochi~Onoe is... a good example of the most explict we dare get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Biltcliffe" title="Adam Biltcliffe"><img alt="Adam Biltcliffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Biltcliffe">Adam Biltcliffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233698/#Comment_233698" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T13:34:35+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  1:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who's doing the writing?

I submit story outlines, the path writers write in, say, the voice of Meredith Odetta Baker (is Comforting), and I re-edit for clarity and Plot.<br/><br/>Also.<br/><br/>Q: Is there an official demo?<br/>A: At this point, some sort of playable demo of the mission is in the bag.  Barring Bliss Day tomorrow, we WILL be handing out Mission 00: Red Alert demos at <a href="http://www.yaoicon.com/" rel="nofollow">Yaoicon</a>, this October, so please oh please come by and just bliss out with us in the Swap Meet- we'll be posting costume guides here and elsewhere, and selling swag, as well.  <br/><br/>Also, we might make an appearance in the Masquerade... &gt;:3  Gotta have Viral, Marketing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
