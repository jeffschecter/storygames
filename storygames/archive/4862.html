Just for the eff of it.<br/><br/>Everything has hit dice. Ideas, relationships, people, kingdoms, religions, organizations. They all have hit dice. It is the GM's job to assign hit dice to things.<br/><br/>Player: "I want to use my diplomacy to destroy the links between the Vampire Kingdom and the Liche Kingdom."<br/><br/>Dungeon Master: "Alright, you can use your skill and it will be 1d6 for every five you make it over the target number. You can get an extra 2d12 if you go on the Quest of the Vampire Knights and solve that little problem that the valley is having with the death knights. The pact between the liches and the vampire kingdoms is 6d6. *rolls* comes out to 23 hit points (because, ally relationships between evil parties, nations and organizations can never be over d6 because of the distrust."<br/><br/>Player: "Yeah, that adventure's been staring us in the face for a while. It is due time. Let me roll for my Diplomacy, see what that get's us and that way if we have to bail out halfway and just take 1d12, it won't be the end of the world."<br/><br/>Everything has hit dice.<br/><br/>I'm talking myself into this.<br/><br/>How does the OGL work again?"<br/><br/>I had an imaginary conversation between a Dungeon Master and the players.<br/><br/>Here it goes...<br/><br/><b>Player</b>: Everything has hit dice, right?  Okay.  My first level Paladin, Leopold the Righteous is going to hit hell with his sword, driving any infernal influence from the Prime Material Plane.  Ha!<br/><br/><b>DM</b>:  It isn't quite that easy.  The Cults of Hell are powerful, 50d10 at least and you have to have a proper ability to strike against an organization like that.  In later levels, Paladins can smite evil organizations with their Base Attack Bonus, just as Rogues can attack lawful organizations, Clerics can turn other churches, Druids can attack urban organizations and Rangers can attack organizations linked to their hated enemies and Monks can attack relationships with their bare hands.  Wizards can cast spells that do all sorts of neat shit to organizations.<br/><br/>You can attempt to destroy the Cults of Hell.  That is fantastic and I think it'll be fun.  But it isn't going to be a fun single roll but a rockin' campaign.  Shall we?<br/><br/><b>Player</b>:  How is this going to work?<br/><br/><b>DM</b>:  Well, you are going to nickel and dime 'em for a while and then you'll see that members of their organization, their leaders can heal the damage you do.  You will get extra dice to attack the cults for going on adventures that close down portals to hell and other infernal powers.<br/><br/>There are different types, just like there are different types of monsters.  Organizations, Religions, Kingdoms, Relationships and they can all be damaged, healed and strengthened by the players' actions.  They work just like different monster types.<br/><br/>There are feats that allow you to create organizations and skill rolls high enough can create relationships between the organizations.<br/><br/>Hm, I'm essentially <i>Reign</i>ing D&amp;D, aren't I?<br/><br/>Hmf.<br/><br/>Well, there it is for now, a fun tinker.<br/><br/>Thoughts and feedback are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109072/#Comment_109072" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T21:54:20+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  9:54PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 9:58PM by Eric.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hit dice and how hard something is to kill are very poorly correlated in DnD 3.X. Just something to keep in mind when presenting this to the "Player" in the example. Like, if "Player" is playing a wizard, the fact that something has 50d10 HD means precisely dick if "Player" has a properly minmaxed spell selection. If you then tell them that their hated foe, the Church of All Badness, has 50d10 HD and behaves in all ways like a creature, it doesn't take a terribly creative wizard to start spamming save-or-lose spells at this strange abomination, confident in the fact that the d20 will eventually show a 1. <br/><br/>That said, you could make this much more workable if you also make throwing around hitpoint damage into the only way to win a fight, or even to engage in combat. <br/><br/>Also, the notion that I cannot even launch an attack against a certain type of creature until I gain a class feature or a certain level is pretty contrary to the way the rest of DnD works.<br/><br/>Be veeeery wary of this: "skill rolls high enough can create relationships between the organizations," because a halfway dedicated player can get a skill check of "crazy" in whatever skill you care to think of, provided you have enough incentives to make it worth their while. Diplomacy works this way right now, with its ability to generate fanatical followers out of any intelligent opponent - that's more than enough incentive to have bards walking around with +40 diplomacy modifiers by level 6. If skill checks can re-write things on that large a level, either  cut back skill bonuses severely or expect to have a game about manipulating organizations like pawns on a chess board (which is awesome, but perhaps not what you had in mind).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109073/#Comment_109073" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T22:00:37+00:00" title="November 20, 2007 10:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts, Eric.<br/><br/>How is having special feats to attack organizations any different than waiting to have a magic item to attack certain creatures who need +1 or +2 or better or what-not...or am I flashing back to dated parts of D&amp;D that are no more?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>If skill checks can re-write things on that large a level, either  cut back skill bonuses severely or expect to have a game about manipulating organizations like pawns on a chess board.</blockquote>\nThey can't re-write but they can have an effect.

I have Reign but I haven't read it yet; I basically just stole the idea from FATE 2.0.  You have a task that has what is essentially a Stress track from Spirit of the Century, and when players accomplish player level goals during the campaign they are able to make "attacks" on goals or on organizations which are at a higher tier/level than them.  When they build up enough Stress they can start to inflict Consequences on them (Aspects)<br/>\n<br/>\nA single person in my campaign has an "Influence Rating" of 0 (Mediocre).  If they have a Title Aspect, it's increased by 1.  If they have the Resource Skill at Great or Superb it is also increased by 1, so the absolute maximum IR an individual can have is 2.  Organization have similar Ranks with a base of 1 rather than 0 and going up from there based on size and Resources.  A given entity cannot do anything more than a Mild Consequence against an another entity which has a rank higher than it, but having tagged it, they've perhaps given an opportunity to a similarly sized entity to follow up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do the same thing with what I call "Things that Might Be", things that might come into being if the characters put resources towards it in between session.  This gives them something to do with any left over Fate Points at then end of a session.  They can also do this on a meta level as players rather than as characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome examples from my current game:<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo opposing "Things That Might Be:<br/>\n<br/>\nNeferu, The High Priestess of Karanis, is the most powerful Priestess in nine generations.  It is her power which has protected the Kheth.  Without her, Karanis would have fallen to the Others long before now. (Fantastic)<br/>\n[X][ ][X] Consequences: The People Whisper Such Nonsense! (Mild)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeferu, The High Priestess of Karanis, is in league with the heretical Soulmancer sect, those who harvest not demons for their power, but humans. (Superb)<br/>\n[X][X][X] Consequences: Do Not Speak Such Blasphemy! (Mild); Rahotep Himself Was Seen In Her Bedchambers! (Moderate)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above are meta-level.  Only one of them can be true.  Players have assigned left over Fate Points to one or the other, and a highly successful espionage effort in-game helped one of these "truths" along.  The second possibility is "winning" (i.e. the most wounded).  When one of them is "Taken Out", that thing will be true.  I expressed a slight preference for one over the other by setting the Defense of one "Truth" at Superb (5), and the other at Fantastic (6), but it's up to the players which way this goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nUgh.  I just realized what time it is.  More when I can.  Sorry, I know this won't make much sense without knowledge of FATE and my campaign...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109103/#Comment_109103" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T04:13:19+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  4:13AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd:<br><br>Good stuff.

So for my 24 rip-off, the PCs are operating against a depleting pool of time, impacted not just by time but by the degree of success or failure on their various checks that would impact it. One of the other settings I'm planning is a played-straight police procedural, where the PCs play, say, NYPD detectives in the narcotics squad trying to take down a drug kingpin's empire. The empire has its own depletable quality, which gauges its overall "health" and is impacted by the PCs doing things like cutting off suppliers, flipping one of the drug mules, etc.<br><br>So, yes, I think it can be done, and I think it would be cool. I don't even think it will be quite as hard as others are making out. The key, based on my own lengthy ruminations, is clearly defining what <i>types</i> of actions will impact the target so the players actually have some control over the course of play.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109119/#Comment_109119" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T07:03:07+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  7:03AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>Hit dice and how hard something is to kill are very poorly correlated in DnD 3.X.</blockquote>\nHit Points are basically a gauge of how much effort/resources it's going to take to bring an opponent down.

"Victory" (foe runs out of hp and is defeated) is a certain number of VP's accumulated with different sorts of actions in play and ways of handling scenes worth VP's.  Those VP's are still racked up facing challenges designed with the CR/EL system etc.  Take out the supply depot, that's 5 VP's towards 60 needed for victory, 20 needed to avoid total defeat etc.  Assassinate the general, 20 VP's. etc.<br><br>I'll be a bit contrarian now,<br><br>I think a key consideration it putting hit points to things is when do you want to abstract things in the way D&amp;D hp abstract wounds?  HP in D&amp;D are (among other things) an abstraction of wounds/health/luck running out rather than tracking "wound in left side, limp, arm broken".  You can "colour them" with descriptions but they are an abstraction and not a specific game outcome worked for in play (there's no particular attack to break someone's arm).  My concern is whether any system for putting hp on organizations/goals of different sorts leads to abstracting what would be, in d20, something the system shines at playing out and is part of its attraction to most who like it (tactical scale resolutions with pointy things).<br><br/>Do you want to abstract the tasks, NPC's involved etc.?<br/><br/>If using Diplomacy to attack an alliance you might colour the damage done as "an arranged marriage didn't happen, someone mistakenly things the other has broken part of the agreement already, someone thinks it's to their advantage to break the agreement".  That is for a "narrate facts to the dice" approach to these events common to many stakes-based, conflict-not-task-level, fast moving games.  I quite like those approaches, but I don't think that's really what d20 is good at/for in it's core.  That kind of approach should be used to "fill in for what it's not good at" (e.g., social contests etc.), but not make the game about that.  In my view you sign up to play D&amp;D/d20 to design characters effective in tactical situations.  If the game keeps being about other stuff, that's not the game you signed up for.  I would prefer to see tactical level play interfere with marriage, frame one party for having broken agreement (attack merchants disguised as soldiers of one side), show another party an advantage in breaking it (bring them proof of the weakness of their foes).  Those things are the "meaningful stakes" for the tactical, gamist scenes d20 is good at.  You can assign each of those outcomes "hp values" with the objective having a total to be achieved, and some could be achieved with a Skill DC roll (e.g., there's no reason Diplomacy situation can't be resolved using skill roll constructed similar to those a Trap' requires - test of 2 skills with different sorts of failure consequences - fail 1st and it's really bad, fail 2nd badly at it's still really bad but in a more controlled fashion).<br/><br/>Even there I would prefer a VP system for "adding up the effect of accomplishments" where it's not "at X value outcome achieved" but "a X1 this becomes situation, at X2 this, at X3 this (victory), at X4 this (uber victory)" as it has more variety to it (or a system where the VP was really a modifier applied to a roll to see what happens, the VP system is a bit "deterministic").  I would want the different accomplishments to require different skills, scenes (e.g., not be a series of one skill being applied).  Distributing the nature of the required tests to be passed to test different classes in particular and let them shine is part of d20 scenario design for group play.  Nothing big should ever be doable only relying on the strength/skill of one character/class.<br/><br/>Rob                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109144/#Comment_109144" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T08:48:34+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  8:48AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2007 8:50AM by J_Walton.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I do the same thing with what I call "Things that Might Be", things that might come into being if the characters put resources towards it in between session.

It also sounds a little bit like Loresheets in <i>Weapons of the Gods</i> which are my main inspiration (along with Keys in <i>The Shadow of Yesteday</i>).  It's also kinda like this "everything has hit dice" thing.  It works like this:<br/><br/>Each star on the map has a series of interesting secrets/situations that it holds.  By investigating a situation more deeply (by the players showing interest in it and leveling resources and rolls at it, basically), the situation opens up to reveal more secrets, secrets that generally connect with other stars, creating a giant web of stuff that the players slowly work themselves into.  And, because the modded-d20 system in <i>Firmament</i> will have you rolling against people and organizations and stars and problems and archaeological artifacts and travel routes as if they were monsters, the players directly influence how this web develops and how the universe unfolds around them.<br/><br/>That's the plan anyway.  I'm not as far along as you look to be.

You can't attack "the merchants' guild" without dealing with its members. In one sense, "the merchants' guild" doesn't exist, at least not in the same sense as an individual merchant exists. It's an abstraction. The concrete manifestation of it (its property, its members, their influence with other groups-made-up-of-people) are all that can be opposed.<br><br>Since I don't have levels as such, I'm using a concept of "Influence" based more or less on Tony Dowler's "Secret of Rank" in Principia. You have a ranking for your influence in a given sphere, and if you're trying to oppose someone of higher rank you're at a disadvantage unless you band together. People of high influence also have access to other people who report to them, who they can order to do things, within reason, to serve the goals of the organization they jointly belong to.<br><br>All of which means that you can't just walk up to the merchants' guildmaster, defeat him in an argument, and now you can push the merchants' guild around. <br><br>It's still in development.

Like how people say "I'll hit you so hard your whole family will feel it"?  Well, there's a wizard with a spell that can hit you so hard, your whole family will die.  If the dice and ability determine the hit dice, then how far ranging the effects will be can also be determined that way. So early on, Cure Wounds can only help one person. Later on, it (or another spell in the same line) can mend the troubles of a whole city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109253/#Comment_109253" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T23:45:48+00:00" title="November 21, 2007 11:45PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>Also, the notion that I cannot even launch an attack against a certain type of creature until I gain a class feature or a certain level is pretty contrary to the way the rest of DnD works.</blockquote>\nI think there's an obvious solution to this issue: Damage Reduction.<br><br>Coupling it with Mike's conceptof a "Handle," you'd get ratings like "Thieves' Guild, DR 10/Law" or "City Government, DR 15/Citizenry."

The kind of gamist "defeat an organization tactically" route you're describing really isn't within the scope of the idea or hard to counteract.  Common sense would dictate that many spells (e.g. Shadowspray) wouldn't work on the organization as a whole -- only on handles to the organization (i.e. individuals.)  This might extend to <em>all</em> spells.<br><br>Running along those lines, particular NPC handles could each "possess" a certain number of the organization's hit point total.  Like, Bob the mid-level Thieves Guild member is worth 10 Thieves Guild hit points out of a total of 200.  Killing or otherwise defeating him does damage to the guild as a whole, but you wouldn't be able to "kill" the Thieves Guild by casting spells on him.  Of course, not all of the Guild hit points would need to be possessed by a handle (the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.)  This would leave room to damage the guild as a whole through action in the courts and what not.  And it leaves room for things like DR 10/Law, which is pretty cool, IMO.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109509/#Comment_109509" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T20:53:32+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  8:53PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2007 9:09PM by Eric.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole elegance and power of this to me is leveraging existing DnD combat into setting-level story: stab the shit out of Hell, as effectively as you can, and figure out what that means in the process. Everything is on the table, everything is up for grabs. As soon as you have minigames within minisystems for actually hurting these organizations and concepts, I think you lose that elegance and power. If the only thing in common between Hell and a demon is that both have HP, then I think we're just using the same word to mean two totally different things. <br><br>I know I can stab, cast spells at, and try to tumble past every creature in the game. Any given sword or spell or tumble attempt might be kinda stupid and inefficient, but the core language of violence is conserved. If we keep that language and extend it to cover more things, the system gets more powerful in its potential application - you potentially get more play out of each rule. If we generate whole new mechanisms to cover more things, then the system is just bigger - more potential play is gained at the expense of more rules and the associated complexity.<br><br>Basically, my ears perk up at the table when I hear I can use [existing thing I understand] to do [surprising new thing]. I'm much less interested at the table when I hear about [whole new system that will have to be explained] that I might be able to use to do [surprising new thing].<br><br>I think stabbing Hell in the face is awesome. I think Glitterdusting the Church of Cyric is awesome, too. They're both more challenging to conceptualize than stabbing a demon or Glitterdusting a cultist, but I think it sounds super-fun to try. My sole concern with that from a design standpoint is making sure that, as quasi-combat encounters, these things have defenses and abilities relevant to what a tactics-heavy, number-crunching group will throw at them.<br><br>edit: you know, you could just take a monster waaaay above the party level and call it your organization.

I think part of the power of this approach is that [whole new system that will have to be explained] has these things going for it:<br><br>1) It's not a whole new system, because<br>2) There are so many parallel concepts, which<br>3) Will make it much easier to explain.<br><br>Hit points won't have to be explained again (much) and neither will Armor Class, Damage Reduction or immunities to certain damage types.  Perhaps this paradigm would mean that characters would have a "social Base Attack Bonus" -- which is new, but also pretty intuitive.  Maybe Diplomacy and Sense Motive and so forth would become "social weapon proficiencies" rather than skills.  Then many of the more generic combat feats would start to have meaning for social combat.  Weapon Focus is pretty straightforward, Power Attack is along the same lines, Weapon Finesse might let you use Int instead <br>of Cha.  The point is that these things aren't new; they're just like the old stuff in a new sphere.<br/><br/>But you could certainly take it in the other direction and let people attack ideas with axes.  And that's cool too!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109599/#Comment_109599" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T20:58:06+00:00" title="November 25, 2007  8:58PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Psssst, Jon...
