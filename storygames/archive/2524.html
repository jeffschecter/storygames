This strikes me as rather likely to run into the "dude, we just discussed that" situation if not worse, but on the very night of signing up, what's to lose?)<br/><br/>So here I am: I think story gaming is really what I strive for in my tabletop play, something I've come to realize more and more over the last few years.  And I've had some great moments that I think live up to the idea.  But here's the problem--they all seem to have occurred in the traditional "pre-game."  That is, from the point of brainstorming off "so we want to play an RPG, but what kind?", on through creating the characters.<br/><br/>People seem to intuitively grasp the idea of a collaborative jam session for the foundational phase of things.  All around, there's light bulbs going on, eyes brightening, laughter and whispers of "awesome" followed by "and then what if it were like this?"  It takes just a little bit of grinding "hmm, I dunno" time, then somebody speaks up with "I've been itching to do spies, but not James Bond, something more human" or whatever... someone else chimes in with their own source of inspiration ("Actual espionage, more cameras than guns.  Information is power."  "Hmm, like that PS2 game <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>?"), the momentum builds, and great things happen!<br/><br/>...But then the night comes of playing out the actual story of those characters and settings, and these walls go up.  People quit looking to each other in a great hot-potato/volleyball exchange of ideas, and turn to the gamemaster.  Suddenly it's right back to that "I dunno" shyness, as if folks just don't think it polite to tell the story as a group: it's "is there...?" and "can I try to...?" rather than stepping up and adding things to the narrative.  And maybe the GM's really on top of things that night and spins a great tale for all--or maybe, more often, not, with whatever sounds good for him echoing against dull disinterest.  The list of games I've seen this happen to makes a whole litany: WEG Star Wars, Exalted, Primetime Adventures, Wushu, Dogs in the Vineyard.  Sometimes it just makes an off night, but sometimes the whole game winds down of it.<br/><br/>So I wonder: what might cause that kind of shutdown once character creation's done?  And if you've experienced such a thing before, how did you break down or get around those walls to let the creativity flow again?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58168/#Comment_58168" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T20:31:20+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  8:31PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually try to address this (as GM) by sticking a nice pointy pin through the belief-baloon that says "The GM has the answers."<br/>\n<br/>\nIf somebody asks me "Is there a garbage bin I can hide behind?"

In Tony's example with the trashcan, I can see the players of my AD&amp;D group going, "But if I can just make up pieces of fiction, I'll make it whatever helps my character the most, and then the fun is gone."  Why is the fun gone?  Because playing for the challenge clashes with having the authority to make the challenges way too easy.<br/><br/>So the players have to make the mental step, if they really want to be playing with a story-focus instead of a challenge-focus, from trying to win to making the story progress.  While there are some players who just want to partake, I do think there are plenty who intuitively and maybe subconsciously believe that, no matter how much collaboration there was in setting up the game, once the game starts, it's them versus the game world and they have to focus on beating it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58272/#Comment_58272" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T09:43:21+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  9:43AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah ...

There doesn't have to be a dichotomy there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can totally give people power to narrate whatever the hell they want in the story, and still have plenty of challenge.  You just have to make sure that narrating what they want in the story is not a challenge-breaking feature.  That's pretty easy if you step outside of a mindset that says "The only challenge we can offer in this game is the challenge of using <b>existing features</b> to best effect."  If, by contrast, the challenge is (for example) "I want to sway more players to my side than are swayed to the other guy's side" (<i>Survivor</i>-style gaming) then the ability to narrate is an important tool, but only a tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58279/#Comment_58279" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:05:10+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:05AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SabreCat</cite>People quit looking to each other in a great hot-potato/volleyball exchange of ideas, and turn to the gamemaster.</blockquote>\nRemove the gamemaster.  Seriously: try out some GMless/GMful games with your group.  Then try some games that split up "GM Tasks" in different ways (ie, Death Stakes, Universalis).  Do it enough and you can deconstruct the central-authority-is-necessary myth.  Then you can go back to games that have a GM/DM/ST/SG/HG/etc, and that player's role will be recontextualized, and the players will realize that in different games they have different responsibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58280/#Comment_58280" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:08:18+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:08AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Christian &amp; Tony:<br><br>While Tony's got a point (in <em>Sons of Liberty</em> you can narrate anything you like but unless it's accompanied by a card play it doesn't actually help you win), I think Christian is talking about a very specific game group ("my AD&amp;D group") with a very specific agenda ("use existing features to best effect").
