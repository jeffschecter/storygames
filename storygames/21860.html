Among my myriad of never finished projects is a powered by the apocalypse game where the players take the roles of the last giants in England and the story that the game is supposed to portray is the tragedy in their extinction. Since the AW forum is really quiet I just thought I'd do a quick check here.<br/><br/>I've put together rules and playbooks, but somehow it feels a bit stale. I think I need some kind of rules bit in the playbooks that reward the players for seeing their characters fail and still generate an interest in interacting with the fictional world and the other characters.<br/><br/>I've put in a <i>Need</i> in each play book, if you trigger it in a session you receive xp, but it seems too little, also it does not make players interact with each other.<br/><br/>We playtested with Strings but it didn't really work. Mostly the sessions were scenes with each Giant on its own, so they had limited impact and when they ran into each other there was no question of not using the strings.<br/><br/>So I'm looking for ideas for rules that engender character/story/world interactions, if I am making myself clear?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477721/#Comment_477721" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-12T12:36:10+00:00" title="November 12, 2018 12:36PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theme first.

Firstly I'd just written a short story about a Giant ravaging an english village, and reveling in its antagonism against people. Secondly I'd found AW and been struck by the insight of antagonistic roleplaying. The players do not have to be part of a team and can have competing agendas so long as we can tell a compelling story. Old news to people here, but I'd been out of RPG:ing for a long time.<br/><br/>So having the players be Giants, each contending with their own issues when small people encroached and their hunger drove them into trouble, seemed to be a nice fit. And making the story a tragedy seemed to fit as well, since I couldn't see a good way out of it.<br/><br/>Now, it could be that AW is a bad fit, it's been 4 years since I started on this project. But I think I'd like to playtest it some more, preferrably with more "hooks" or what I should call it.<br/><br/>I realize I should probably describe where I'm at.<br/><br/>So the setting is roughly 1430 in Bessex (Essex with random settlements). The hundred year war has been cut short ("The four-score war") because alternative timeline ;-) The Giants abide by the old King's law that no Giant may eat a man or cross the county border and the Church sees them as anathema and tries to rally people behind pogroms to kill them off. Hence the dark times.<br/><br/>Essex is divided into roughly 12 areas and every Giant rolls for Hunger at the start of each session, most likely turning the area they are in fallow. This helps in mounting pressure with a steadily decreasing area to engage in.<br/><br/>But tragedy is always better if there is false hope, a bit in line with what you wrote <a href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">@James_Mullen</a>, so I've put together the following playbooks:<br/><br/>The Bond Giant<br/>This is sort of the hard holder playbook. The Bond Giant has sworn to protect a settlement and lives in peace and harmony with its adopted small people. The drama is based on defending the settlement and conflict with the church and/or nobles, as a town with its own Giant might not adopt well to taxation. The need is to protect the people. Having a settlement brings a strong tie to the fiction.<br/><br/>The Exiled<br/>This is sort of the battle babe. It's an exiled Giant from the scottish highlands only really good at fighting and hunted by a nemesis. This Giant has no connection to the land but needs to be on the run due to the nemesis. The drama is based on needing to satisfy hunger and trying to avoid the nemesis and also being moral but forced to break oaths. The need is to resolve the situation by gaining allies in Essex. This playbook has a weak tie to the world but always gets chosen in playtesting<br/><br/>The Provider<br/>I don't really know what to map this with. It's a Giant with a baby, sort of Lone Wolf and cub. The drama is trying to set up a future for the child and the need is to provide a future. This one has tie-ins with other Giants as you have to choose one to be the other parent.<br/><br/>The Shepard<br/>This one is more of the same with a different flavor. You play a Giant doing animal husbandry. Here the drama lieas in the old western trope of cattle drivers vs land owners. The need is to arrange rights of passage and foster a good relation with authorities. Has ties to one of the noble houses.<br/><br/>The Shaman<br/>This is all about the Wyrd stat and foretelling the future (hint: it's dark). Here the drama is based in the conflict between dark magics and the church. The need is to gain power, magical or mundane.<br/><br/>The Sellsword<br/>This is the chopper playbook. You play a Giant back from the war on the continent with a restless and hungry warband on your hands. Here the drama is based on what troubles an idle army can get into and the actions of the authorities. Has ties to one of the noblehouses.<br/><br/>The Beast<br/>This is sort of the gunlugger with a murder hobo bent. Kill, eat, repeat. This is for lone wolf players that revel in being the bad guy. Here the drama is based in "if they say we're bad, we'll be the worst". Has weak ties to the fiction.<br/><br/>Since I figure you play until the Giants have perished when your Giant dies you get to choose one of the advanced playbooks which is either the head of one of the three highest noble families in Essex or the Bishop, meaning it's made for up to five players...<br/><br/><br/>So I guess what I am asking for is good examples or ideas of ways to tie playbooks to the fiction mechanically. And ways to drive the tragedy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477726/#Comment_477726" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-12T15:47:59+00:00" title="November 12, 2018  3:47PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, what's in your playbooks now that isn't tied to the fiction mechanically?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477727/#Comment_477727" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-12T17:21:25+00:00" title="November 12, 2018  5:21PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2018 5:22PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that original thread. Putting all that into the AW splatbook chassis is just hilarious. Yes, I want to figure out whether my giant is a Fighter or Magic-User, yes indeedy-doo...<br/><br/>That aside, assuming you don't have any tragedy-driving mechanics yet, try this one for size:<br/><br/>Have the character players develop "unfinished business" for their characters during character creation. In fact, have them create it for each other, too. Not everything that a character has still left unfinished in their long life needs to be determined at this point - in AW terms you'd probably want to have several Moves that manipulate the concept of unfinished business, allowing players to add to their character background at times. Not too much, but some.<br/><br/>Then, during play, have the GM relentlessly throw any unfinished business that the characters have left at them. Of course you can also mix it up, have another giant's unfinished business show up. It's an excuse for interaction.<br/><br/>The more a character has unfinished, the more tenaciously they cling to existence. Generally speaking every meaningful act in a character's story is a step towards resolving everything that still drives the depreciated concept/lifeform of the giant to remain in England. The melancholy theme is obvious, I imagine.<br/><br/>The tragedy bit here is that all unfinished business is by its nature a reminder of past failure. Prepare to have solid flashback rules, of course, but for the most part your theme should be the twilight of giant-kind, and that means throwing down with the dregs of past mistakes. We're essentially only playing the last act of the tragedy, the one where the mistakes of the past come home to roost.<br/><br/>I imagine that it's obvious what I mean by unfinished business, but a few examples anyway:<br/><b>*</b> The reputation of giant-kind, or the specific wrongs done by a specific giant, have roused a human Hero. The campaign shall see them meet their fate.<br/><b>*</b> Giants came to existence by a mythic Oath that yet lies unfulfilled.<br/><b>*</b> Once, this specific giant Loved. Here are the consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477731/#Comment_477731" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-13T07:48:17+00:00" title="November 13, 2018  7:48AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm rambling along JDCorley.

In my mind I think I was in the territory of either simple rules to put in the playbooks (sort of easier than Hx solutions to drive story between characters) and/or some kind of random table hooks to get players engaged. But Eero's idea is much neater and takes some figuring. Thanks a million!<br/><br/>And as I wrote before, Apocalypse World might not the best way to make this game, but that's where I'm at right now. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477732/#Comment_477732" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-13T11:49:23+00:00" title="November 13, 2018 11:49AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wanted to chime in again, not just to praise what <a href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">@James_Mullen</a> said, nor just to compliment your idea of human factions as the "advanced" playbooks in play <a href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">@Ironjens</a> -<br/>I also wanted to make it clear, I never meant to imply hacking AW was "not the best way to make this game".

From time immemorial, the giants have nurtured humanity, helped them defend against nature's perils when they were weak, taught them about the world, helped to settle their disputes. Now humanity is growing stronger, better, mastering secrets of the world that the giants themselves don't even know. Soon the giants start to be surpassed. They can no longer help the humans, because the humans don't need them anymore. There is a pride of seeing their protegees grow up, but at the same time the sadness of stepping away, letting them live their own lives and no longer feeling needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477881/#Comment_477881" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-18T03:37:58+00:00" title="November 18, 2018  3:37AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An idea I've just had:<br/>Let's say we classify 3 main attitudes towards the era of men: fighting them, letting them take over, trying to help them, and build 3 "damage" tracks (or as many as needed). At the end of every session, another player states how he thinks your character mostly reacted, and you mark the damage track they tell you to. Or perhaps certain fictional conditions make you mark a certain track, though I've found that difficult to keep track of during play. As you come close to fulfilling a track, you approach a certain ending for your story/character. I think my life with Master works in a similar fashion.<br/>I agree there's nothing in particular in the pbta engine that makes it hard to fuel tragedy. For inspiration, I'd read Urban Shadows and it's corruption mechanic, and perhaps also some moves in Sagas of the Icelanders and the pbta game of bunnies whose name I can't recall right now. Both of the last 2 games frame tough choices and consequences into single moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477883/#Comment_477883" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-18T05:23:55+00:00" title="November 18, 2018  5:23AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Night Witches and The Watch are two other PbtA games which do tragedy very nicely (and in very different ways).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477904/#Comment_477904" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-19T14:02:33+00:00" title="November 19, 2018  2:02PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome ideas everyone.
