But around about the time the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egcx63-FfTE" rel="nofollow">trailer</a> for the latest Sherlock Holmes movie came out, I started to have a different approach to the subject. Holmes today is portrayed as a period piece. This is why so many portrayals of Holmes show him in <a href="http://mikecane2008.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/holmes2.jpg" rel="nofollow">dapper,</a> <a href="http://www.seanax.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/PeterCushing_SherlockHolmesTV1968.jpg" rel="nofollow">proper</a>, <a href="http://images.needcoffee.com/dvd/shcollection1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Victorian gentleman</a> instead of a drug user and slob - nobody has ever thought to actually put the chemical stains on his fingers that Doyle did, although the Downey, Jr. dressing-gown is the best version of the dressing-gown we've seen and the unheralded hero of the movie.  It occurred to me that one of the possible reasons for this is because he's the iconic Victorian hero. As a result, we distill into Holmes iconic Victorian values.  This is not fair to the character.  Holmes was not a period piece when he was written - he was a contemporary man, doing highly advanced and unusual things.  If a Holmes story were created today, it would be <a href="http://www.icis.com/blogs/icis-chemicals-confidential/breaking-bad.jpg" rel="nofollow">a crazy but brilliant amateur chemist</a> and a <a href="http://www.arniesairsoft.co.uk/reviews/ak47/three_kings/clooney.jpg" rel="nofollow">disillusioned Gulf War vet</a> taking "the cases the cops won't touch".<br/><br/>So I returned to the Holmes stories and tried to contrast them to the Victorian society that had created them and I really started to see how bold Holmes was as a character for Doyle to create. He helped ordinary citizens who had gotten caught up in bizarre conspiracies. Lestrade and so on were perfectly adequate for normal crime, but some crime stood apart - and so the Holmesian hero stands apart. The same was true of Doyle's other hero, Professor Challenger.  He was ridiculed by academia - only by being separate could he discover the Lost World.<br/><br/>It was identifying this sense of alienation that really helped me get over an obstacle that I had been working on - how to get people to cook up a good character without getting wrapped up in boring Victoriana.  The whole point of Victorian-era heroes is that they broke molds and didn't, couldn't, or refused to fit in and play by the rules.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279139/#Comment_279139" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T13:34:21+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  1:34PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool - I whole-heartedly agree.

Because Holmes may not be perfectly Victorian, but he really <i>is</i> fundamentally English. I mean, the guy invites the person he's trying to arrest over to his parlor for tea. Americans wouldn't even know that murderers like tea.  And there are other great Victorian things from England too, but the really universal stuff that has stuck with us forever, all come at it from outside. Dickens works because he's stabbing Victorian society in the heart, anytime he can't reach the face. But Dickens also celebrates many aspects of English national character and even society.  In fact I see him, and one other fellow who I will talk about momentarily, as two of the big linchpins of getting Victoriana right.<br/><br/>More to come...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279158/#Comment_279158" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T15:34:47+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  3:34PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2010 3:36PM by John_Powell.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the cultural inheritors of Holmes in America are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">Columbo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">Monk</a>, and <a href="http://www.fox.com/house/index1.htm" rel="nofollow">House</a>.

So let's talk about Victorian games of the past:<br/><br/>First, two games that just transplanted themselves into the 19th century:<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu - This had the distinct advantage of having a core story, a simple fallback, Lovecraftian horror transplanted (or replanted, really) in the Victorian age.<br/><br/>Vampire - Again, you just took Vampire and made it Victorian.  I was a little disappointed in this one. Given that the iconic vampire horror tale in Western canon was a contemporary story set in the 19th century, I was hoping for something new, not just a transplantation of Vampire: the Masquerade. Really I had all I needed to run Vampire in Victorian England if I wanted to with the core rulebook.<br/><br/>Then there are some others:<br/><br/>Castle Falkenstein: Although brilliant, there were two things about it that bothered me. The first was that the system was badly messed up. The few times I actually tried to use it I found myself hopelessly lost about what was going on. I never had enough grounding to even make a decent hack of it. GURPS Castle Falkenstein fixed this, marrying the setting to a good system.  However, the outlandishness of the core culture seemed to rub me the wrong way.  This, as it turned out, was due to the reason I discovered above. Try to make a character that stands outside of Castle Falkensteinian society - you can't really, because in a world with magic and dragons and elves and steam machinery, what possible further friction can you create? It's a great adventure game, but there's nothing about it that really scratches my Victorian itch, except of course, the costumes. (Don't knock them, costumes can make you melt. I'll talk about this more shortly.)<br/><br/>Imperial Age: This was a d20 line from Adamant Entertainment. It was really terrific in that it explored a lot of different sorts of Victoriana.  Of course, as with all d20 games (there was eventually a True20 version that was as good or better), you had to bring your own vision of the game to it.  I hope we eventually see more Imperial Age stuff, it was super great. By the by, Imperial Age was the first line to identify India as a crucial, central location for a Victorian age game.  Everyone else, and I do mean everyone, went straight to London and never quite got out.  The conflicts apparent in an India game set in the 19th century should be apparent to all, and quite delicious.<br/><br/>Forgotten Futures: An excellent game, everyone should get it. However, for some reason it never really clicked with me.  I can't really explain why. I think it was because of the way the system was presented? Anyway, good stuff.<br/><br/>The very best Victorian themed stuff out there is GURPS Steampunk and GURPS Screampunk. GURPS Steampunk in particular pointed out that the whole concept of steampunk wasn't necessarily steam powered helipacks and dinosaurs, but instead was the exploration of anxieties and concerns that we in the modern day share in common with the Victorian era.<br/><br/>Victoriana, which I also have, is quite good, though again, with fantastic elements that I felt pulled away from the core of why I would choose a Victorian era game.<br/><br/>Etherscope is an absolutely amazing creation, it's an alternate 1980s, with Victorian science providing the basis for societal changes. However, it's very setting-focused, and I didn't have a clear desire to play in that particular world.<br/><br/>Looking back, there's really only one thing on the above list that is straight up 19th century adventure, and that's the Imperial Age toolkit.  Everything else assumes you're going to want something else, something fantastical, to make the game work. <br/><br/>To some degree, my conclusion above bears this out.  Remember, Holmes solved the most ridiculous, outlandish conspiracies imaginable.  The idea that there's a bigger, darker world outside the circle of our shared social values, and that's where our hero must go, is a recurring theme in Victorian literature.  So calling it the occult, or magic, or horror, or futurist science, that's a natural consequence.<br/><br/>Next up, litrachur!

Thanks to My Secret Pal, who whispered me about it. Yes! Space 1889 was great. One thing it knocked completely out of the park was that it had at its core a question about colonialism. The main problem it had was that in the situations it gave to you, it never really gave you the opportunity to fully explore it. The modules were simple rescues or fetch quests. Blah! Nevertheless the conceptualization was excellent, for what it was (i.e. married to a wargame.)<br/><br/>Full Light, Full Steam, which I see as the spiritual successor to Space: 1889, is a bit more broad in its approach, and of course the concepts of creating characters and the means of introducing their abilities and traits into the story was really innovative. I should have mentioned it too. I haven't gotten a chance to run it yet, but I keep coming back and back and back to it.

But surely, then, they cease to be Victorian at all? If it's set in America, it might be under any one of several presidents for instance. How about a Grover Clevelandian game? Naturally, the point of 'Victorian' is an era is that Queen Victoria ruled for an incredibly long time, giving you a broad span of history to draw upon.<br/><br/>But I really must say that it's strongly possible that the reason many people like Victoriana outside of England is that they are not English. It's a stereotype so please forgive me on this, but America is well-known for its self-interest. That's why so many English shows have a US actor slipped in sideways to make the series sell abroad.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not getting at patriots, and I'm not saying people shouldn't play Victoriana games set in their own countries, or in other people's countries for that matter. All of these seem like pretty decent ideas if properly executed. I'm just saying that blanket statements like X is better than Y are a subjective opinion. I personally see enough of everything set in North America, and would much rather play a game of any nature if it were set anywhere else in the world. It's just easier if it's close to home since I know everyone at the table is likely to be familiar with it.<br/><br/>I also can't help thinking that you have a somewhat romanticised view of what the typical Victorian was like. The perfect Victorian image was an illusion, and the era was positively rife with drug addiction, the rich exploiting the poor, masters who sexually abused their servants, all sorts of depravity. Case in point, baby farming. Heard of that? A well-to-do couple (or people pretending to be well-to-do) would offer to adopt a poor person's child and give it a better life, in exchange for a modest sum of money to pay a few bills. The baby farmers would take the money, then promptly kill the child without the parents' knowledge. The idea of the elegant Victorian gent and his parasol-parading wife being noble and decent was a facade largely put about by the gentry themselves.

I've already mentioned one of my favorite writers, and one I associate strongly with the Victorian period, is Charles Dickens.  For gaming, his early journalism and essay work is almost better than his novels, though many, like Great Expectations, are such classics that they can only improve every creative work you engage in for the rest of your life when you read them.<br/><br/>Here's a Great Expectations story. I'm part of a classics book club, we read Great Expectations. Before the meeting, I was playing Team Fortress 2 on an alltalk server (where everything that's said in in-game chat can be heard by both teams).  I said, "Welp, it was fun, but I have to get going to the book club, we read Great Expectations." The response was some laughter, then someone said, "That was a good book." and someone else said "I liked the blacksmith" and another one said "Estella is super hot" and so on. Now think about this, this book was written literally 150 years ago, but 20-something video-game-playing jerkoffs not only know the story, and like the story, but they have opinions about it and the characters.  That's a story that resonates with the reader.<br/><br/>Anyway, the reason I see Dickens as a key figure in Victorian gaming is because his stories and journalism pieces both have a center.  Great Expectations is about the expectations and desires related to someone's place in society, and everything, <i>everything</i> in the book revolves around that focus.  A Christmas Carol is about the conflict between generosity and self-interest, and <i>everything</i> revolves around that.  Dickens is able to connect even the most disparate and distant ideas to that central focus.  Most importantly, Dickens has a clear point of view that is both celebratory of certain aspects of Victorian-era life and critical of others.  This is something you really want to get across in modern gaming in a historical era. There's no point in having even a semi-historical game without some fidelity to the era - even Xena gets the names right, for example - but at the same time, it's extremely difficult to get a meaningful story out of an exercise in "getting everything right."  Finding a good mixture is often a rough go.<br/><br/>Next post, I will finally get out of England!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284342/#Comment_284342" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T17:29:55+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  5:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, JDCorley, update your fucking thread tonight.

Sorry. We are just about to wrap up this game and it's been amazing.<br/><br/>So the specific thing that led me outside of England was the absolutely super fucking amazing novel Les Miserables by Victor Hugo.  Overshadowed by a pretty decent Broadway show and a couple of movie/miniseries, there is something very special about this novel for me that I've striven for in gaming in a lot of ways for a long time.  If you only know it through the Broadway show or the miniseries or the film, you are in for an amazing treat.  In those productions, there is by necessity, a simple core story that develops over time.  The novel is not like that.  The novel attempts to paint a portrait of a time and place, framed to be sure by several incredibly strong personalities, and experienced by them, but no more exclusive to them than reality itself would be to any of us.  It inhabits France in a way that few novels these days ever inhabit a place.  Even minor characters are often developed - characters are well-developed that never appear "on screen" at all.  Villains are presented with humanity, heroes are presented with flaws, people hesitate when they shouldn't and plunge ahead when they shouldn't.  Bad mistakes, and history, are all made in this novel.  <br/><br/>This is a novel that really makes me wish I'd studied literature in college with professional literature people because it just makes me satisfied in every possible way a novel can.  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/135" rel="nofollow">In all seriousness, read it.</a><br/><br/>It was Hugo and Dickens's big sprawling works that I was able to find a world that I could do a game in.  The values we associate with Victorian England (or France in the Third Republic), are advanced, challenged, supported and undermined throughout these works.  I now had an answer to my wife's question: "Okay, so what do I, a female character, do in your Victorian era game." I now have a road map for what it is like to have someone who challenges some Victorian values while remaining true to others. She doesn't have to be completely "proper", yet can still maintain her propriety in other areas.<br/><br/>And, in Victor Hugo, I had my travel guide to the place where the game would be set: it would be set in <i>Paris</i>.<br/><br/>Right away I knew this was going to do something great for me.  Paris is associated in fiction with passion, in this era of history with uprisings and political turmoil, and in every age with fashion and art.  If I could name a city which could get across to the players the full panoply of upholding or undermining Victorian mores, Paris would be it.<br/><br/>Next, I got a game premise together.  I liked the Dresden Files version of FATE, so I stripped it down a little (reduced the number of Aspects, eliminated most of the more powerful Powers), and decided to go with that.  I remembered that I had obtained back in the day a d20 pulp game set in a Paris subsumed in eternal, magical darkness. That game, the sadly defunct Forbidden Kingdoms, would provide me with some of the personalities, as well as some of the supernatural dangers.<br/><br/>The characters the players made with great.  And they followed my instructions to the letter:<br/><br/>Your Aspects tell us why you can't put your brilliant talents to work for the government, society, or some established firm - they tell us why you stand outside of polite society and cannot advance there.  <br/><br/>The examples I gave were things like "No one could expect a Muslim to be rewarded for his efforts" or "if I were a man, I could make those fools listen to my theories!"<br/><br/>There were four characters:<br/><br/>A former grifter who turned stage magician when it became "too easy" to get people to give him their money, then retired from the stage for the Bohemian life in Montmartre when stage magic became too easy (not to mention somewhat supplanted by the possibility of real magic.)  His Trouble Aspect, as I mentioned in another thread, was "How did they DO that?"  Like Holmes, Robert was motivated by the challenge of figuring out apparently impossible theatrical feats. <br/><br/>A bastard son of Russian nobility who had incredible strength and an amazing willingness to help out.  "Da, no problem, I do it." was his Trouble Aspect.  This is the same aspect Rudolf Rassendyll has in the Prisoner of Zenda.  A decent story, a chance for adventure and suddenly he's in it up to his neck.<br/><br/>A psychic archaeologist woman whose husband and entire expedition disappeared, with her the only survivor, and many questions lingering about her involvement.  "The wrong side of faith" was what she had.  The Church blamed her involvement in "advancing pagan rituals", which to her was completely academic.  She also had a partnered career with her husband that had allowed her to advance in academia, but which now was not just missing, but actively a drag.  I didn't have a specific hero or heroine in mind for this, but it is a bit Dickensian for her to come so far arm in arm with someone and then, through no fault of her own, she is torn from the life she knew and now sees it from the outside.<br/><br/>A young astral projector from America who can read people's dreams to learn their secrets, sent to Paris to live with her weird spiritualist aunt.  Her Trouble aspect was "I know what you did".  The implication being that she could learn what people did in secret by rummaging through their dreams. This directly implicates the "proper" classes of society in hypocrisy, perfect for a Victorian game.<br/><br/>Interesting notes on these four characters: None were native to Paris.  There were 2 Americans, a Russian and an Englishwoman.  They wanted to discover Paris as their characters did, although they'd been there for a few months and wouldn't hail a cab with the wrong color lantern on, there still were streets and neighborhoods they didn't know, not to mention the countryside.<br/><br/>I looked at their spread and noticed some areas of culture they hadn't gone into: radical politics, religion, and so on.  So I introduced NPCs - an Opus Dei-style Vatican operative, a radical anarcho-feminist novelist, and the spiritualist aunt was elected as my "uptight Victorian lady", though of course she had her own eccentricities related to her advancement of the "new science".  I really tried to emphasize that the values that were in upheaval were in upheaval everywhere.   This really engaged the players.  The Russian guy being seduced by the novelist was both hilarious and really in-character for both of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293062/#Comment_293062" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T08:36:46+00:00" title="September 12, 2010  8:36AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because it came up in another thread, people were asking, how do you juggle all those Aspects, especially when NPCs are in the mix?<br/><br/>First of all, most NPCs only have 1-2 Aspects, one of which is their Concept and another of which is their current motivation for doing things (this can be found out by Robert with one of his stunts after a minute of talking to them, and used to player advantage.) Most don't have Fate chips. However, fully developed NPCs have a full slate of Aspects just like the player characters, a refresh rate, and so on.<br/><br/>It's pretty simple to keep track of, so long as you put the important NPCs directly in the characters' paths. For example, Robert faced off against a maniacal assassin who used elaborate stage productions to kill his victims. His Trouble Aspect was "I'm smarter than you." As you can see, this Aspect is in direct conflict with Robert's "How did they DO that?" aspect. As soon as I paid Robert a chip to dive into the affairs of this assassin, I had a clear systemic line between Robert pushing one way and the assassin pushing the other.<br/><br/>It wasn't just enemies: the anarcho-feminist novelist's Trouble Aspect was "smash the bosses and the superstitious frauds in the church!" Put that with "Da, no problem, I do it" and you've immediately got a back-and-forth that challenges the player and character as to what they'll do for some of that sweet, sweet free lovin' that she wants to hand out.<br/><br/>The Aspects in this game could give some mechanical weight to Victorian things too. Aunt Henriette had one that was "I am a <i>truly</i> proper woman", when society thought of her as nothing of the sort, the player characters could get mileage out of playing on Henriette's at least partly incorrect self image.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293097/#Comment_293097" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T12:42:43+00:00" title="September 12, 2010 12:42PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2010 12:43PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once I got the players to engage with the characters <i>as challenges</i> to the Victorian mold, they were more able to identify with and pursue the interests of their characters, and even to defend 19th century conservative values when it fit their characters to do so.  For example, although the astral projector girl didn't see anything wrong with being courted by a fop who led a claque (fuck claques, they ruined theater for 200 years), when he turned his "wit" against her conservative aunt, she got outraged on Henriette's behalf and sent him on his way with a scathing rebuke suitable for any corset-wearing comedy of manners. <br/><br/>So I think the key to making this particular historical game work for me was identifying how to get across to the players the broadness, the places to stand outside the historical moment as normally portrayed, so that if there was something in the historical moment they needed distance from in order to identify with their characters, they could take that distance without hurting the game.<br/><br/>And of course, this really let me read a ton of French 19th century fiction, which led me to a Smallville rules bolt-on that I'm going to post in another thread.<br/><br/>Questions! Comments! Let's have 'em.
