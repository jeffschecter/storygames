Or, rather, worlds. Well, to be accurate there were worlds, but now there is just one. The Sundering obliterated the barriers that kept the planes separated, causing them all to collapse into a single dimensional space. Where two planes collided often only one came out on top, but some more or less merged, creating a clashing of realities. <br/>The gods and primordials are responsible for life, the universe, and everything. Before the Sundering both sides created many things, both people and places, both intentionally and accidentally. The god of dwarves crafted them from stone and taught them how to work metal, and dwelled within a great mountain. When the ice primordial was slain winter wolves, elementals, cryohydras and more sprang forth from its blood, which eventually formed a great glacier that slowly grows even now.<br/>However...<br/>There are no more gods or primordials. Probably. Legend has it that they were all wiped out before or during the Sundering, and both their angels and dormant corpses drifting through the Astral will certainly testify to that fact. Clerics are still around, as they can draw faith from angels, a god\u2019s corpse, or even from themselves: their sheer faith is enough to make miracles happen. That being said, maybe one or two are hiding out somewhere...<br/>A lot of mundane critters were either wiped out, or do not operate entirely like you would expect. Astral whales swim through the silvery expanse with ease, as do fish despite there being a lack of water. Or, maybe they are made of water. Or infused with divine power. Think about where they came from and what happened: deer may be the children of a stag spirit, while certain birds might have been affected by the plane of death and now crave souls.<br/>Ultimately this is your Sundered World. The fragments of information in here are intended to help you build your own world of scattered islands, god-corpses, and forgotten secrets for adventurers to discover and explore. They might fend off a hoard of gnolls on carrion-ships, they might explore the ruined dominion of a god that, they might liberate a village from the harsh auspices of an angel that has taken its dogma too far."<br/><br/>If you liked what you read feel free to join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/104949862250224587046" rel="nofollow">G+ Community</a> or you can read about more on <a href="http://daegames.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">this blog</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan" title="DavidSchirduan"><img alt="DavidSchirduan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan">DavidSchirduan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440311/#Comment_440311" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-21T12:26:03+00:00" title="November 21, 2014 12:26PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Melissa!

You will get more discussion going if you ask a specific question, especially related to game design.<br/><br/>So for example:<br/><br/>Creating a world where beliefs directly impact reality: How do I set rules in a world where the rules change constantly?<br/><br/>That is a question that can be discussed, but an info dump doesn't really trigger much of a spark on here.
