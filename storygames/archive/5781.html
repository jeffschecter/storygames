I disagree.  Everything there was criticism.  Everything seems genuine and honest, save possibly for Mike comment about Polaris.  That looked like an off-color joke to me.  The dictionary says that criticism can be defined as the act of passing judgment on the merits of anything.  You don't have to like it and it doesn't have to be valuable to you to be criticism.</p>\n<p>I mention the dictionary definition of criticism because I want to be on the same page as you when we talk about it's place here.  If you want to specificially talk about the value of different forms of criticism, then that's cool with me.  But please do not tell someone that a word doesn't mean something when it does.  I would like to avoid dead-end semantic arguments.</p>\n<p>So, let's talk about criticism.  Specifically, criticism of RPGs, both homebrew and studio built.  Is it appropriate here at Story Games?  Should there be a line drawn somewhere in the sand?  Is one form of criticism ok here and another not?  If so, which is which?</p>\n<p>Personally, I'd like to see any and all criticism up to name calling to be groovy here.  I'm cool with you telling me that you think my game sucks.  I don't care what part of my game you pick on.  You could tell me that my art sucks, my layout sucks, my rules suck, my grammar sucks, or my subject material sucks.  I just don't want to hear you telling me that I suck because of the game I wrote.  That's too far in my book.</p>\n<p>I want this all laid out and in public.  Mike just got bashed real bad for talking about games.  He didn't even say that they were bad games.  He was just pointing out some things that he saw as less than perfect.  Which is the same thing I did.  Which is the same thing that everyone there was doing.  We were pointing out the imperfections we saw.  Can we do that at Story Games?  Or will every thread where someone wants to talk about the things they don't like get shut down by someone accusing them of ruining their day?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129534/#Comment_129534" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T18:24:55+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            a) I'm not sure that Mike got <em>bashed</em>.

Let's not escalate this beyond what it is.<br/><br/>b) I think there's a big difference between criticism in general and formal criticism such as book reviews and whatnot.  I, for one, don't really want to see book reviews here.  There are other, better venues for that.<br/><br/>c) Criticism has an undeserved negative connotation.  As you point out, criticism is passing judgment on the merits of something.  That judgment can be that the something has merit.  Criticism can be positive -- and we have that already here.  The thing that gets me is that when criticism only ever comes out on the "merit" side and doesn't touch on the flaws.  That's intellectually dishonest.  It's whitewashing.  It's lame.  All I want is balanced information: the good and the bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129535/#Comment_129535" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T18:25:29+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:25PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, six months ago, I wrote the following: <br/><br/>So I'm going to start doing some game reviews. I'm going to start with Dogs. <br/><br/>I'm doing Dogs first for several reasons. First, I've now been playing the game for years and have played dozens of sessions with dozens of different people, and have talked with a lot more people about the game. I feel I have a good handle on what the game does, how it does it, and what the strengths and weaknesses of the game are. I feel that I can really review the game critically and honestly, and have a good chance of being accurate and possibly even insightful in what I say. <br/><br/>Second, its well known that I love Dogs. I've repeatedly gushed and raved about it, and so everyone knows about where I stand on it. I think it is a very strong game, and I want to talk about why that is in detailed terms -- sort of creating a bar for discussion. However, I also don't think it is a perfect game, and there are some issues with it that I will be talking about. This too is a bar for discussion. <br/><br/>Which leads to the third reason: there are many ways in which the future reviews are going to build off of the Dog's review. I won't just be reviewing games in isolation, I will be comparing them to each other and talking about how they reflect, progress, or assume upon conventions and paradigms of game design. This is because, in my not humble opinion, reviews should be more that "do/do not buy" guides or lists of one liners and snark designed to show how clever the reviewer is or how in with the crowd and down with the hotness they are. Good reviews should help form a community of discourse that can help consumers find the right material, but also to help push and spur the community and designers. They should also give enough material for consumers to decide on their own about a game, rather than looking to the numerical score so as to rely on the judgment of others as to the report card grade of a game. <br/><br/>I have to admit I've been spurred in this by several recent articles about book reviews and their import. From <a href="http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2007/05/save_book_revie.html" rel="nofollow">Salman Rushdie talking about the importance of book reviews with Stephen Colbert</a> to my personal reflections about Walter Pater, to opinion pieces about <a href="http://believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=article_julavits" rel="nofollow">what's gone wrong with reviews</a>, there has been much entering my mind of late about the way that reviews and criticism, when done right, are actually constructive and promoting of a community. I do not think that the majority of RPG reviews in the past have come up to that level. Some have, and there are a small handful of people whose work I will be using as inspiration, but looking back on my own work in reviews in the past I'm disappointed. I want to do something better. Maybe I fall on my face, maybe not. <br/><br/>So... first: Dogs. After that I'll try to do one or two a month. Beast Hunters and Polaris will probably be the next couple, with TSOY and Trollbabe coming close after. <br/><br/>Now we all know I never actually finished that. My computer crashed. I cried for a month. <br/><br/>But despite my personal, brutal, public failure -- I still stand behind that as a guide to what criticism is, can be, and can do. It also stand behind it as a guide to the fact that good criticism is not easy, and it is different than just saying good or bad things about games. <br/><br/>Though hell, saying good and bad things about games is just honesty sometimes. And I've got no problem with honesty. You can do "honest first blush" in 15 seconds, but real, informed, reasoned criticism takes more than that. <br/><br/>Seriously, check out the links above. They give some real food for thought about the place of criticism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129537/#Comment_129537" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T18:28:36+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:28PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read Mike's post, and laughed a lot.  I think there's a lot of value in the sort of reaming Mike gave those games, even if the criticism is "unfair" or "heavy handed."  They weren't particularly useful to me, because I haven't played those particular games, but I'm familiar with reviews in that style, and I can enjoy a good ranty, frothing at the mouth review of even my most beloved old warhorses.  <i>Especially</i> if the author is going off about some element in the game that drives me batty.  It's that feeling John was talking about, the confirmation that you "aren't taking crazy pills."<br/><br/>I'm a smart guy, and I can salt a review to my tastes.  I look at Mike's reviews, and I think "salt heavily."  Other people write very nuanced, fair-minded and detailed review.  "Salt lightly."  Reviews done in the style that Mike did his reamings are sort of the opposite of gushing fan boys reviews, and when triangulated with a few other reviews, I can start getting a real idea about how the game is going to play.  For Sorcerer, as an example, I might read few gushing raves, a few rants, and a well-rounded review, and I'll get an idea of not only how the game works and what it's for, but where the "Rock On!" comes from, and when the "Fucking Argh!" is going to set in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129541/#Comment_129541" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T18:34:45+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 6:35PM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>a) I'm not sure that Mike got <em>bashed</em>.

It's a way of saying, "This is far from what it should be."<br/><br/>Disagreeing with someone's critique is not "shutting them down." It's an honest response to something offered for public consumption. Which I thought was the thing we are all rallying for in the first place. But I would never suggest that Mike (or anyone) shut up or censor themselves, or that anyone needs to defend a work from criticism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129653/#Comment_129653" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T04:54:03+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  4:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 4:56AM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>John,</p>\n<p>That's not what you said about the criticism in that thread.

A criticism of the criticizers, basically. Like going "You want criticism? I got yer criticism right here!" Complete with crotch grabbing. I mean he started out like so:\n<blockquote>Recently there's been this claim that people don't criticize RPGs openly or honestly enough around here. And then there was some talk about how to be nice about it. Screw that.</blockquote>\nCome on, doesn't that look like an invitation for a status fight? Did I miss the part where the criticism was aimed at making the games better? That said his rants tickled me. I'm not criticizing Mike. I found myself laughing at some points (OK, a couple times I wanted to punch him in the eye, but mostly laughing). But I think the thread worked as intended. I don't really see how his RPG reaming thread has lots to do with the calls for the New New Honesty.<br/><br/>So yes, the thread got derailed. I think that was probably inevitable.<br/><br/>EDIT: and just to make the post more germane to your question, I don't think negative or positive is the issue. I think that criticism is most effective when it is worded in such a way as to maximize communication. Criticism that is structured to bruise egos and make designers defensive and cause strife is pretty worthless if your goal is to have a constructive impact on a game. Its great if your goal is to make some kind of statement about yourself, or about the community. I, however, would prefer that folks focus on improving games when they give a critique and make other statements in some other form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129937/#Comment_129937" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T09:52:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  9:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric P.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you're reading me wrong.  Or at least partly wrong.  I'm loathe to reiterate what I've already said several times already, but since those statements are scattered around several threads I'll try a brief summary.<br/>\n<br/>\nNegative criticism is good and healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmtional loaded barbs have zero utility.  They do not function to help make the game better.  They do not function to help the designer learn to design better.  They also aren't necessary for warning consumers of low quality product.  A fine, non-emotional deconstruction of a games flaws sans "What the Hells?" can do that just fine.  They do not have any benefit at all...except to garner attention for the critic...THAT'S not honest constructive criticism.  That's at best pointless ribbing, and at worst gross self-aggrandizement and cheap entertainment for the reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cries for harder hitting critique are well placed.  I'll note that at Forge Midwest 2007 I was one of the louder voices calling for exactly that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's a difference between hard hitting critique and just taking the piss out of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormer, good...latter, poison.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The primary complaint was that the background chronology was too long...at 28 pages (and small pages at that).  I read more than 28 pages of historical non-fiction (the ultimate "background chronology" while sitting on the toilet this morning,  I would have enjoyed seeing this section expanded to 50 or 60 pages because its also chock full of awesome hooks and story ideas.  So clearly this is not any sort of problem just a "what I like" post.

That is, I was being criticized for why I was critiquing, not that I was critiquing. <br>\n<br>\nWhich, given my reasons for the thread, and how I was doing it, I should have been bashed for. I agree that the cause of the thread sucked. That was, in fact, the point. <br>\n<br>\nAll of the criticisms I gave were true, if not well written. I was shorthanding horribly, in order to get in more games. Each criticism could get it's owhn thread, easily. Even my comment about Polaris was just an attempt at creating a zen-like understanding of my real problems with the game. As awfully done as it was. <br>\n<br>\nI don't think that anyone disagrees that there should be criticism. They may have said that bad criticism is a bad idea - can't argue with that. Or that criticism for status is a bad idea. Can't disagree with that, either. But that's not the same as saying that we should not criticize. Nobody said that, nor would they. <br>\n<br>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130249/#Comment_130249" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T11:24:46+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 11:24AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are so many Criticism Criticism Etc Etc threads going on right now, I'm not sure where the best place for this is, so I'm just going to plonk it down right here.

The implications are I don't criticize games I have never played, I always ground my statements with a "in my experience" and always give specific examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I do have the view that in a limited sense bad experiences are the "Fault" of the game. For example, if I read the rules, play the game, the experience turns out poorly, and someone else tells me I played the game "wrong" and that's why I didn't have fun, then I blame the rules for not being written sufficiently clearly to induce fun play. So in this sense, I am MORE likely to criticize games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130306/#Comment_130306" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T14:10:05+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  2:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you do that do you allow for possibility of personal baggage and gaming habits being a contributing factor?

I attended a talk he was giving at the game developer conference down here in Austin a couple of years ago, and he managed to insert a mini-rant about "the new crop of indie narrativist games" into the middle of a presentation on cell phone games. I know he's familiar with many of the Forge-type titles, and I'm sure that the stuff that has been happening in these parts has an influence on his design thinking, which then flows back out to others. Baby steps, but it's heartening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
