I've given WFRP3 a thorough reading, made a couple characters, messed with combat and the dice and stuff. Neat, neat game. The dice system is very smart; Ralph's already done an outstanding job of laying out its strengths. It's definitely fussy with all the bits and bobs; I'm curious to see how it feels with other human beings managing those bits.<br/><br/>So anyway, a LOT of nu-skool design touches really jumped out at me. Here's what I've got so far.<br/><br/>* Progress tracks: As they're applied to the Party Sheet, it's pretty much Lacuna-style Static. Players do unspecified things, GM makes a cryptic note about it by increasing a counter. I've been thinking you could draw some incredibly interesting conflict-y play out of simply re-engineering the Party Sheet mechanic. Like...right now, basically it's a peer-pressure-juiced punishment -- dick around too long, and you'll be responsible for inflicting stress and fatigue on everyone at the table. But ... what if you had OTHER effects fire off at specific Party stress points? Everyone gains a Fortune! Everyone gains a free Maneuver! The party may call for an Interlude/Recess RIGHT NOW. Every player may now submit a new Goal for this Episode. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>* Goals: Yeah, these are totally Mouse Guard style goals. It's too bad there's not some economy facilitating them... Thinking the Party Sheet gets fed a Fortune every time a player pursues his stated goal. Now it's Artha! <br/><br/>* Say Yes/Prenegotiated Consequences. Holy shit, it made the big time. I'm pretty jazzed about the way they've sort of stealthily slipped this in. This aesthetic is even present in the dice vocabulary: crossed swords aren't "failures," they're "challenges." I think this works really nicely as-is: hand out misfortune, apply a Condition, inflict some in-the-fiction consequence, but make sure the player buys in before the roll. Yessss.<br/><br/>* Yes and/but; No and/but: This is lovely. I'm glad there are already boon/bane complications cooked into the action cards. It's mechanically sound; it probably really pops when you tie the mechanical consequence hard into the ongoing fiction.<br/><br/>* Slow, steady Advances aren't really doing it for me. Ralph mentioned there's a way to individually reward players but I can't find that yet. I assume that's in the Tome of Adventure?<br/><br/>Stuff I wish there was a bit more guidance on:<br/><br/>* How to build Progress tracks. I get why and when, but the actual budget for them is hazy. In all the examples, they typically tie the track length into someone's stat. I think that ought to be mechanized, even if it's as light as "the GM decides which stat builds the Progress track." Right now it kind of isn't, so it feels arbitrary.<br/><br/>More later.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247600/#Comment_247600" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-19T11:41:52+00:00" title="December 19, 2009 11:41AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thre is no budget for Progress Tracks.

There is variety between the tracks but its largely variations on fatigue or stress.  I'd thought of an idea for X-men-esque squabbling...where you WANT the players to be bitchy with each other.  So you award fortune and stressin alternate steps.  Or a Bruce Willis / Rocky Balboa -esque track where there is a big Boss-monster-slaying reward at the end of the track but you have to eat a bunch of fatique every step to get there...and make sure you don't get there too soon and waste it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it would be a little harder to make the track work with competing interests.

Its not an advancement reward though.  IIRC its advice on awarding players with Fortune for "Good Roleplaying" and the usual assortment of things that traditional games would award XPs for other than killing monsters.  RAW, you're stuck with the auto advances.  I am rather surprised they don't mention the possibility of accelerating the advances so you can see the career system at work in a "mini campaign" framework of "merely" 10 sessions.  The other Advance rule I'm not a fan of is the rule that you only get to keep your special "career power" (the one that has its own card) if you complete the career (stay in it long enough to get all of the advances).  Since there's already advice on restricting career swapping to fictionally meaningful choices putting an arbitrary restriction that would cause people to miss the cool power if they follow the cool fiction seems like a poor choice to have to make off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247730/#Comment_247730" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T05:13:34+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  5:13AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM's flexibility in awarding Fortune dice allows quite a bit of steering this way or that for game flavour.  It could be "you get them when you're good at narrating exciting results by reading the dice types and where success/failure boon/bane comet/star came from" or "you get them when you hit your goal/key etc.".  Ditto the extra XP beyond the one per session.  The fact they go into the Party Pool is a nice way to avoid that being more player neutral than handout things that "free form" sometimes feel.<br><br>The mechanic of Fortune cycling "per game session" struck me as an interesting nod to the real world, whatever else is going on, in the real world you show up to have fun, here's three Fortune dice to have fun with this session and XP to advance with, beyond that it's up to you.<br><br>The flexibility of time to conform to the narrative flow was one of the toughest things for me to get my head around till I saw the sidebar in Tome of Adventure being clear that "in a wide-lens" mode, 1 round could be 1 day and "close range" could be same building, with medium same neighbourhood etc.  <br><br>I can see doing a quasi-Mouseguard duel of wits with the progress tracks for a social conflict, the mid-point being "a concession" and the end-point being "argument conceeded".  So to win hands-down you need to advance to end-point without foe advancing to mid-point etc., the rules pretty much imply that I think.<br><br/>Rob                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247836/#Comment_247836" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T11:21:52+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:21AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so we made three characters and had a VERY quick throwdown. Stuff that jumped out at me:<br/><br/>* The Party Sheet may be even more of a killer app than the dice system. We've arrived at WFRP3-style results via other die methods before, so it's novel but not revolutionary to load them all onto funky custom dice. We do like them, though, and got pretty facile at building the pool quickly. But the Party Sheet! Yes! Making everyone decide the character of their party is huge GMing help. My guys chose Glory Hounds, so now I know that if glory's on the line, they'll go after it. I pay Fortune into the party's pool when they do that, but even w/o the scooby snak they're still ready and willing to play toward their Party Sheet. It's neat.<br/><br/>Socketing abilities into the Party Sheet is hot, but also MMMMAYBE broken. Need to play it more. There are some, uh, really awesome talents that don't exhaust and provide staggeringly useful benefits. I'm sure it's just a matter of GMing toward that, and fiating up the challenge a bit to match the talent.<br/><br/>* Action card selection is painfully vague. The FAQ -- which we didn't really study 'til after the session -- clarifies that you can play "reaction" cards any goddamned time and they're not counted as your action. Gosh that would have been nice to include in the rulebook.<br/><br/>But worst of all is the utter lack of guidance regarding action card Traits. Sometimes they mentioned a rank -- that one is explained in the character creation rules. Sometimes they mention an Order or a College; we have to *infer* that you're stuck choosing from the correct Order or Cult -- there is no mandate. Worse still are some of the traits attached to the action cards from the Adventurer's Toolkit. "Ancestor" and "Way of the Sword"? No rules I can see. We're just guessing that the High Elf Swordmaster is the guy who gets access to Way of the Sword cards. Ancestor, I have no idea. Have to look back through the professions and see if one jumps out.<br/><br/>* Does anyone know what a character's "maximum Fortune" is? Can that number increase? I'm *assuming* it's 3, since that's the top-of-session refresh. But in the Fortune rules, when you pay the party off the Party Sheet, if you already have "maximum Fortune" you leave your chit on the sheet (thereby making future recharges happen faster). So, WTF. <br/><br/>* All in all there's a surprising amount of procedural looseness to the game that isn't apparent from reading. Took us 30 minutes to figure out that "Weapon Skill (St) vs. Target Defense" doesn't mean you match up, say, your St vs. his Ag. The phrase "Defense" is defined only in reference to NPC critters and armor rules. Other looseness: How much damage you actually do in a hit -- soak is implied but never defined, and the fact you add your St and the weapon's damage is also sort of obliquely referenced. Or the fact that exhausting a talent means putting precisely 4x markers on the card, which is mentioned only once. It all added up to kind of a frustrating first go.<br/><br/>But anyway! More nu-skool touches and upgrades in WFRP3!<br/><br/>* I'm thinking there's a lot of cleverness to be had with the Progress Track mechanism, but it's ultimately very fiat-y. Not terrible, and a possibly useful tool for GMs to illustrate progress, but the Progress Track mechanism is very much an invitation for DIY wannabe game designers. I'd like to see Progress Track recipes posted up somewhere.<br/><br/>* I think there's a lot of potential uses to passing around arbitrary stress and fatigue markers -- manipulating that economy is both RAW and probably the right way to address individual players. It appears that ALL fortune markers go straight to the Party Sheet, while individual Fortune Dice can go straight to a player. That's sort of interesting, since the die is (slightly) less useful than the marker.<br/><br/>* The story/encounter mode split is nice, although I wish there was a bit more structure to how and when a rally phase takes place. There's also some weirdness to some of the rally phase effects: Like, under what circumstances would you "change the initiative order" during a rally phase? I must've missed something. Thinking about a MG-style Player Turn that's possible during an Encounter Phase -- like, amongst the standing choices (free maneuver, recover from damage or stress, etc.), you can also "pursue my written goal" (and earn a Fortune for the party sheet!) and open up like a little side scene for yourself. Maybe at the cost of a rally phase afterward? Not really sure.<br/><br/>Kind of running dry at this point. I'll need lots more play to see what the game does well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247840/#Comment_247840" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T11:38:49+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:38AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Ancestor, I have no idea.

Maybe someone who rolled badly decides to reroll (assuming they've nothing more pressing to do from the options available).  <br/><br/>It would have been nice if the Rally list of options was on back of a rulebook like the dice symbols.<br/><br/>The rules layout is somewhat confusing, yes which is interesting given the amount of effort spent using cards to make rules-look up not necessary.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248083/#Comment_248083" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T10:41:15+00:00" title="December 22, 2009 10:41AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 10:41AM by PaulB.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>FAQ updated today answers this, traits are not limits.

I take that in part as them saying, "when the Advanced Career comes out with its career card and more actions and it turns out you didn't get the synergies benefits etc., Mr. Dwarf doing the Elf Dance thing, don't come complaining to us.!"<br/><br/>My own thoughts generally on traits:<br/><br/>- I would be suggesting that some things should be restricted as suggested but not all by trait (that actually is broken if you compare traits and all careers) and restriction could simply be narratively explain you were among elves for a bit etc.  So not only waywatchers are permitted to take Bullseye - but this is an example how synergies are more than trait based.  Sure despite 'watcher' trait a human hunter can take it.  But, will the human hunter have had starting 3 Agility (governing characteristic), increased automatically to 4 for class, and bonus on Stealth in Woods to be hidden which is a prerequisite situation to use the Action?  Part of what the trait is saying "hey, if you're playing a waywatcher, check this one out, might be tasty for you".<br/><br/>- I say "suggesting" above because I dislike the way FFG materials keep saying "the GM can change this" -- constant references to "GM ownership of game" irk me a bit.  "Table can change this for their game" would be my preference.  Pet peeve and yeah I realize lots of tables except the GM to be a dictator.  Yes, this game expects lots of GM adjudication on fly, that's fine and I think it's designed well for that, but that doesn't require GM hold reins on rules etc.<br/><br/>As to point of profession:  career card special ability, shaping advancement (you want to pick up weapon skill and increase wounds, pick one of those careers; you're tired of being illiterate and want more skills like Education, pick one of those careers), also depending on style of game I think it has lots of narrative potential from shaping starting character concept through to what is going on in PC's life as it goes on.  Not if the game is "every week of in-game-time another adventure, in which case "what suddenly you're a rat catcher? is odd" but if it assumes downtime between adventures there's a natural "well, my coachman having seen all the difficulties travellers face became a roadwarden" or "my waywatcher spent a long tour supporting himself on long range scouting missions, so became a hunter, though still is considered a waywatcher by his tribe" or "remember that noble we impressed, I'm now one of his agents (or bailiffs, or bounty hunters)".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249125/#Comment_249125" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T09:17:21+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  9:17AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I've gotten in a couple honest-to-goodness WFRP3 sessions now. Game's pretty cool but all the oldskool tradness is hard work! I'd almost forgotten about shit like prep time. Thankfully the game doesn't require that I set target numbers as well, or I'd be a basketcase.<br/><br/>I've noticed that a really common dissatisfaction I'm having with dice interpretation is when you end up with a single boon or bane and have nothing designated to spend it on. Many cards, and of course the two default choices, require 2x symbols. But getting 1x is pretty common! That got me thinking about narrative authority a bit.<br/><br/>Next game I think I'm gonna do this:<br/><br/>If you succeed and end up with a single boon or bane, narrate to us the boon/bane element. How did you end up advantaged/disadvantaged beyond your intent? Get a Fortune die for your next roll if you narrate in your stance as well.<br/><br/>If you fail and end up with a single boon or bane, I will narrate to you how you are now advantaged/disadvantaged beyond the failure itself. Grant a Fortune die to your next roll to reflect your slight advantage.<br/><br/>Mmmmaybe pull a MG-type trick in which a fail + bane = a new complication for you to deal with (choosing from wilderness/city, weather, monsters or men).<br/><br/>Anyway, just my latest thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249131/#Comment_249131" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T09:49:08+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  9:49AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2009 9:51AM by Valvorik.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Do you find the "location card" based rather than "map based" lets you prep easier?  I imagine creating sand-boxes etc. much easier with this approach.<br/><br/>I can see the single boon/bane thing.  There are a number of action cards and talents that do let stuff happen on a 'single".  Out-of-box I see that as a bit of a "game mastery" thing at least for the boons in that a clever Player may have an eye for picking talents that help you on a single boon (slot that to the party card and everyone's golden!) - for example there's one that recovers 1 stress on single boon, a good talent for any mental-action focused character.<br/><br/>In one way you can also look at that as simply this game's "missing by 1" or "one short of critical" or "one die in the die pool" in other systems, one is really zero. Though if you want to "maximize the narrative from every dice set" I can see wanting more.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be more in keeping with boon/bane principle (which is that boons and banes are still each independently of succeed or fail) to have it:<br/><br/>- Player narrate something tasty on the single boon (for prompts look at the list of things granting fortune), and it carries into your next action or an engaged ally's as a fortune die<br/><br/>- if GM can narrate something tasty on a single bane (likewise for prompts look at the list of things granting misfortune), it carries into next action against you as a misfortune die (or perhaps even against an engaged ally, which might be worth 1 on the Party Tension meter as he curse you for fouling his parry, "you git" [to quote one card with that sort of outcome])<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249134/#Comment_249134" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T09:57:35+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  9:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, yeah, that's a cleaner approach. I had two ideas going at once but the "narrate the boon/bane and gain a (mis)fortune die" is really the better part of it.<br/><br/>OTOH it's been a proven, effective method to allow players to narrate their own misfortune (esp. if the system supports it in some way). As often as not they'll narrate in something truly heinous, way beyond what any sensitive GM might try to inflict. I like that. So that's an idea worth circling back to.<br/><br/>Hm. There's also the issue of keeping all the various options and threads straight in one's head when the dice actually hit the table. <br/><br/>Okay. New thought:<br/><br/>Whether the character succeeds or fails, the player gets to narrate the consequence of a single boon or bane. Narrating their own bane puts a Fortune marker on the party sheet and adds a misfortune die on their next roll; narrating their own boon earns them a fortune die on their next roll. And recommend looking at the (mis)fortune list for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249138/#Comment_249138" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T10:05:13+00:00" title="December 30, 2009 10:05AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New thought nice, in player do narration either way.  <br/><br/>Dangle carrot for nice banes to pump Fortune has a certain "flow to it" (yes, party Fortune may refresh faster this way, but it will do that because of extra misfortune dice and in what works out to be the same number, 3 player party and 3 misfortune dice this way, there's 3 fortune to distribute).

Do a good job of describing that/making it relevant and it might be 3 that time as GM rewards you; (b) for other free-formed ones, once again let people do that and if they apply it in entertaining way give them fortune dice, and if in a "tagged aspect way" (e.g., they get into trouble because they play their character that way) that's work a fortune point or two on the Party sheet.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250631/#Comment_250631" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T09:42:35+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  9:42AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have not posted to FFG's forums, but that's a good idea.

Pretty much Beliefs from BW, switching out Fortune for Artha.

So howzabout this: generating the result your chosen action card gives you is always  in melee and ranged (unless otherwise specified, obviously -- we're talking the "vs. Defense" cards). But the player can add intents beyond the card, for + per intent. This is different than gaining + for circumstantial stuff like darkness, footing, positioning, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: player wants his character to hit via "strike" (or whatever the baseline card is) but also knock the guy to the ground. + Or...disarm the guy +. Actually, talking through it right now, I think you'd have to be careful not to replicate the effect of an existing card. Or if you do, make good and sure the + is a stiffer penalty than whatever the card asks for.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously the big hole in this scheme is that everyone needs to be on board with what an "intent" entails. EDIT for my own edification: Maybe limit the size of an extra intent to something that can be dealt with via a single Maneuver.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251456/#Comment_251456" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T15:30:54+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  3:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that would be a good rule for a fast and dirty version of the game where you don't use cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, as you began to suspect, that it would immediately break the card effects in not good ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for hacks where you want to port the dice to genres / settings where the cards wouldn't really be applicable...that would work fine.

I'm still mulling them over:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DarkDungeons</cite><br>...even so, in most cards, the benefits are often much more varied and comprehensive, outlining multiple successes and Boon effects as well. So the price will probably be lower and the benefits probably be higher, if it's an action card.<br><br>Plus most "effect" oriented attacks could easily be classified as part of the stunt action.<br/></br></br></br></blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Skywalker</cite><br/>That is one factor to take into account. However, I think the certainty of the Action Cards will ensure that they remain the primary mechanic for additional effects. However, the addition of a system for dealing with effects driven from the narrative is excellent.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251461/#Comment_251461" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T16:15:39+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  4:15PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So is this discussion basically suggesting a way to regulate doing what the rules already tell you to do anyway?

So I proposed that if the player wanted to do something a bit more than what the card said -- like, in addition to simply striking and doing damage, you also wanted to knock a guy down. That strikes me as +-worthy.<br>\n<br>\nSo this has more to do with die pool construction than interpretation.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251477/#Comment_251477" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T17:29:33+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  5:29PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh, so "get 1 success with the extra difficulty and you both hit AND knock the guy down?"  Wouldn't that make it impossible to hit and not knock the guy down?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first instinct would have been to tie wanting to do something orthagonal to the main task to Boons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you wanted to not just hit the guy but to hit him in the eyeslit of his helmet as a way to circumvent his ueber armor...that I'd add purple dice to...its more of the thing you're already doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you wanted to do something orthagonal (that could succeed or fail independently of the main roll) I'd be inclined to add a black die to represent the added challenge of doing two things at once and then have you buy the knockdown effect with Boons (in lieu of buying a critical or something).  If it was slippery terrain, or a particularly clever use of leverage or misdirection on your part I'd probably throw you a white die for the condition/effort.  In fact...I'd probably forgo the black die if it was an occassional request in a dramatically appropriate circumstance and only hit you with it if you got repetitious.  Since Black Dice are misfortune as opposed to difficulty that would be representative of the Karma of the universe becoming bored with the repetition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251565/#Comment_251565" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T08:05:24+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  8:05AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph: That's already modeled via my "cash in a boon for a future Fortune die".

So I wanted to model something more certain -- you have a compound intent (hey I came up with a term!), which is an all-or-nothing thing, so it ought to cost a lot but also give a lot. But that is softened in conjunction with my Boon/Bane rule, which allows for nudges in similar directions.<br>\n<br>\nSo...like you want to hit the guy for damage and knock him to the ground -- compound intent. +1P.
