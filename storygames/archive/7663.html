I'd never even heard of it before, but a game geared towards generational play had been on my mind recently. I'm not sure if it really counts as a 'story game,' but the crowd here tends to be some of the smarted gamers I know, so I'm hoping someone can tell me: what's Pendragon like in actual play? Looks like the only way to get it is print on demand, is it worth it?<br/><br/>Edit: Fixed the title.

It also happens to be one of my favorite (and most played) games, ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, while the CONCEPTS behind the mechanics are genius and powerful, the actual mechanics themselves are pretty creaky by modern standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe core dice system is Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying (Modified to use d20s instead of %ile) and as such is subject to all the whiff-tacular whiffage whiffiness that plagues BRP.  But it is quick to play and easy to house rule, so its still totally playable.  One of my all time dreams would be to buy the license and team up with Jake Norwood to redo the game in v. 2.0 Riddle of Steel.  That would be Hawt to the 10th power.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a wonderful timeline of Arthurian events and suitable adventures (hooks, mini adventures, full fledged module-esque scenarios) that take you from the death of Uther through the death of Arthur year by year (season by season in some cases).  So GM prep is relatively easy compared to most old school games.<br/>\n<br/>\nActual play looks likes this.  1) Spend some time at court interacting with famous NPCs and bragging about your achievements...witness or hear about and occassionally participate in key events of Arthurian canon.  2)  comport yourself with the dignity due your rank, including the bonuses that come from spending loads of money on clothes and food and expensive gifts.  3) Get hooked into an adventure (perhaps a tournament is declared, some maiden comes to court desperate for assistance, the king asks for knights to right a wrong...whatever).  4) Go on adventure, have your virtue tested, be driven by your passions, succomb to your vices.  5) Return to your lands for the winter where you will hope to achieve sufficient prosperity to pay for your opulent lifestyle or else next year you will poor.  Try to have babies, hope your horses survive the winter, go on mini adventures like hunting, or garrison duty.  6) Continue with step 1 earning honor and renown until you either die or retire old and famous.  7) return to play as the son of your previous character with all the benefits (and baggage) of beind a descendent of your first character brings.  8) repeat all this until your second character dies or retires...and hopefully (if you had children who survived) you can play the grandson (and maybe even great grandson) of your original character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the tone of the game, the events, and the adventures change.  Initially the game is very gritty and historic (or at least pseudo-historic) with the Britons on the verge of being extinguished by the Saxons, raiding each other for cattle.  Then in Arthur's early years its all about war.  You can fight battle after battle (with a pretty cool battle sytem) against your fellow Britons, against Saxons, against the "Romans".  Then after Arthur is triumphant the game gets more fantastical with merry feasts and adventures into faerie and romance and chivalry.  Then after the Dolorous Stroke, things turn grim and start to fall apart, good knights start dying in droves Briton goes to shit Lancelot is exiled, Arthur dies and the magic dies with him.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Not only does it have the generational aspect but it also has a slew of balanced Passions as traits that are used during play to compel the player to behave in certain way.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI will note that this is a common misconception in Pendragon.  Your Traits can only compel behavior if they are 16+ (on a 20 point scale) and that is pretty hard to do unless you really work at it, and its super easy to keep your Traits below 16 if you want (though there are rewards for going higher).   Mostly the Traits are indicative of past behavior and used to represent what others think of you (people you meet have heard you're dishonest and lazy for instance).  If you want them to think of you as honest and energetic, you simply act that way on a regular basis and over time the Traits will change to match your actual behavior.  Only if your scores are 16+ can the GM compel you to lie or laze-away (and then you can roll to avoid it and call in other traits like your Loyalty and such to help you pass).  Lots of players (including myself sometimes) like to go ahead and roll against their traits to let the dice decide how they react, that's totally not mandatory (although some of the published modules are unfortuneately written as if it was...the core rules are quite clear that its not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170203/#Comment_170203" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T15:46:47+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  3:46PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, <br><br>There are also times when you can use the traits to act as a resolution system.

Usually by this point, you shouldn't have a shortage of characters - you have a surplus! Many of which can be played in separate adventures, maybe even rotating the GM (Pendragon being one of those games that suggests this).<br><br>It can be very lethal, as Patty says, so a surplus of characters is not a bad thing. Having said that, it does get less lethal as the game goes on, and technology (well, mainly armour) improves dramatically.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170267/#Comment_170267" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T06:43:22+00:00" title="September 20, 2008  6:43AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2008 6:46AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: somelady</cite>If you're thinking about playing it, and not just designing based on it, the other thing to keep in mind is that it's really really deadly.</blockquote>\nOMG, that's hilarious.

Sir Gwydion (my knight) was constantly getting smacked around in combat until he got to 8 HPs (IIRC). Lose a single HP more, and he would be rendered unconscious.

I ran it for two of my friends and it was great fun.  The GPC is just a big toolbox that Greg has set up, and I found it really useful to take what I wanted and ignore the rest.  He's got great stuff in there.  The Uther period is the most structured section and the least open, but this was intentional on Greg's part as the following section the Anarchy Period essentially leaves Salisbury in the hands of the PCs.  The Anarchy Period provides for a much more open game where the PCs have much more autonomy and the training wheels come off. (THE KING IS DEAD!  YOUR LIEGE IS DEAD! THE SAXONS ARE AT THE DOOR! etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game also has a pretty low prep time as I was spending maybe an hour or so the night before working on the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg also often answers questions about the game over on the Arthaus/White Wolf Message boards for Pendragon in case anybody's interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nNick                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170899/#Comment_170899" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T09:03:32+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  9:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 9:22AM by Kropotkin.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *The healing rate for a character is their Str+Con/10 HP per week.

"Superhuman" characters could get up to a D4 I guess. . .<br/>\n<br/>\nIn play this ends up being less of problem than it might appear as several months will likely have passed between battles or adventures.  The timescale on which the game is played is one of the best things about it.  My group's PCs went from being young inexperienced knights to weary veterans in 10 years (game time) or so (there are LOTS of  large battles during the Uther period).  Nobody died, but they all were pretty grievously wounded at some point.  The unconsciousness rules are there for a reason.  Passing out can save your character from getting killed!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the reasons the combat system works is precisely because it is pretty deadly.  Combat is serious business here which breaks the game away from lots of other games where PCs can enter into cambat without batting an eye--which is fine if that's what you're looking for but this is a grittier approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170960/#Comment_170960" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:35:38+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. <br/><br/>Next time I play I'm going to have to pay very careful attention to how carefully I follow the rules.

Same Pendragon 2nd to 3rd.  Pendragon 4th is really nothing more than a reprint of a couple of Pendragon 3rd books into one cover (with like 1 chapter of actually new...but totally unnecessary (yet cool) material) thrown in.  Pendragon 5th is really just a reprint of Pendragon 4th...possibly even removing a few things (though now I can't really remember).  About the biggest difference between 3, 4 and 5 is who published it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint being, if you're having trouble finding it, you can pretty much pick up any edition you want off of ebay (though you'd pay a pretty penny for 1st or 2nd).  The main difference is in how the core supplements are packaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nPendragon was one of the first RPGs to throw out the "your character can be anything" paradigm.  You were a knight...period.  Not a wizard, not a commoner mercenary, not a street rat...a knight...don't like it play something else.  The core rules went even a step further, not only were you a knight but you were a newly made knight of Salisbury...not London, not Orkney, not Ireland...Salisbury...don't like it play something else.  3rd edition let you play ladies and made handwavy motions at allowing female knights (in that "if you really must violate the canon I guess you can" kind of tone)...I cant remember if that was presented in earlier editions.  It also introduced Knights Adventurous, the supplement that did allow you to be knights from different parts of of the Arthurian world.  4th edition packaged Knights Adventurous right into the core book as I recall and introduced rules to let you be a Merlin-esque druid character (with rules that made for really cool NPCs but pretty not-fun PCs).  If you're buying 3rd edition, The Boy King supplement gives you the campaign timeline.  A beefed up version of this is what was rereleased as the The Great Pendragon Campaign for 5th (I think 4th just reprinted The Boy King, but I can't recall entirely).  Everything else...Perilous Forest, Land of Giants, Savage something or other, are basically mini campaigns / adventure books for a specific geographical area and are pretty compatable accross any edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171004/#Comment_171004" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T13:17:56+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  1:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and if anyone across the pond can get your hands on any of the old Beaumain fanzine issues from back in the day...I will pay a bounty for the ones I don't have...they are almost impossible to find over here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171047/#Comment_171047" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T15:14:14+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  3:14PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            God damnit... <br><br>Every single weekend is booked until the end of the year, as well as about 65% of all my weekend nights.

Basically, he does what all traditional GM's do (and it feels strange calling Greg a traditional GM, of course, since he is simultaneously an innovative games designer): in the moment-to-moment of play, he decides which rules to use and which rules to ignore. Over time, he might selectively drop certain rules often enough that he forgets about them and treats his current approach as the standard rule. When I've pointed out an official rule, he has occasionally asked for the page reference, which was the source of my "benign rules lawyer" comment <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Basically, he treats the printed rules as a toolbox, and decides whether or not to use them in the moment. An age-old practice.<br/><br/>Also, as you suspect, he is an inveterate tinkerer: so he is always has a few house rules for different systems that he is trying out at any given time. Many of these are not replacements for existing systems, but additions to them. (For example, one house rule he has used: when PCs get married, another PC plays their wife, and is responsible for her training and actions when in a scene.) Some of these find their way into sourcebooks. <br/><br/>It is clear as someone commented, that there are some things he does with the system that aren't in the rules. For instance, with the battle system, he treats the rules as a framework, and adds in lots of events geared to the players rather than simply relying on the tables. He's talked about expanding the battle system, and has playtested a new approach recently at a UK convention which gives players a lot more freedom of action, and ability to influence the course of the battle. It's likely this will be the core of a new supplement. It's an impressive overhaul (and I say that as a big fan for the current official battle rules).<br/><br/>I'm hesitatnt to put words in Greg's mouth, but it may be that he believes there are certain aspects to GMing, some of which may be personal to each GM, that are more of an art than a science (deciding when to use or ignore a rule, for instance), and resist this kind of systemisation and therefore they can't easily be put into a rulebook. I don't think this is a controversial view, really, outside of the highly focussed games produced by some people hereabouts <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There are a couple of outstanding supplements Greg has recently published independently of White Wolf, which pendragon fans really should look at:<br/><a href="http://www.weareallus.com/pendragon/pendragonpublications.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.weareallus.com/pendragon/pendragonpublications.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171138/#Comment_171138" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T02:10:06+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  2:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2008 12:32PM by Kropotkin.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of our problems with the game was the fact that the Players had very little way of influencing the outcome of a battle--even when they were in positions of authority.  I often let my players make Uther's commander rolls, and I made the rolls for the Saxons.  The system as written is a framework which allows you to improvise things, but it often left us feeling a little at sea.  Seems like Greg is fully aware of those issues.  I hope he makes the alternate battle rules available.  I was looking at using "The Berkeley Battle Rules" which was another alternate battle system which I think is still available on the Pendragon Yahoo Group.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the flaws, battles were still lots of fun as you usually gained lots of Glory and/or some nasty wounds.  I was looking ahead at Greg's write-up for Badon (Arthur's final defeat of the Saxons) in the GPC, and I noticed it goes on for several DAYS of game time.  That is going to be nasty enough that if a PC survives they'll be justifiable proud.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171211/#Comment_171211" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T09:25:17+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:25AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph (and all),<br/><br/>I'd say that the part where "the players don't influence the battle" is part of the problem I had with the system -- in the past.<br/><br/>I see the game differently now, and believe that the idea of the Players, via the PCs, are part of something larger than themselves where they "ride" the situation (or the situation "rides" them!) is part of the charm, fun and <i>purpose</i> of the game.  <br/><br/>In other words, I think the Battle System makes more sense to -- even as it stands now -- than it did years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171368/#Comment_171368" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T19:47:21+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  7:47PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's one thing I always liked about the battle system - the battle went on around you, and would be won or lost.

Which is quite different from the way mass battle is handled by any other game I'm familiar with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171371/#Comment_171371" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T20:00:15+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  8:00PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171377/#Comment_171377" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T21:14:49+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:14PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to have big fights with two of my players about the battle system. Half the group loved it because it made the battle something that happened, a big thing that you couldn't control, and you had to deal with what it brought to you in the moment. You could only control your little world, not the whole world. The other half of the group wanted to control the battle, to have their actions determine if the whole battle was won or lost. <br/><br/>We had big discussions about heroes and what makes a hero -- the person who does what they can where they are or the person who changes the whole world. In the end we stuck with the battle system, more or less as written, because as one of the players that disliked it finally said "well I guess I can play superheroes in other games." <br/><br/>It really was a thing though, the idea that your knight, your protagonist, your hero is really just a guy on a horse and can't change the whole world every time, no matter how successful he might be in his little sphere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171379/#Comment_171379" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T21:39:41+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:39PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 12:56PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Brand,<br/><br/>And, thematically, I think that's something that's running through the whole game, of course.  Everyone entering the game knows there will be a rise (of Arthur's realm, of splendor, of manners and customs) and a fall.  And there's not a darned thing they can do about it.<br/><br/>This is something I'm going to break out in a future thread, but I think there's something vitally different about this meta-plot and almost any other meta-plot I've ever seen published:<br/><br/>Unlike <i>Earthdawn, Tribe 8, Shadowrun</i>, the World of Darkness metaplots and all the other games that had long-running metaplots pushed through months and or years of publishing, everyone <i>knows</i> the metaplot of <i>Pendragon</i> beforehand.  In all the other games there's this tension (if not anxiety) for everyone playing the game (GM and Players): "We can go down this road, but in a few months game company X will be publishing a book and we might be crashing against what they're publishing."<br/><br/>In Pendragon that's not the case <i>at all</i>.  And I believe that the difference in application is <i>huge</i>.  <br/><br/>We all know the story of King Arthur and his knights to a varying degree.  So, anyone who decides to invest in the game already knows the ground rules and says, "Yes.  I want <i>that</i>."<br/><br/>This is a completely different situation than not knowing.  This is knowing in full.  You know you're plugging yourself into the context of a pre-established background.<br/><br/>Instead of questions like, "What will the metaplot bring, and how will it fit with what we're doing?" the questions become:<br/><br/>"How do I stand in relation to Arthur. To his rise and fall."<br/>"How do I stand in relation to Lancelot?  To romance and to adultery and duty vs. love?"<br/>"Where do I stand in the blood feuds that take place between the Orkney clan and -- well, everyone?  Do I put family before the King's Law...?  Or not?"<br/><br/>Because the background is known, defined and fixed, the Players get to create characters and take actions that make a point in the context of the tale, using their knowledge of the ongoing tale to dramatic and/or ironic effect.<br/><br/>This, of course, is what Mallory does as well... he gives us knights that put family above the law, or the law above love, and so on.  And since he spins out yarns of many knights, all of which show different kinds of knights making different kinds of choices, the Players (with their knights) are simply folding more knights into the tales and becoming part of that tradition, creating the tales Mallory didn't hear about or didn't write down.<br/><br/>The Battle System, in my view, reflects this tension in the game -- a tension that is echoed in all aspects of the game: your knight can fight like hell for Camelot, but Camelot is going to fall; you can fight like hell to keep your knight alive, but one way or another your knight is going to die; you can go into battle amid an army and slaughter till your skin is flayed, you won't be turning the tide.<br/><br/>Just like the tension between the mundane and the fantastic, the bloody and the ideal -- which Greg lays out so clearly in his notes to the third and fifth editions -- the knights are part of something larger than themselves that they never will master and never determine.  Inside that tension of the finite wrapped inside the infinite is some of the magic that I think makes the game spark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171452/#Comment_171452" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T08:33:00+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  8:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 8:37AM by Kropotkin.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of our best sessions actually was actually result of pre-scripted battle/story.  Uther half heartedly agrees to help the ailing Roman Empire against the Franks in Northern France, and he places his impetuous bastard son, Madoc, in charge of this operation.  One of my players was playing Agorix: a Romano Britain who desperately wanted to help the Gauls.  Greg lays out exactly what happens during the adventure in Northern France.  After "liberating" a single city (i.e. they practically burned it to the ground) Madoc decides to leave Praetor Syagrius and the Romans to their fate and return to Britain.  My players, who previously had enjoyed Madoc's impetuous nature, were now on the receiving end of a bad decision (or least one they didn't like).  They angrily tried to confront the Prince who rebuffed them, and they received a stern warning from their liege Earl Roderick--who also obviously agreed with the PCs but was first and foremost about duty to the Prince.  The PCs had done very well in fighting the Franks, but the whole operation was perceived by them as a failure.  Agorix felt personally guilty about leaving the Praetor and his men behind--knowing full well they are going to lose.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis session set up my players to feel very dubious about Uther himself when he takes his army to Wales to go to war over Igraine.  So how do you deal with it when you know your leaders are making bad decisions and you're a loyal knight?  It tainted all the later battles for the character and made Uther seem less worthy in their eyes.  Great drama there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171460/#Comment_171460" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T09:11:20+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  9:11AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, <br/><br/>Yes, absolutely. <br/><br/>Also, there is another thing that goes on with other metaplots vs Pendragon, that's around the same tension as the knowing/not-knowing one you describe so well. That's that the PCs in Pendragon aren't expected to fix it/ save it/ be it end all and be all. <br/><br/>Like, in Tribe 8 the PCs (or two or three generations of PCs) are supposed to be the ones that save the world. They're supposed to start in one place, go to another, do all this stuff, and be the central pivot of a lot of the most important fights (if not the most important decisions) that will save the whole world. Its very heroic paradigm based, in which the PCs are the center of the whole world, not just the whole story of the game. (Two very different things that are often mistaken for each other in large-scope games.) And, as you say, you're supposed to do all this without knowing what is going to happen. <br/><br/>In Pendragon, however, the PCs aren't expected to either save or kill Camelot. The rise and fall of civilization in the game is known and external to the PCs. Thus the PCs focus is cleared to be on themselves, their own story, their own choices. <br/><br/>In the last full campaign of Pendragon I played there was a moment toward the end of the game that I'll never forget. The final battles are coming down, and the PCs are with Gawain when he comes back from France wounded after his battle with Lancelot. When the boats get attacked on the shore and Gawain rises from his bed to go and fight, everyone at the table knew he was going to die. There wasn't a moment of "oh shits, we need to save dude" as we all knew this was where he was going to bite it, and that there was no saving him. So one PC says "I'm going to go with him, the rest of you go to Arthur." And the other players say, OOCly, "But you'll die!" and he responds "So? We're at the end anyway. I'd rather die with Gawain and drown in my own blood in the surf than live in a fallen world fighting with lesser men." <br/><br/>He knew what was going to happen, and knew that the expectation on him wasn't to fix it or change it, but to make a decision about how he felt about it. And he did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171500/#Comment_171500" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T11:45:03+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 11:45AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow...the entire conversation about what I was going to say...has already happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrand and Revised Christopher ;-) have channeled what I like from the Battle System precisely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171501/#Comment_171501" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T11:47:19+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 11:47AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My formative experiences with Pendragon were really terrible, and have given me much of my behind-the-hand sniggering at BRP ever since.
