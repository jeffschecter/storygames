What does the prep (in the OSR sense of "prep") require?<br/>\u2022 Fortune: determine randomly<br/>\u2022 Drama: what would make sense given the needs of the story? What would look cool? What does the prep (in the plot-writing GM sense of "prep") require?<br/><br/>It says to try to figure out an outcome for each method, and then choose the outcome you like the best out of the three. Well...<br/><br/>Honestly I love Everway very very much but I've never had a good session of it, only a couple of bad ones. It's a very beginner friendly system in that it is one of the only games from its era that explains how it's to be run. But it's very very much based on GM whim, and it teaches some bad habits. The GM can override the diegetic cirumstances in order to further some story or plot along. And, the introductory adventure is pretty bad, too. <small>Then again, unlike the linear DSA-modules of yore there's no mismatch here. The rules <em>support</em> the typical 90:s linear play instead of being incomprehensible or illusionistic or contradictory.</small><br/><br/>But I would want to use it for sandbox play.<br/><br/>I'm curious if I could salvage it by prepping locations OSR-style with stats, using the card decks in combination with prep instead of roll tables etc. I really want to try it again now that I have a couple of years of experience with D&amp;D. And I would be very careful with using "Drama",<br/><br/>In my experience I've come to realize that drama is pretty much poison that kills a good game session. Your mileage may definitively vary, but that's my experience as gamemaster and as player. Fortune otoh has been gold.<br/><br/>The idea would be to write up a location-based adventure with NPCs including "tables" -- referring to cards (both fortune and vision cards) for this stuff rather than numbered lines in a table, but that's the gist. I could use the cards to reincorporate a lot, too.<br/><br/>With most monsters statted, I could try resolving most fights with Karma without drawing a fortune card (the fortune deck at my side if I really do need it). Just like Cthulhu Dark says "if you fight any creature you meet, you will die"; I could make up some similar rules based on the elemental and magical numbers the heroes have. We could do the fights with various degrees of granularity.<br/><br/>When there are gaps in that prep, Fortune to the rescue. Drawing a random vision card or fortune card even when there aren't previously established elements on them would still OK but I'd do it less often than I did BitD.<br/><br/>Then when there are gaps in the fortune, again I'd resort to karma to resolve those gaps.<br/><br/>"Drama" in the sense of improvising some cool flavor would be the final fallback.<br/><br/>That's pretty much how I run D&amp;D today. Let's say they're opening a desk drawer:<br/><br/>1. Does the prep say what's in the drawer? [Karma] That's what's in the drawer.<br/>2. If no, can I determine randomly what's in the drawer? [Fortune] Then that's what's in the drawer.<br/>3. If no, is there something that would make sense to be in the drawer? [Karma again] Then that's what's in the drawer. Emptiness is OK here.<br/>4. Last resort if I can't determine what would make sense -- what would be cool? What would give an appropriate sense of place? What would provide tension, choices, future adventure? [Drama]. Even though this is the last resort, my D&amp;D prep is hole-filled enough that I often enough fall here. (And I make a mental note for future sessions.)<br/><br/>Karma &gt; Fortune &gt; Karma again &gt; Drama.<br/><br/>When I ran Everway both BitD, and when I gave it another shot around 2009, I sort of had some locations in mind (but there was nothing really for the PC:s to <em>do</em> there, I just wanted them to see my cool vision cards) and then I improvised the journey there by drawing cards but it ended up being just pretty linear journey because I wanted them to see the dog-ape cards that I had painted up and cut to the same size as Everway's own cards. Why I put them at the end of the journey instead of earlier I blame my own bad-GM:ing. I can't believe that as late as 2009 I was still such a horrible GM and didn't know it.<br/><br/>I was doing Drama &gt; Fortune &gt; Karma. The fortune elements were more for flavor than for anything else. I thought I was being careful with drama but it was still first and foremost and in a bad way, too. I wasn't really doing what was good for the story in the sense of what would be good for the proceedings in fiction. I was doing "what would <em>I</em> like to see happen?".<br/><br/>I'm prepping a couple of other campaigns already but I would be curious to see if I could once in my life have a session that wasn't completely disastrous (every time I've ran Everway, it has cost me every player in that group) of a game I still really love dearly for its flavor, for its art, for its world, for its look, for its writing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461937/#Comment_461937" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T20:50:07+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  8:50PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's always nice to see someone so thoughtfully dissecting their own play.<br/><br/>I don't have anything to say about Everway, as I haven't read or played it, but this comment/musing did spring to mind:<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything inherently bad about Drama resolution. When it sucks is when it has either a) not been properly communicated to the people playing (e.g. they think the game is one thing, but you're actually doing another), or b) it's purely in the hands of one player. Your game sounds like it may have been doing both!<br/><br/>In addition, it needs some kind of creative focus - a sense of why we're playing this particular game and what we're trying to get out of it. What purpose does Drama resolution serve here, and how do I, as a player, use that to my advantage?<br/><br/>More related to your actual topic:<br/><br/>I understand starting with Karma and ending with Drama (there is a logic here, as an improvisational tool), but what is the significance of the Fortune and second Karma? They seem rather arbitrary, in comparison. <br/><br/>In particular, the third and fourth steps in your breakdown clash with each other in many game styles. (This is one of the places where being aware of Creative Agenda can really help, whether you subscribe to theory or not. What is your goal in describing the contents of the drawer? What does the game need you to do? It seems to me that in most cases if <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is applicable, then <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> might be a terrible idea, and vice-versa.)<br/><br/>In any case, food for thought! Interesting thought process you've got going on here; it's nice to see it being examined like this, in the open. (I'm always in favour or critical thinking and the examination of play practices. However, in particular, this works against what I call the Mystery GM Cult, which is something I always support.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461939/#Comment_461939" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T21:14:34+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  9:14PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good points and kind words.

Roll on a random table</blockquote>\nIf there <i>is</i> a random table, I should just go directly to it. The idea here (though admittedly this thread was unusually half-baked for me) is that there is a list of priorities with fallbacks.<br/><br/>Is there prep? Then yes, prep overrides tables. Is there tables? Then yes, tables override own ideas. Does the own ideas make sense? Then yes, karma overrides drama. If nothing makes sense, then drama. Lumpley's "Coherence and Contradictions" is a good source for that.\n<blockquote>Come up with something interesting related to current, past, or future events in your game, and how it is coincidentally of terrible relevance to the characters.</blockquote>\nYes, this, or, again, Coherence and Contradictions is another good source here. Not only was I using drama more than I could handle, I wasn't even doing any good or interesting drama. I was doing it in a very directed way. Subconsciously railroading ("but I'm improvising so I can't be railroading" but yeah I was).<br/><br/><br/>Hmm to clarify a bit about the "makes sense" part because the desk drawer wasn't a great example.<br/>In my glitchworld campaign I had prepped every NPC:s and monsters stats and some info about them. I had locations rooftops maps etc. Karma.<br/><br/>I also had plenty of tables and other own mechanics. Fortune.<br/><br/>Now, the fallback in the city or jungle I could use "karma again". What would make sense to be here? What would the wallpaper look like in this noble's house? She's so brazen yet unsure, she'd probably use one of the noble colors, so very lightly purply tinged deep dark crimson color.<br/><br/>But when we were deep in the glitch, nothing made sense. I would have to use drama.
