The power of the gods was shattered in the apocalypse and the players are new Valkyries, daughters of that philanderer Wotan (Odin), who ride sky cycles and fight giant wolves and the fighter jets of various competing warlords. Valhalla crashed to earth during Ragnar\xf6k, but Wotan has adopted Kirbytech to make it fly again, a bunch of shattered fragments of the old palace linked together by bridges, Final Fantasy style.  The characters are sweet.  Alexis' Valkyrie was trained by a ex-Valkyrie in the city that grew up among the shattered pieces of Valhalla that remain on the ground and became a target of Das Schwarze Auge (The Dark Eye), a criminal brotherhood named after the venerable German RPG. David's Valkyrie runs a pirate radio station. They have each been given a shard of the broken Bifrost Bridge by Wotan, but it's not clear exactly what they're supposed to do with them yet.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and a Valkyrie's Nature is: <i>flying</i> (sky cycles, planes, etc.), <i>dealing with the dead</i> (talking to ghosts, stealing people's souls for Valhalla), and <i>killing</i> (they are supposed to be bloodthirsty battle maidens).  Can't wait.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229585/#Comment_229585" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T08:37:21+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  8:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?p=80948#post80948" rel="nofollow">After a month off, Storn and I met up for some Burning Wheel action in the 13 Cities</a>.<br/><br/>My favorite interaction of the night:<br/><br/>Me: As you get closer to Baal, the scale of the Elder Ring above the city becomes clear and the steppe nomad you are traveling with begins to realize just how cyclopean your city's tree-god really is.<br/><br/>Nomad: I never seen anything like it.<br/><br/>Storn's PC:  It is beautiful, isn't it?

Robin supplied<br/>that, since the animals of the forest weren't killed, only paralyzed, that they all sang out, screaming in <br/>harmony with Blod. That was a great moment.<br/><br/>And earlier, Blod and my character (Arin Blade Eater) were Ensorcelling while Crystaline Frost Moth Master <br/>was Being Ensorcelled. So, Arin was snapping twigs which simultaniously broke the backs of all these townsfolk<br/>who were fleeing down the snowy mountainside, and then Blod opened this wound in the sky which a column of<br/>night-black crows poured out of, blotting out the sky almost completely. The crows then swooped down on us<br/>and devoured everyone's flesh, including Blod's, as he laughed menacingly. Crystaine Frost Moth Master fled as<br/>he was being fleshed, and cut open this giant ice beast (which Blod had been riding in the first scene) and sewed<br/>himself inside of it, for protection. <br/><br/>The game ended with Blod accruing enough Lashes and Dark Sigils for Satan to welcome him to Hell.<br/><br/>The game, which i'll perhaps write more about when i have the complete use of both hands again, is called Unending Grimness.<br/>i whipped it up for those whom i played it with, some vegan black metal fans.

My friend Chuck, who had never played a story game, was my opponent. We were Viking warriors who attacked each others' masculinity between raids on the Irish coast, until finally his guy had had enough of mine, and we had it out on an Irish beach while our crewmates watched. The usual over-the-top theatrics of Showdown duels ensued, with slashed femoral arteries and open-fractured jaws and a bit-off nose and dying in a pool of vomit, mucus, and mingled blood.<br/><br/>An interesting thing came up in our game: Chuck never won the Flash of Insight during play, although he started with it, and thus never Revealed one of my Qualities to be an embarrassing lie. Instead, I won the Flash five times in a row, the last time allowing me to Injure his last remaining pair of dice and bring the game to its conclusion. For those unfamiliar with Showdown, this means that I was able to take every element of his character's self-image and reveal the gap between it and the sad reality, while carefully preserving my character's own ego (although he was revealed within the fiction as a slaver and a sociopath, violent, abusive and utterly lacking in empathy, but all in a way consonant with his picture of himself as a Viking warrior).  The descent of Chuck's character into pathos was perfect, and it made for a very memorable arc as he became a loser in the eyes of our crew and our village, with no way to confront my character other than sudden violence.<br/><br/>It was a really good time, a game that both Chuck and I will play again. Highly recommended. And for players in a hurry, note that we played out the whole game in a Puppetlandesque 55 minutes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230230/#Comment_230230" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T17:00:52+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  5:00PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Curse of the Yellow Sign:<br/>1 PC insane. 5 PCs dead: 1 blown up, 1 knifed, 1 suicide, 2 shot. +4 NPCs dead.<br/><br/>Blackout:<br/>Everyday NYC commuter struggling to survive an alien invasion set in the 2003 NYC blackout.

They could relay the information to the other players but had to do so through roleplay (vs. just handing the sheet to everyone).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231550/#Comment_231550" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T05:52:09+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  5:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had a character creation session for Empire of Dust last night.  3 Alliance PC's ended up consisting of:<br><br>-An Engineer who trained under Dr. William Kimo himself, has black level R&amp;D clearance and is serving as the intelligence element of this particular group<br>-The Autumnstar, a Mage from Exodus Tower who is leading this rag-tag band and doesn't even realize his looming destiny<br>-A Bruta Gunknight who rides into battle atop his mighty Duar mount leveling buildings with his devastating rail-gun<br><br/>I don't even know if a Bruta Gunknight riding a Duar is a legal build but it seemed viable so I let it go.

And I spent much of the time playing Classic Traveller <a href="http://www.freelancetraveller.com/features/rules/alone.html" rel="nofollow">solo</a> on the plane.<br/><br/>It actually worked out really well, and the crew of the Free Trader Rocinante was a Merchant Captain who was barely making ends meet, a Navy Lt. engineer who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty, a Scout pilot who BS'd his way into the job, and Marine Colonel who also happened to be a Baron and the black ship of his influential family. The Baron quickly ended up being a very interesting character who started off as a high passenger and ended up as the "Security/Liaison/Cargo Officer" due to his unique skills.<br/><br/>In a short time, the crew talked their way around some "discrepancies" in their cargo manifest, found themselves embroiled in a secret war between a group of suicidal cultists and the secret police who were after them, and escaping from a laser-blasting patrol cutter and into jump space.<br/><br/>One technique of making the story happen in solo play with multiple characters was to write a "crewman's log" for every character between systems. This gave me a real chance to explore the story in their own words, and the personalities of the crew as well as their differing relationships really started to come out. And when I was on vacation, taking days in-between gaming sessions helped provide a fresh perspective when I sat down to play again without having to make split decisions all the time.<br/><br/>In solo play you really need to look at every piece of content giving to you and find a way to run with it. I'm looking forward to doing more of it, actually!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231754/#Comment_231754" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:15:04+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Ravenloft (via Warhammer 2nd.

My character had been<br/>studying the whalesong for quite some time, and while finding many interesting things about them, had not yet come to the conclusion<br/>that they are sentient. Was this just mythology, then, on the Skraeling's part? Their "peace treaty" with the whales just a form of<br/>spirituality, a "connection to the land?" Very fascinating.<br/>A second issue was that of a stow-away Skraeling who made, for all that we could understand, an attempt on our comerade Skraeling's<br/>life. Inadvertantly, we cut off his little arm (kinda scrawny things, Skraelings). Our comerade tells us that the limb will regrow, but until it<br/>does, the Skraeling will not be accepted back into its colony on the back of the whale. (Our comerade had no mind for revenge, and we<br/>didn't bring it up.)The colony would just leave it to die. But we couldn't keep it captive- the poor thing was going insane from containment,<br/>and we polar bears clearly couldn't imprison it for any length of time and consider ourselves civilized.<br/><br/>How shall we re-habilitate a dangerous being? Should we interceed on behalf of those people, even if it spells doom for these people?<br/>At what stage of intellegence do animals deserve our respect?

They're hunting the lieutenant of a necromancer. The party is hoping to break up some of the zombie hordes that infest the keep, grab the lieutenant's magic hat, and escape, all in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>They find a secret door from the roof to the top level of the storehouse and pile in. There's tripwires at the bottom of the stairwell attached to little devices across the room. There's zombies shambling towards them. The Cleric has closed the trapdoor (which doesn't open from the inside).<br/><br/>"Let's set off the trap when the zombies get in front of the devices! They'll block whatever the trap is."<br/><br/>One of the zombies makes its save and dodges the clay pot. The pot bursts on the stairs. Whatever's inside the pot bursts into flames, setting the stairs and 3/4 of the party on fire. Three hirelings die instantly, everyone else runs around on fire. The party manages to kill the zombies, but not without getting even more beaten up.<br/><br/>Now they're trapped way, way behind enemy lines. They're beat to hell. They've got few resources.  They're boxed-in, and the lieutenant is going to return to his hideout with his zombie hordes any moment now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232075/#Comment_232075" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T00:12:30+00:00" title="September 13, 2009 12:12AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A snippet from a recent session of Lady Blackbird I ran over Skype:<br/>We cut to a scene with Mother Six, attended by two of her ratling minions as she sat in a dingy, smoky dive bar with Snargle (played by Arnold) and Naomi (played by Mick) walking up to her.  Mother Six was a corpulent woman with beady eyes who was settled into her rounded booth smoking from a hooka.  Naomi and Mother Six exchanged brief pleasantries; then Naomi began to request information on Uriah\u2019s wherabouts.  Mother Six cut her off and addressed Snargle, asking him if he was the pilot of The Owl, which surprised them both.  Mother Six told them both she knew The Owl had escaped from the Imperial ship The Hand of Sorrow and there was a bounty out for them.  She told Naomi that she was tempted to turn them in for the reward.  Naomi quickly reminded Mother Six that dealing with the Empire isn\u2019t always as easy as it sounds, to which Mother Six nodded.  Mother Six told the pair that she knows the secret path that smugglers use to reach Uriah and she would be willing to share it if Naomi helped her out.  \u201cYou see,\u201d Mother Six explained, \u201cI have this girl who has beaten everyone here in the pits and I could really use some competition..\u201d Naomi interrupted her to ask simply, \u201cWhere is she?

In addition to the Danger of being incapacitated (he'd already been raked by the Bonesmen), he risks her eternal scorn for fool heartedly risking the Resistance cell to retrieve her.<br/><br/>Colin and I had been rolling horribly all night, fleeing from one Danger to another.

It was also perfectly evocative of the Midnight-like feel we were going for. Good stuff.<br/><br/>One thing that really rocked that game for me were all the little touches of setting color that people introduced, especially those that revolved around magic. Our three "Gothic/Echo" resources were Wax, Water, and Chains. Finch had a rune-covered candle that would render us invisible to the badguys, but only if he kept up a certain chant. There was a lot of use of wax seals, maps (copied, annotated, and recopied as the city we live in sank slowly into the water), books, relics, glamours, and blessings (from the Raven Goddess!).<br/><br/>As someone who has been wanting to play something with arcane and atmospheric magic in it, and who really loves fiction involving old books and maps, *and* is getting into bookbinding and mixed media as a hobby, this was pure gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232298/#Comment_232298" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T14:25:45+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  2:25PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gothic/Echo!!<br/><br/>Wow.

Like I told Colin and Matt, I'm a seat-of-my-pants GM, so Gothic/Echo really worked well for my style.<br/><br/>There were several other great moments that just came out of the names of people and places we made up at first.  For example, they sought out the Cardinal, who had betrayed the side of Good and was holding audience at the Scarlet Masquerade, and while Finch distracted him in a very neat dialogue of mutual disgust, Rook had to fight off her old acolyte buddy Albert and his repeating crossbow.  Just the names tell you a lot of what was going on there.<br/><br/>One thing I really enjoyed about the system was that dangers linger around when they're not resolved.  Early on, after the bonesmen had taken Knock, the PCs listened to the shadow whispers to find her.  Their danger: they would attract the Scourge.  So for seven or so conflicts after that, they always kept the Scourge on their tail, never really shaking it but not getting caught either--and we had no idea what it was!  That made it all the more spooky.  (It turned out to be a black fog of banshees that infested Rook when she defeated Albert with her mystical power, as a result of paranormal backlash.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232337/#Comment_232337" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T17:42:48+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  5:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><b>BROKEN RAINBOW OMG</b><br/><br/>It was all pre-game setup and it was still metal.

John's junior valkyrie got captured, taken back to their hideout, and thrown in a meat locker with a couple dead gangster corpses which she subsequently reanimated as zombies with a tiny slice of a sacred apple of immortality that she stuffed in her pocket back in Valhalla. Lesley's valkyrie has the gangster's hideout completely staked out, though, and next session Lukas' character is prepared to go apeshit on the fools who dared "lay hands on a valkyrie." Oh yeah. This one is gonna be good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232756/#Comment_232756" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T01:15:20+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  1:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IAWA with my brand new group - all of the others new to story games, indie games and what not.<br/><br/>There's this malignant spirit trapped in a well underneath a new village built upon the remains of an old, lost civilisation. The spirit wants to chase the villagers away.<br/><br/>There's a girl with a leopard's soul. She wants to seduce the wolf hunter and to banish the spirit.<br/><br/>There's a seer, who wants to utterly destroy the leopard girl.<br/><br/>And there's a wolf hunter, capable of speaking with wolves, who was banned from the village 12 years past (when the leopard girl probably was born and possessed by a leopard spirit) and now wants to excorcise the leopard from the girl and become village chief.<br/><br/>We begin as the wolf hunter is trapped by the current chief and his men - and then thrown into the well. Much chaos ensues. The leopard girl seduces the wolf hunter. He in turn kills the current chief in a duel. The seer is possessed by the spirit - and the spirit tries to kill the leopard girl during the wedding/inauguration ceremony. But the girl lives, expels the spirit and marries the wold hunter, who then acchieves his goal. And everyone just saw the old seer stabbing the leopard girl - their new princess. So the seer is thrown into the well. Her last words to the princes, as the heavy lid is closed over her: "I curse the day I had you!"<br/><br/>Brilliant!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232801/#Comment_232801" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T08:52:33+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  8:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>Had a character creation session for Empire of Dust last night.  3 Alliance PC's ended up consisting of:<br/><br/>-An Engineer who trained under Dr. William Kimo himself, has black level R&amp;D clearance and is serving as the intelligence element of this particular group<br/>-The Autumnstar, a Mage from Exodus Tower who is leading this rag-tag band and doesn't even realize his looming destiny<br/>-A Bruta Gunknight who rides into battle atop his mighty Duar mount leveling buildings with his devastating rail-gun<br/><br/>I don't even know if a Bruta Gunknight riding a Duar is a legal build but it seemed viable so I let it go.

My weapon of choice was the growling chainsword that is 3:16.<br/><br/>I'll say this right off the bat, I love this game. It filled the Space-Marines-Exploding-Things-But-Also-Band-of-Brothers niche that I have always been seeking to fill. So, I rolled up a planet of terrible cultists under thrall of a space-egg full of evil monsters and set my Troopers against it.<br/><br/>Our party included Trooper Jordyn "Blenz" Chase (hot-headed maybe-lesbian), Trooper Jack "Blazer" Mahoney (showstopper patriotism poster-boy), Trooper ... umm, actually I can't remember his name because everyone kept calling him different things. Martinez, Santiago, Poncho, Valdez but mostly just Sanchez. He was a chain-smoking badass from Peru. So, peruvian. Not mexican. Apparently we're easily confused.<br/><br/>The group was led by the dumb-as-bricks Corporal Frank (who referred to himself as "Frank the Freedom Fighter") and their scheming Sergeant, Machus.<br/><br/>Quick story overview - they crash-landed on the planet and were swarmed, fought off some cultists and managed to survive without being too badly beaten. Following encounters were a solo between a sniper nest and Trooper Ramirez, a mortar attack on the Troopers' overnight hideout, a very short battle with the "blasphemy wagon" and a last-ditch battle with the hatched meteor-egg. It was chaos and bloodshed and awesome.<br/><br/>Outside the game, I think that it took a few mechanics attempts to get everything sorted out but there weren't any of those awkward stalls where people flip through the book. Everyone took to the Troopers-vs-but-on-a-team-with-Officers. A lot of this came from Machus' player being a sneaky fucker. Once people got the range concept in their head, we had a lot of fun with all the players trying to optimize their own kill and steal kills from each other.<br/><br/>Strengths and Weaknesses came into play pretty marvellously, too. Blazer single-handedly wiped out the only vehicle encounter with his "Perfect Spiral" Strength, hurling a grenade through the windshield. BAM. Their Sergeant bitched out at the start of a big scary encounter just because he "really just isn't here to die".<br/><br/>The players were all really happy and I got a ton of "let's play again!" before we moved on to other games. All in all, super fun. I felt a little odd about framing everything with these obvious "WE ARE PLAYING" board encounters vs. "WE ARE NOT REALLY PLAYING" sort of feeling in-between stuff, but I think that with a longer game, the players would get comfortable with their Troopers and their relationships."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233553/#Comment_233553" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T19:17:00+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  7:17PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/113/thats-duchess-to-you/" rel="nofollow">Ping rolls 20s.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233588/#Comment_233588" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T04:23:26+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  4:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played A Penny For My Thoughts last night, using the "we're just regular people" option.  <br/><br/>My guy gave up his life to help his sister, who was horribly mauled by his pet dog.

Instead we doomed the new dream to endless toil in the dark and the Dragon's Egg, though ours, has its own agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234010/#Comment_234010" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T01:54:21+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  1:54AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back from Gencon Oz...two of the better sessions run for my games, "The Eighth Sea" and "Quincunx".<br/><br/><b>The Eighth Sea (A game about time travelling pirates)</b><br/><br/>Act 1<br/><br/>The crew is preparing to dock in one of their favourite haunts, New Orleans, late 24th century, 4th of July. Plenty of temporal swashbuckers here, but a ripple across time and space wipes out the place they know. Prior to the ripple; Fireworks, American flags, Festivity. Post-ripple; Explosives, Chinese Flags, Bloodshed.<br/><br/>The identify a divergence in the timeline, Abraham Lincoln was not assassinated. They'll have to go back and make sure he dies. If the timeline is to be restored close to the way we know it, they'll have to replicate one of the many conspiracy theories to enact their assassination attempt.  <br/><br/>Act 2<br/><br/>The crew head back through time and space, landing in Washington DC a few days before the scheduled assassination. The ship's undead cook intimidates locals with his skillet to track down John Wilkes Booth, he has been poisoned. One of the crew members decides to masquerade as Booth. One of the characters is a Mexican revolutionary, and the player of this character spends the relevant currency to make "Pancho Villa" another time traveler present in the scenario. More temporal ripples and many members of the crew suffer changes as they are affected by the fluctuations of the timestream, some change gender, others change ethnicity, and a few mutate into inhuman forms. <br/><br/>Act 3<br/><br/>One of the crew members fails a challenge and ends up in prison, requiring a jailbreak scene. The captain has remained on board the ship and blasts a hole through the jail, but does more damage than good. The mexican revolutionary has decided that the timestream is a bit too damaged to remedy, so they ask the mad Russian steampunk scientist to introduce efficient gatling guns to the Mexicans a few years too early. The undead cook has transformed into a clockwork golem through a temporal ripple and someone introduces the concept of clockwork "Fascinations" into the game, the night at the opera has now turned into a pre-burlesque show of clockwork can-can and steampunk vaudevillian humour. Other crew members work on an antidote for the real Booth.<br/><br/>Act 4<br/><br/>The crew member masquerading as Booth sneaks into the theatre and shoots lincoln. He fails his roll dismally. The captain is actually a member of the Bavarian Illuminati and a sorcerous illusionist. He makes it look like Lincoln has been shot. The crew bundle up an unconscious John Wilkes Booth, leaving him in a barn where he will be historically found weeks later.  <br/><br/>Act 5<br/><br/>Many of the events of actual history have generally been restored, each of the players has a final chance to restore reality. In the end, Mexico becomes a much greater power in the world, with clockwork gatling guns...and the crew are now on the run from Integrity Marines for their crimes against the timeline. <br/><br/><b>Quincunx (A game about reality TV supernatural hunters)</b> <br/><br/>I'll cut this down to the best scene:<br/><br/>In the same location on the map are two things, 1) the central distribution centre for mail in Sydney, Australia, 2) Rookwood Cemetery, the largest cemetery in the southern hemisphere with over 1,000,000 bodies buried.<br/><br/>A player uncovers the fact that there is something mystical within the area, and we allow players to set their own scene framing.<br/><br/>The player decides that he'll deal with potentially flesh eating (or blood drinking) undead, because a building filled with a thousand postal workers is far scarier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Bite-Size AP: September 2009 - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10330/bite-size-ap-september-2009/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Bite-Size AP: September 2009 - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10330/bite-size-ap-september-2009/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="D&amp;D4E last night!

I don't even know what it means, as in "Who's your little cockmonkey?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the characters were dumped from their superpowerful bodies into a chain gang being beaten up by orcs, and I handed them new, temporary character sheets.

They had to open a gate to get back to their original bodies and come through to kick the arses of their tormentors. It was satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters are scum, and yet they completely reworked an assassination attempt, at great personal risk to avoid harming some little flower girls who were delivering a bouquet to the Empress of the Iron Throne. In the end it was death by 18-ton granite block falling from above through a Disintegrated Wall of Force, finally delivering the crushed victim to Gehanna through a pre-prepared Gate in a pit in the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guy with the big life-absorbing sword rolled three 20s in a row, slaughtering three horrific opponents.

I ended up tailoring the night's content pretty well to our "abbreviated" play footprint; in my head, we're playing through a half-hour political drama teevee show, not a full hour, which fits our available three-and-a-half hours pretty well.<br/><br/>My three players were instantly at each others' throats, even without the earthquake destabilizing the neighboring barony.<br/><br/>The unmarried Moryandal Thorne extended hospitality to her unlucky neighbor Bail Uvan and his two unmarried sons and sent their destroyed castle a relief caravan.  Of course, said caravan was harboring a spy that contacted the unmarried baron on the other side of Bail's land, with a combined mission of scoping out marriage prospects and coordinating conquest.  She didn't tell either of the other PCs about caravan or spy (although another PC did find out...).<br/><br/>Rajh Yvarai spent most of the story avoiding his wife, the niece of Bail Uvan, while at the same time sending the beleaguered visiting ven whores to make sure they were comfortable.  He oversaw the contract negotiations with the neighbors, winning rights to explore their ruins and a hefty payment for all three PCs in exchange for a few season actions on their part.  By the terms of the contract, the PCs decide when and where everything goes down, so they can string poor Bail along indefinitely. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Niassa Burghe moved her men into her absent liege's castle, to "protect" it while the Countess was away.  When the staff started getting suspicious, she gave them a massive feast, which only served to erode their loyalties to the Countess further.

The movie we ended up playing was The Walkers: a southern family ranch on a thanksgiving day in early 80s. Huge storm outside. The Walkers, a family with strong roots, oil money and not so bright future have gathered together once more. The head of the family, Bobby Walker Sr. is found murdered in the smoking room. Ominous clues about the family's not so glorious past start to uncover. An angry spirit manifests, threatening the relatives and eventually killing a house maid. <br/><br/>The unholy signs that are found all around the ranch are revealed as protection from an angry spirit. The angry spirit is uncovered to be the grand daughter of Bobby Sr., the spawn of a sinful joining with Bobby Sr. and his own daughter Jane, buried alive in the cellar to conceal the shame to the family. It becomes apparent that the rest of the Walkers weren't innocent after all but instead enablers in a horrible tragedy. The justice is served as the spirit of the victim takes out Walker after another. A few bystanders are slaughtered too. Finally only Bobby Jr., the reluctant heir, and Larry, family friend and a detective are left, taking refuge in Bobby Sr.'s secret occult study. The spirit comes to claim Bobby Jr. too who takes his own life as he cannot live with the guilt. Larry gives rest to the spirit by firing a silver bullet through its earthly shell.<br/><br/>Months later a family from Wisconsin moves to the now-abandoned Walker ranch.<br/><br/>We had a blast! We were winging it a lot, not confining to the responsibilities to the framing and character-playing players in respective scenes. But it worked well so I think that was for the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234815/#Comment_234815" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T04:44:07+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  4:44AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie Gilb</cite>One player murdered her husband.</blockquote>\nHere's hoping you meant character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234835/#Comment_234835" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T07:10:48+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  7:10AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2009 10:49AM by Charlie Gilb.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite><cite>Posted By: Charlie Gilb</cite>One player murdered her husband.</blockquote>\nHere's hoping you meant character.<br/><br/>Being that the player was my wife, yes.<br/><br/>&gt;.&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;.&lt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234870/#Comment_234870" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T09:49:34+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  9:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Josh: Is this the Twitter one?

Second encounter had a lot of space and motion against a pair of harpies and a carrion crawler brood.  The ranger ruled that one, critting on his daily and, in one fell swoop, taking my harpy squadron from "barely bloodied" to "dead" and "dying." <br/><br/>But those were two tough fights, and the party had hit them straight after making a marathon trek through hard weather and harder country.

We only played for a bit, in which our Sewerjacks as a reward for their heroism have been banished to the Deep Patrols (the poor sods who have to explore the oldest parts) and stumble across a murdered patrol of 'jacks. With a failed Murder-wise roll, the only evidence they can find of Skaven is of the crazy kind - when you shine a candle in the eye of the corpse you can see a rats shadow... so it must be Skaven! Then on their way out they are ambushed by unknown creatures who drop some sort of green glass ball filled with poison in their midst!
