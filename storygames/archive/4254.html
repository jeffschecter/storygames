I've playtested it twice, but only once with the current vignette guidelines - the first go was a bit more unscripted and unstructured, and it felt like it lacked support.<br/><br/><a href="http://joepub.fileave.com/TheExhumationofaStranger.pdf" rel="nofollow">Download Here.</a><br/><br/>I'm pretty confident that this current form can create consistantly cool play experiences. Tell me what you think.<br/><br/>The basic gyst:<br/>You have four pages. Each contains a brief description of what the game is, and a player Role.<br/>You play the game with either 2 or 4 players. Each player either gets 1 or 2 Roles.<br/>Starting with the Grave Robber Role and ending with the Awakened, you go around and each add a vignette to the story.<br/>A vignette is a independantly-standing but interconnected short story.<br/>Each vignette has guidelines to create a certain ambiance and type of story.<br/><br/>The goals:<br/>game play in 15-30 minutes. (so far, this has worked out great)<br/>Everyone gets their own (relevant) rule set, so that there is no "one book" situation. Nobody has to read over someone else's shoulder.<br/>a deeply immersive experience, without necessarily having "character control".<br/>a game that is challenging but accessible to old hands and new players alike.<br/>Diceless, statless... basically freeform play.<br/>A game which puts emphasis on listening to others and incorporating what they do into what you do.<br/><br/>Potential issues:<br/>Victim phase still seems so abstract.<br/>Victim phase relies heavily on a really active and expansive imagination.<br/>Awakened phase, the instructions are basically "be witty and slick". That's not cool or fair to put on that player.<br/><br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95635/#Comment_95635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T15:41:51+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  3:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            iago had mentioned, in my planning thread, that the first two roles seemed conversational and the second two really isolated and removed.<br/><br/>The solution that I integrated was to have a lot of the "things to consider" for Victim and Awakened stem from the previous roles. The idea is that you have to be looking for opportunities for reincorporation and mirroring for your own scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95663/#Comment_95663" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T16:15:49+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  4:15PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a lot of time right now so I can't offer much of a reading based feeback, but looking at the PDF (fix your link!) I REALLY like the format choice you've gone for -- treating each page as a handout.  Very nice, unexpected incorporation of one of the design restrictions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
