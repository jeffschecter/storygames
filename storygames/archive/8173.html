At the time I didn't have any thoughts on the matter - I'd been thinking that we'll get the text of the game available in html sooner or later anyway, so nobody would want to buy a PDF. Several folks told me that they wanted to give me money for a pdf version, though, so I put it on my to-do list to create just that.<br/><br/>Now I've finally had time to lay out a reasonably readable pdf version (assuming you're using my computer to read it, anyway), so we can start selling it. This is my first time selling pdf files, so if there's some technical problems or improvements that come up later, we'll just have to keep sending buyers fixed versions until we get it right. Shouldn't be a problem, though, as Solar System is pretty simple content-wise - just text and grayscale images, really. The delivery system is simple at this point as well: pay us through the Paypal button and receive your copy of the game by email whenever my brother Jari next gets around to reading his email.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/shop#ARK204" rel="nofollow">Here's the pdf in our web store.</a><br/><a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/shop#ARK205" rel="nofollow">Here's the group license version in our web store.</a><br/><br/>As you can see, I'm considering a separate group license here for those who want to pay more for the privilege of spreading the pdf around like syphilis (that is, through intimate contact). Should be an interesting experiment; I'm not sure I like how this sort of means that I'm leeching more money from the extremely law-abiding minority here, while the more relaxed majority will do what they want with the pdf, anyway. On the other hand, perhaps some folks will find it positive that they can pay for permission to do what they're going to be doing anyway. On the third hand, one might argue that most pdf publishers already give at least an implicit permission for a single game group to share the pdf amongst themselves; at least I've never seen anybody complain about this widespread practice. On the fourth hand, it's an open question for us here in Finland whether the licensor of this sort of stuff even can limit consumption in this manner, so for all I know you'd be within the law to do whatever you want with the cheaper license, too. A tricky issue, feel free to comment on it if you have some thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179805/#Comment_179805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T17:59:04+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  5:59PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2008 6:38PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, this is something I've wanted to try for a while:<br/><br/><div id="attachment_77"><a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/wp-content/uploads/sscoverweb.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Click to enlarge" height="150" src="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/wp-content/uploads/sscoverweb.png" title="Solar System Cover" width="194"/></a><p>Click to enlarge</p></div><div><h3>Solar System PDF</h3><table border="0"><tbody><tr><th>Name:</th><td>Solar System PDF</td></tr><tr><th>Product\xa0#:</th><td>ARK204</td></tr><tr><th>Price:</th><td>5 \u20ac</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>The Solar System in PDF.

Blame the currencies, blasted abstract concepts refuse to stay put.<br/><br/>I just put it at 5 \u20ac because that's what the print version is going for here in Europe, and I couldn't be bothered to mess about with different currencies in the shop. Would get confusing for the customers, too, I imagine. I considered having this pdf stuff available both in euros and dollars, but that'd be just stupid, ultimately - you'd have to figure out which currency is currently cheaper and buy in that. At least this way we're being logical, and also do our bit in getting Americans out of their ill-fitting position in the center of the economical world.<br/><br/>And Brand, your plan seems quite appropriate to me. Just remember to only give the pdf to those people you're actually going to be playing with - that is my secret incentive for playing Solar System, you get this valuable pdf file you'd do nothing with if you weren't going to play with it... which, paradoxically, might mean that it's worth nothing.

I could have just sold the vertical version, too, I guess, but I wanted to provide a little bit of extra value for anybody who ends up getting both a paper and a pdf version. And of course I needed to add bookmarks and such, it took a bit of time to figure out those parts. Not a lot of work by any means, but it took me a surprisingly long time to get around to doing it, what with all the other things that compete for my days nowadays.<br/><br/>As for the pdf delivery set-up, it's manual mostly because we haven't done this sort of thing before and I like building from ground up in any new endeavour. Once Jari gets bored with mailing the pdf I'll probably program something to create a server-based license database to control access to the file. Probably will conincide with creating a more elaborate web store if we start feeling like needing such. But as long as the greatest sales peaks are something like half a dozen customers in a day, it's not that much trouble doing everything by hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180154/#Comment_180154" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T19:56:46+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  7:56PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, obviously I've personally underestimated the vivacity of the pdf market rather drastically, considering that we've reached my target sales in just two days.

No upfront fee and at low sales volumes, no fees of any kind. <br/><br/>I use it for MP3s and it works fine.
