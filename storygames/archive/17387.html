I'm working on a from near-scratch take on Mage (either version), with a very story-game style set of mechanics that I hope will fit my players and maybe some others down the line. I'm drawing a lot of mechanical inspiration from PDQ, AW, ORE, and Hollowpoint. <br/><br/>I've killed Paradox, Spheres, Traditions, Attributes, and abilities. <br/><br/>The core of the system is that only players roll dice. When it comes to pickup the dice, what matters is the end goal of the action. <i>I want Dieter to leave the room in shame</i>.  The player than rolls dice equal to their rating (1-5) in one of six Methods: Brain, Brute, Con, Charm, Savvy, and Moxie, based on how they wish to accomplish the task. Player defined Specialties, such as "I Come First," "Ferocious Temper," Keen Eye," can add a die to the roll. <br/><br/>The difficulty of the task (normally 1) is the minimum number that is allowed when building a set of matches. Zero dice is a failure - the player doesn't succeed and they take a "damage" to the rolled Method, lowering it by one for future rolls. One die results in either a success and a "damage" or a "Yes, But" outcome. A set of two or more is a total success. Each Method has a number of "health levels" equal to (Rating/2). When all of you Methods are toast, so are you (no Narrative control).<br/><br/>Magical attributes, Mysteries, are the four key pillars to their paradigm. They are player names and also rated 1-5. The higher the rating the more powerful the effect, however, the difficulty (minimum die value for sets), increases. To create an effect, a player states their goal, and consults a chart to build, and rolls a Method against the difficulty. Effects change the time, scope, range, blatancy, and power (set X dice to Y) of the roll. Taking additional time, effort, etc can decrease the difficulty. Failure/Partial success can result in Resonance, that makes future die rolls more difficult, results in magical weirdness, or "damages" the Method (the player chooses).<br/><br/>Finally, Backgrounds are resources the character has to assist them, Aid, Cash, Clout, Intel, Lore, Luck, and Mojo. They are also rated 1-5 and can be expended for an immediate, Narrative gimme, <i>I use Clout to get us into the club, My Mojo allows me to easily toss a fireball at this mook</i>, or reduce the difficulty of an action by one.<br/><br/>You can take a look at the current character sheet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download/270949216360189/blcksqre2.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Alex wants to ESCAPE THE SCUFFLE are rolls his Savvy, to survey his environment and find a quick escape - a fire escape! The difficulty is 1 and he rolls 2, 4. No matches - He opts for a complication, and Alex is potted halfway up the ladder. A mook opens fire. Alex begins to tell the story of The Cornered Hero as he struggles up the ladder. The player wants to decrease the time it takes to scale the ladder, and ensure he rolls well (+2 difficulty) rolls Charm (adding his Specialty). For good measure he uses Mojo, as he doesn't have time to prep the spell. The difficulty is 3 and he rolls 1, 2, 4, 5. His spell lets him turn a die into another number, so with a set of 5s he escapes.<br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nunboi" title="nunboi"><img alt="nunboi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nunboi">nunboi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393854/#Comment_393854" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T01:33:15+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  1:33AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magic is tricky business. When a Mage fails when making a magic roll, there is no external force acting upon them, instead their doubt/residual belief in the status-quo, quashes their effort. With both failures and partial successes, this magic is left in the open, lingering. This is noted by checking boxes next to the Mystery used to create the effect.<br/><br/>It's this magical resonance and doubt that plague a Mage. Each checked box increases the difficulty (target number for matches) by 1, increasing the chance of failure. This resonance can be bled off in one of two ways.<br/><br/>First, at the player's discretion, in magical effects that they cannot control - ex. <i>With 4 resonance in his Stories of Heroism, Alex, if confronted by a man intent on not only saving him, but inviting him to joining his adventuring party; no amount of cajoling will send him away</i>. After the experience, Alex's resonance in the trait is decreased by 1.<br/><br/>Alternatively, a layer can reaffirm their power by winning! Any success on an spell effected by resonance reduces the resonance by 1, as they retake control of their will.<br/><br/>I'm a bit torn on the second option, but it seems to work to not punish players, and at the same time encourage them to make poor choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394383/#Comment_394383" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T18:47:57+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  6:47PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.
