                    I think a lot of people come up with circular logic when answering this question, so bear with me.<br/><br/>Why is it OK to have detailed rules for physical combat, but not for social or intelectual combat? I can rip your head off and shit down your neck, but I can't intimidate you or torture you into breaking?<br/><br/>Where is the logic in this?                </div>

                            Common reasons:<br>
<br>
* Death is the one surrender of character control that many players are comfortable with - Social and intellectual combat generally requires a surrender of character control ("I don't _want_ to back down") that violates the core principal of play for many players, that it it _their_ characters.  Even explicit forces (like charm spells) are not as intrusive as determing what a charcter _wants_ to do.  There are soem holes in this reaosning, and it can be addressed both through trust or through comfortable mechanics, but it is a genuine, visceral knee-jerk response that makes up in sincerity and emotional strength what it loses in intellectual rigor.  In the end, even if the character dies, ti still is MY character when it dies.<br/>
<br/>
* Poor metrics.  Take every argument about what a terrible model Hit Points are and multiply it times 1000.  Physical combat rules may have a lot of options and depth in play, but the underlying model of watching the health bar tick down remains a very simple foundation.  Net result: Most systems for doign it suck, and those that don't require buying into the model, which is its own sales pitch.<br/>
<br/>
* Relative youth - As an extension of this, wargaming had a lot of history when it started rolling into roleplaying, and much of the model is build upon a strong foundation of that history, either directly, or in response to it.  Social combat is much younger, so it's going to suck for a while.<br/>
<br/>
* Isn't that the point of roleplaying? - A lot of players just wouldn't see the need for a system, since this is the stuff they "play out".  Whether this is because they are comforable with free form interaction or if it means they view this as a competition won through acting and argument can vary from place to place.  And heck, some people just like to talk.<br/>
<br/>
* Why the hell take the time? - There is a persuasive (and self perpetuating) logic that says the rules density should correlate with interest level.  Fighting and dungeoneering is interesting, debates aren't.  Stick with what works! The corrolary of this is of course "It's expected combat is detailed, so it will be".<br/>
<br/>
* Fruitful Void - Probably misusing the term, but I look at the games that have th emost satisfying non-combat conflicts (Amber, Ars Magica) and they tend to do so because of a rich setting and a strong framework that allows for the contests to be meaningful.  With that, they don't _need_ full combat systems.  Of course, these systems also work with light combat systems too, so they mostly exist to make it clear this isn't an either-or sort of situation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, if someone came to me with one of these reasons, I'd probably argue with them, but for most of them (except why take the time) I'd be content with their reasoning.<br/>

It's just conventions of the gaming culture:<br/>
*Armor and gunfire must be "realistic", but intimidating someone? Fuck no, don't roll the dice, Act it out and the GM will determine whether you succeed or not (or give you a small bonus to your single social die roll).<br/>
<br/>
The game that fixes this convention for as many people as possible is, IMO, Dogs in the Vineyard.  Between "Say Yes or Roll the Dice", and the fact that you can min-max a social character and run social brawls that make physical combat look slow and dull, that game was a bomb on that gaming convention.<br/>
<br/>
Heroquest and TSOY are also up there with "Social conflicts can be more exciting than physical combat, using dice and the like" resolution.                        </div>

                            I think a lot of it -- in the mainstream, anyway -- has to do with a common gaming style that focuses a lot on "acting the part of the character." If it's a negotiation or other verbal human interaction, it's way more satisfying to "play it out" than to turn to a randomizer or something.<br/>
<br/>
I think, though I'm only guessing, that that style of player would prefer an up-front "you win, so let's play it out that way" method than a step-by-step procedure where you pause every so often to make a roll or draw a card. I'd like the latter, but plenty of other gamers wouldn't.                        </div>

                            Yah, Matt's point deserves some magnification.  Assume that player A gets his enjoyment from the crunchy combat, and player B gets his enjoyment form playing stuff out.  In a normal game, they basically end up alternating their payouts, and it works out ok.  If play switches to a mechanical resolution rather than, shall we say, acting, then suddenly player B isn't getting his payout.  Now, Player A is now possibly gettign a double playout, so while it may be zero sum, it's probably a bad decision for the game.<br/>
<br/>
Put another way, I know many player who frame it as this: they want rules and resolution for the things they _can't_ do.  They can't have fights, pick locks, or climb walls (though thank NERO, some try) so they project that duty onto the game.  They _can_ however talk, think, intrigue charm and scheme so the game woudl merely get in their way.<br/>
<br/>
At it's most extreme, you may encounter players who will actively disdain social rules as a crutch for people who "can't roleplay".  While this position has more holes than a cheese grater, its proponents are often quite passionate about it.<br/>

<p>I'm not sure I agree! It's certainly not a great solution <em>if you want to keep that specific group of players and their goals</em> intact, but <em>do</em> you? Can you realign Player B's goals so that he and Player A are having fun at the same time, rather than in complementary distribution, or discard Player B?</p>
<p>It seems, to me, like either of those strategies ends in greater average fun payout than "we take turns having fun" does.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On rules for what you can't do... what inspires that distinction? I find it hard to understand "I don't need rules for stuff I can do"; that seems to lead directly to "my character is exactly as capable as I am wrt stuff the rules don't handle", and that doesn't sound like a property you definitely want all games to have.</p>
<p>So, what am I missing about that logic?</p>

                            Oh my god, what a can of worms...<br/><br/>As a long-time Vampire LARP player, I cannot begin to tell you the problems with having a half-assed social mechanic system that is not quite in character and not quite out of character (to wit, Status).  The problem with having a similar system for physical combat and other forms of combat is that the physical interaction is totally in the space of the game, but the mental and social elements are at least partially provided by the player (at least in games where the players actively and consistantly portray one character; I believe the proper jargon is "Actor stance").  That doesn't mean that social and mental systems such as those SHOULDN'T exist, only that it's harder to extract them from the social and mental space of the player than purely physical conflict.  As such, I suspect most designers handwave the problem away.  The reverse option (putting physical conflict into the space of the players along with social and mental conflicts) is really only reserved for boffer LARPs and things that should happen in the privacy of other people's bedrooms.                        </div>

<br/>
At one time there was another similar thread back on RPGNet ("I make the players roll for attacks and rope use, but interactions we all do in character only with no dice") where I turned the tables to make a point: That is, all the combat should be done 'realistically', with at least wooden weapons, as an insistence on being in character for social rolls is kinda the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
In my Thursday group, half of us are theatre fags, the other half are sociable, but not "good on our feet" (I fall squarely between the two camps).  We certainly do act out everything, or at least attempt to, but we know our limits.<br/>
<br/>
Ex: If I say my character gets "angry" and "intimidates", I'll usually say:<br/>
"I'm angry, and I intimidate the fuck out of them. How should I roll?" <br/>
<br/>
I just know what my limits are with "acting". Maybe I'll say a line or two from a character's rant/speech/intimidation, but I probably won't go through the entire motion. It would be like someone describing how their Feng Shui guy does a backflip-kick, and actually doing a backflip kick.  I could TRY, but it wouldn't be PRETTY.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that with games with systems where you always have the power to influence, control, resolve conflicts and "kick ass" with social powers and rolls, stuck in a system that's as exciting as traditional combat, that's when we see the magic of the next generation of games.  Exalted, Dogs, The Shadow of Yesterday, Heroquest... they all have alternate conflict resolution, and because of it they make people like us rather happy.                        </div>

Bear with me, this is my half-assed idea that I came up with over the weekend; I'll need to give some context.<br/><br/>My most recent CiaB column in Pyramid -- "Galaxy Prix" -- basically "<i>Speed Racer</i> in space" -- was less-well recieved (by virtue of having a lower rating) than I expected. It was actually my fourth-lowest rated CiaB.<br/><br/>This shocked me a bit, because of elements of "common wisdom" regarding the average Pyramid reader: they tend to like sci-fi, and they tend to like anime. Yet they didn't dig this space race opera. Intriguing.<br/><br/>I took a look at the other three low rated articles: one of them was seen as a railroad-fest, one had a whole bunch of focus on playing the corp execs in a vague cyberpunk world rather than street samurai, and the last was a sports campaign (imagine a cross between Calvinball and Nomic).<br/><br/>Now, surely all these columns had their own flaws. But something struck me, not just about the ratings, but the comment threads sparked by each.<br/><br/>I think combat is the preferred conflict over, say, sports and business because you can ultimately "win" combat permanently. That is, with sports, even if you win the Super Cup, you gotta play next season. With business, if you break sales records with your Pet Sock product, next quarter, sales will probably drop and you've got to find a new thing to push (like Pickle-Me Elmo!).<br/><br/>Then I started thinking about other comments from gamers on their hatred of recurring villains in their games. While some folks love 'em, they quickly wear out their welcome after their third appearance, and by cameo six, player -- not character -- frustration starts to kick in. Many players want to make sure Dr. Nastypants will <b>never</b> come back again, and start going for kill shots (even if they're playing Mr. Lantern Jaw I Believe in the Sanctity of Life).<br/><br/>Also, the majority of comics fans I hear who bitch that Batman should just kill the Joker tend to be gamers.<br/><br/>(Anecdotes are fun!)<br/><br/>So, I think the predominence of combat reflects the player's need to "totally and irrevocably win" by killing their opponent dead, dead, dead, because they cannot countenance having to go back and do it all again multiple times -- repeated attempts to do something (and repeated/future failures) remind them too much of day-to-day life.<br/><br/>For example, in the corp-exec cyberpunk setting, one comment I received was that "if I wanted to worry about business concerns, I'd stay at work."<br/><br/>My response was something along the lines of "You see no difference between whatever your day job is and playing a Vice President of a futuristic megacorp in a particularly melodramatic and soap opera-y world? (shrug) Well, good on you, man. I know it's certainly different from my job to be interesting."<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

                            Hey Chad, Pyramid is a pretty narrow and self-selecting audience, though - do you think your point applies broadly across gamers in general?  Is there a distinction between dirty hippie gamers and old skool gamers (yes)?  Between groups with divergent play styles?  <br/><br/>This thread makes me think about TSOY, where you can't even slay a named NPC under normal circumstances - that can be your intention, and you can think you slew him, but you didn't - not unless very specific and personally dangerous criteria are met.

                            [tags Andy and enters the ring again]<br/><br/><i>I think that with games with systems where you always have the power to influence, control, resolve conflicts and "kick ass" with social powers and rolls, stuck in a system that's as exciting as traditional combat, that's when we see the magic of the next generation of games. Exalted, Dogs, The Shadow of Yesterday, Heroquest... they all have alternate conflict resolution, and because of it they make people like us rather happy.</i><br/><br/>This actually helped me realize where I was going with my original point.  Combat, as well as social and mental conflict systems, should be universally <i>optional</i>.  If players want to RP a scene of social conflict, they can.  If they want to just roll dice at it and make it go away, they can do that too. However, they should be able to do the same thing with combat ("Hey, can we just say my PC takes 5 Wounds and we mop up all these henchmen?" or, better yet, a detailed description of the combat).  Will that happen?  I'm not sure, because it does take a <i>lot</i> of reprogramming.  While I agree that combat is the system Most Likely to Make You A New Character, it's not universally so.  Examples include a character being socially snubbed permanently (which, for a game on courtly politics, might as well be a death sentence) or something like the scene in Resevoir Dogs where everyone's pointing a gun at everyone else and they're all trying to talk each other down (HITTING your opponent isn't the conflict; talking him out of hitting YOU is).<br/><br/>I keep kicking around an idea for "social wounds."  This came from my dissatisfaction with V:tM/V:tR/MET Status, and is very appropriate for that kind of political game: every political action you take comes with a resolution mechanic, and you take social wounds much like physical wounds.  They give you social penalties, and eventually you "die" (get kicked out of the city, get declared Caitiff, get Blood Hunted, whatever).  You can "heal" by attempting social recouperation (throwing parties, public apologies, doing favors for important people, and so on).  Owing a favor over someone acts as "armor" (their attacks do less social damage because it's known they owe you a favor), and political title gives you extra "health levels" (it's not that you're invulnerable; it just takes a lot more damage to bring you down).<br/><br/>I recall something like this involving Unknown Armies, but it's escaping me now...                        </div>

                            OK, if the spectrum is wide enough, everybody piles on somewhere.  And death always adds a certain frisson to a game.  <br/><br/>It is interesting to look at "character death" as another way of expressing hard limits on player control, and to search for other satisfying and interesting limits.  I'm really into constraining player decision-making and I don't think death needs to be the only  switch.  I'm working on a game where you are pretty much required to fall in love, but the alternative is death again.  Hmm.                        </div>

                            Here's a thought:<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people FEAR social conflict rules because it means:<br/>
<br/>
a) players can convince NPCs to do things (loss of control for the GM)<br/>
b) PCs can also potentially be convinced (loss of control for a player)<br/>
<br/>
Does a character being dead mean you lose control?  Sure, but it doesn't "solve" a lot of typical adventures like reasonable convincing might.  "Hey dragon-dude, I'll tell you what, we'll give you the uber-mystic scroll if you leave the people in the valley alone, how's that sound?"                        </div>

<p>Hm. I'm not sure I'm parsing your wording effectively here, Chris.</p>
<p>Are you saying that death is a comparable loss of control, but it doesn't have the same utility for the control-usurper that these social effects do?</p>
<p>That is to say, it causes someone to <em>lose</em> control, but no one actually gets that control because the item in question is no longer available, and therefore it's nonthreatening?</p>
<p>I agree with that statement, but I'm not sure that it's the one you were trying to make.</p>

                            Shryeas, I think Chris means that this happens when you look at a traditional D&amp;D adventure:<br/>
<br/>
Player: "We go right up to the dragon and negotiate with it." (rolls and "succeeds" in a ruleset where social rules are as big as combat to resolve conflict)<br/>
<br/>
GM: "Well fuck, you win, there goes all my scenario preparation. Game over. I don't have anything more, we're done for today."<br/>
<br/>
With newer modes of play we don't see this, really, but the fear that the above is what a pre-planned adventure can come down to is harrowing for traditional players.                        </div>

<br/>
Most traditional games can plan for combats, because it boils down to a simple win/lose branch of options- whereas, once you open things up to, "I trick her" "I seduce him" "I cut a deal" "I betray the King" etc.  things no longer are so easy to branch and predict. <br/>
<br/>
A dead character does not change the basic power structure of GM guides, players follow, whereas having the ability to become best friends with the uber-NPC and have them stomp your enemies for you -does-.                        </div>

Maybe you need to give the Dragon a hammering to squelch its Pride, before talking it down. Getting close enough to the dragon to launch that potion might demand a cool head and eloquent voice. <br/><br/>There's a kind of hint of this even in traditional games with things like testing for rout, but it doesn't follow through (Your blow shakes the goblin, who snivels and curls up in a ball. You tie him up and demand to know the enemies plans. GM smiles: the goblin would rather die than tell!); indie games do it but generally through a single system (dogs, capes, probably more but I don't know them) - although I think there's a hint of this joined up quality in burning wheel, if the fight mechanics can deliver successes to a linked test.

<blockquote><i>...is physical combat really so different from other goal-directed behaviour?</i></blockquote>
I see a player being able to say, "My character won't do that," in a social context far more than a physical one.  "My character won't take a bullet wound," is acceptable in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very few</span> games whereas, "My character won't betray his mistress!" is, perhaps, far more playable.  <br/><br/>Shouting, "I rolled a twenty! Not only does he betray his mistress, but he gives her social security number, bloodtype, and patterns of behaviour to the enemy!" just... I don't know. Seems cruel. [laughing]  Shouting, "I rolled a twenty!  GUT WOUND! GUT WOUND!!" is while (perhaps) juvenile, generally the point of the scene.  <br/><br/>Here's the twist, at least the way I see it: mesmerisation, charm, and character rape may be past a certain acceptable line on a particular continuum for players.      While I am not a character purist to the point where I say ANY GM intervention "breaks my character concept" even a charm spell may do that for another player.  <br/><br/>"Death" may break a character concept, but it's something that I risk in the game, and enough verbiage has been written on that to make it seem easy to say, "It's best when you do it with purpose and meaning."  The same, at least in my opinion, follows for social conflicts.                        </div>

                            Hey, man.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you include rape on the continuum that starts with "charm."  Rape is an act of violence, more similar to sticking someone with a sword than convincing them of the rightness of your cause.<br/>

                            But surely "I chop your arms and legs off...to rape you" falls even further on such a continuum?<br/><br/>EDIT: but what I mean is, rape is a consequence that can even MORE obviously be produced by physical coercion.

                            I totally don't understand why "I stab you" isn't right before "I rape you" on said continuum.  One of an act of (possibly non-sexual) violence.  One is an act of (decidedly sexual) violence.  But they're both violent.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if we're not actually addressing violence in the game, that's fine.  Maybe we've been indoctrinated by nintendo to say "(theoretically) non-sexual violence is fine, sexual violence is not fine," which is a massive trivialization of violence.  But if we're going to trivialize violence why bother to have a system for any violent action?<br/>

                            My apologies, Ben, I did not mean that "charm" was the beginning of the continuum, but that it was near the same end.  Mesmerisation (I keep thinking there MIGHT be a "z" in that word, but I'm not entirely certain) is one step closer, and something like "charm person" or even "hold person" closer still, if you ask me.  <br/>
<br/>
I kept thinking of the classic vampiric example: "Dracula" versus your average member of the Van Helsing Society.  <br/>
<br/>
"Dracula catches your gaze."  <br/>
<br/>
How do you run this conflict?  "I fight against him with my [will, or other related statistic.]"  The player suggests that he or she is going to use their character sheet terms.  "I fight against him using the love of my sister, who was his last victim," is a little different, but might still depend on "points in relationship with sister," of whatever flavour.  "I bite back!"  I'm moving it into a physical arena if I can.  "I allow him into my mind, but think of extremely dirty thoughts to distract him..." that's a social conflict, and in the hands of the GM.                        </div>

<blockquote><i>I see a player being able to say, "My character won't do that," in a social context far more than a physical one. "My character won't take a bullet wound," is acceptable in very few games whereas, "My character won't betray his mistress!" is, perhaps, far more playable.</i></blockquote>
This is a good example of a difference in scale, which is something that comes up a lot when this issue is discussed.<br/><br/>What I mean is, "You betray your mistress," is an outcome, not a discrete event. "You take a bullet wound," is a discrete event, not an outcome.<br/><br/>To really compare these, we need to choose two similar items. I think these are equivalent:<br/>(roll, you lose) "You betray your mistress."<br/>(roll, you lose) "You are defeated in combat."<br/><br/>I think it's equally odd for a player to say "I won't betray my mistress," or "I won't be defeated in combat." Both of these assume the unspoken addition of "never, under any circumstances," which is pretty silly. Of course it's <i>possible</i> for your character to be defeated in combat. How? Why? Well, we can play it out many different ways and find out. Likewise, it's <i>possibe</i> for your character to betray his mistress. How? Why? We'll find out (either before or after the roll -- or a mix -- depending on the system in use).<br/><br/>A lot of games mix scales like this, though, and it distresses players. They're used to rolling for the flight of a single bullet when they're fighting (discrete events) and then suddenly they get tossed into large-scale outcomes when "social rolls" come into play. It can feel like they're losing control over their character's actions.<br/><br/>A system that handles scale well can help avoid this problem.                        </div>

                            What John and Chris have said. <br/>
<br/>
This all comes down to how people are accustomed to framing forms of conflict. Physical is no easier than mental, it's very simply just what most people are used to in RPGs. Once you get in the habit of being able to create reasonable stakes for conflicts, then all distinction of type of contest goes away, and it all becomes a single organic whole. <br/>
<br/>
I got to this point playing HQ quite a while ago. People draw swords, or fling words, and there is absolutely no difference in feel mechanically in play between the two things. That is, some physical acts we do not use the resolution system for (or, rather, we use the "automatic success" or "automatic failure" systems included, to be technical). Some social acts we do not either. The key is in being able to identify when a conflict becomes interesting to have. Which, once you start doing it, is as easy as knowing that it's time to start a combat in D&amp;D. <br/>
<br/>
Easier, actually. Here's the mystical process. When you think it might be fun to have a contest, one where everyone will like the possible positive or negative outcomes of the contest, you speak up and say, "Hey, contest about X?" The other players will agree or disagree. When everyone agrees (tacitly, potentially, in addition to actively), you have a contest around the issue indicated. <br/>
<br/>
I postulate that this works for all play. Even in the most gamism driven game, if none of the participants is really interested in a particular contest, then it's not worth doing - what'll happen, however, is that in the name of challenge, players will accept most conflicts. But even in some games you'll see the GM say, "Ah, it's just a bucha kobolds, you guys just plow them under - let's move on."<br/>
<br/>
The problem, really, is the idea that RPG resolution systems exist to turn "let's pretend" into a game where you can't say, "You missed!" when shot at. So many game texts say this, and so many people actually sorta adhere to this in their agenda for play. But it's really wrong. We don't do conflicts in RPGs to prevent the other players from "cheating." Like all "games" we expect that they won't cheat as part of the criteria for allowing them to play in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
We do conflicts in RPGs because they add something interesting to the play. For gamism it's where you get to show off your tactical ability. For simulationism, it's the engine that makes the world function "as it should" or "like it's real." For narrativism, resolution systems are springboards providing information to spur more interesting situation. <br/>
<br/>
Roughly speaking. <br/>
<br/>
Once people get past the idea that there are some sort of perfunctory places that resolution has to be used, in order to keep things "fair" or something, and that resolution is a tool used to tell the tale in a RPG, to be used when it's interesting to everyone to do so....once you get to this point, suddenly the whole notion of one sort of conflict being neccessarily any different than another just vanishes into thin air. <br/>
<br/>
Like Chris says, it's fear that the game will break down if you don't have these hard and fast rules on what resolution must be used for. That the game will devolve into "Let's Pretend." When players and GMs trust each other, this fear goes away, and play can be solely about conflicts that are fun. Whatever those happen to be for the group in question. <br/>

Notably, all of those games above break pretty badly when their resolution systems are used to resolve discrete tasks and actions without clear stakes first.                        </div>

There's a draft version on RPGnet, and on the Forge, in the respective Design forums.  In them, social injuries are just another injury.  And again, clear stakes and narration are a requisite in those rules.                        </br></br></div>
