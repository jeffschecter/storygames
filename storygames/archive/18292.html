If the game lasts long enough, they'll grow to be cocky adventurers, then notables of the parish, maybe get secure enough to start hating on the planar refugees that show up looking for work as newcomers.  <br/><br/>Are there any big disadvantages to this approach that I'm not seeing -- the main thing I can think of is the lack of backstory that develops with time, but I'm not sure how big an absence that would be. I suppose I could specify that the characters have been in Dis for a year or so before the start of the game, so they've had time to know their way around a bit and make some friends/enemies before things start.  <br/><br/>It seems to me that one way of creating some background development in an infinite city that never stops growing is to come up with events based on what new planes have been contacted and how they're effecting the city over time.  Like:<br/>--Dis starts consuming an alternate plane which is like a miniature Carceri, inhabited by prisoners and their jailers.  What happens now that the plane is breaking down and prisoners are being freed to take revenge or flee into the city?  <br/>--The Heralds, a cult that believes that Dis is the one true God and will become Heaven when it has consumed all other planes, send missionaries to the planes that are being consumed.  One missionary recently made a remarkable conversion, of a whole warrior tribe who packed up, marched forth into Dis, and  now call themselves the Herald Crusaders.  What will they do, now they have an army?<br/>--Dis has just opened portals to an archipelago of wizards and spice plantations, a civilization so wealthy that ships from the elemental fleets are abandoning their usual routes to play pirate. <br/><br/>Is this kind of thing helpful, do you think, or should I be focusing more on the emergent story of the characters as it develops?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412358/#Comment_412358" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-20T22:51:50+00:00" title="April 20, 2013 10:51PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Write those down but then forget about them until you're stuck for something cool to have happen.<br/><br/>You know that advice for Apocalypse Engine games, cultivate a head full of imagery?

As the GM, you are responsible for the whole of the setting, which they then explore. This is pretty classic D&amp;D, and it works there because the dungeon is the most important element of play. "Backstory" is a thing you get through play--what the PCs did before the game starts doesn't have to be important at all, but all the stuff they do during the game will be remembered by the players and they will become comfortable and familiar with elements of the setting over time. This can take a while, though.<br/><br/>If you go with the AW-style of play, then the PCs are living in a place that is more or less familiar to them, and the easiest way to actually role-play familiarity is to have the players invent their characters' lives and the setting those lives take place in, while you spend your energies formulating ways to threaten those lives and that setting.<br/><br/>Going half-way, like having them be there for a little while so that they have sort-of settled into a routine is okay, too, but you have to make sure that the players have bought in to the premise and that you make sure to keep the pressure on them about how the lives of the PCs are bad and they're living on the knife edge in this ravenous city. Let them have a few nice things, and let them describe the culture(s) that their characters come from, but always ask them about what they lost, how far they have fallen, how they have had to betray their culture in order to keep it and themselves alive in the city, and stuff like that, so that the stuff they give you fits with the setting stuff that it's your responsibility to invent (which is the unfamiliar parts of Dis).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412376/#Comment_412376" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-21T09:14:40+00:00" title="April 21, 2013  9:14AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, listen to Johnstone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412378/#Comment_412378" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-21T12:46:53+00:00" title="April 21, 2013 12:46PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the feedback!
