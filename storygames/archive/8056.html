So I own this little .pdf gem and I've played it twice.  It's one of those games that gives you a lot with surprisingly little.  If you don't know the game it's a film noir genre piece about men (yup, no women pcs) trying to achieve their life goals while fighting their enemies and eluding the police for crimes they're guilty of.  All the men are connected relationships with the same woman the "femme fatale."<br/><br/>This is one of THREE games that came out of the "Ronnies" that used the Rat-Girlfriend combination.  In this game the "rat" element involves a sequence at the end of play where players decide if they're going to "rat out" any of the other players to the cops or their enemy.<br/><br/>I was very skeptical of this game when I first read it.  The card mechanic seemed like it would burn out fast, the "ratting" element felt tacked on and disconnect and there didn't seem much to hold the game together besides a lot of flavor.  Having played it twice, I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  This game is amazingly powerful and succinct.<br/><br/>So has anyone else played this game?  If you haven't, how may I convince you to try it?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177638/#Comment_177638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T17:49:46+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  5:49PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How to convince me?

The first time, with my group was only nice, a nice game for one evening, but having to find a game for a single session demo at the last PLAY convention in Modena (Italy) I did choose to try it again.  And this time I was lucky to have some players very into film noir (attracted by the presentation in the convention booklet) and the game was magical.  One player gambled all her best cards to get the femme fatal in love with her character, and at the end got shot, but happy because he died in her arms. The others fought against each other for a bit of redemption, and most got shot at the end. The one who got his dream choose to pursue it away from the Femme Fatale. At the end I had to give my used and battered partial printout of the rules to one player because she really did want to run it for her husband and friends at home...<br/><br/>What I really like about this game:<br/>- "who get what he want" is not decided by winning conflicts. You can win all the battle, at at the end you get only dead or in prison because somebody rat about you (it happened to one player in the first game: he did really win every single conflict, but lost everything at the end). To get what you want, you have to get the other player invested into it (this is what happened in the second game: the only player who wasn't ratted on did choose to leave the Femme Fatale to another character because he did like that ending)<br/>- The GM must think quickly and be able to integrate all the warious independent past of the characters (and their view of the Femme fatale) into a unified whole. I like the challenge.<br/>- You can't ever use the same stakes two times. You have to choose the right time and place, you have only one chance!<br/><br/>What I think it lack, though, is some way to provoke that kind of playing from people not already on the same page. Something like, for example, the escalation of DitV or the circle/flash rhytm of spione, something that push and provoke a certain kind of playing, of atmosphere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177667/#Comment_177667" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T07:29:50+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  7:29AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So has anyone else played this game?

Spione gives you tools to create story but the responsibility for doing so effectively falls entirely on the group.

I thought that the game might benefit from some kind of immunity mechanic or something that limited the people you could choose to rat on.  Something that would tie the ratting more tightly into the fiction.  Turned out I was wrong and people playing honestly just do that on their own with no problems.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177720/#Comment_177720" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T13:56:13+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  1:56PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>What I think it lack, though, is some way to provoke that kind of playing from people not already on the same page.

Spione gives you tools to create story but the responsibility for doing so effectively falls entirely on the group.  There are no paint-by-numbers templates to help keep the group on track.<br/><br/>Yes, but let's see it from this point of view:<br/><br/>In Spione, people have to know what to do during the maneuvers phase. Knowing all the rules and playing the rules by-the-book will keep the flashpoint phase on track, but for the maneuvers phase, you need to know what "the cold" is  and how to provoke it. And this is explained in the rest of the book. The book give you simple "you have to do this and that" explanation that, if followed, give you the desired kind of experience. But even if you don't read the book, I noticed (playing the game at some demonstrations with people who didn't read the book) that there still is a very peculiar "rhythm" in the story, with long scenic talking followed by fast and furious action and then back again to talking. So the game system give you a kind of rhythm, and if you use it in the way explained in the rest of the book, you get the experience. Both system and explanations help you in this.<br/><br/>About One Can Have Her, there is really not a lot on the game system that give you something specific. It's a DitV variant with cards with some hardwired result when you use a figure. There is something (the fact that the cards are used and lost and you literally "have to play with the cards you have been dealt" to get what you want, not on a single conflict but in the entire story. The fact that you can't use the same stakes twice, etc.) but my impression is that is a lot less specific and peculiar than Spione. There are really a lot of very diverse kind of rhythm you can get with this systems.  And the advice in the rest of the book is not on a simple basic level as in Spione: it's very much high level, it talks about the kind of story you have to get at the end, not about what you have to do to get it.  So I think it's a lot less helpful for people who don't know already how to do it (or at least this is my impression, I haven't played One Can Have Her as much as Spione)<br/>This is not so much a critic of the game, that works well with his intended audience. It's a difference in the desired audience: One Can Have Her is a game aimed to people who have no need to be explained how film noir works. Spione explain how to get a "guy vs spy" story to people (like me) who never read a single spy book in his life...<br/><br/>Talking about this made me think about how to "sell" One Can Have Her to a general audience: it would be a nice to have a DVD with movie clips as examples of the different situation of the game, taken from different classic "film noir".\n<blockquote>One Can Have Her gives you a lot of material to work with during character creation and then it's up to you to "just play" that material.</blockquote>\nYes, I did forgot the character creations. Another think I liked very much in the game and that speed up very much the set up time. Really, ideal for a convention environment. I think I will use it again next time.\n<blockquote>  The face card mechanics then periodically spike the original material to keep it fresh.  It's simple and effective but does place more creative responsibility on the group.  Spione has more editorial structure but has equally as minimal content structure.</blockquote>\nI am not sure I understand what you mean with "editorial" and "content" structure. Can you give me some examples?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177726/#Comment_177726" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T14:49:54+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  2:49PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you about Spione and it's idea of "The Cold."  It's simple to explain, really grabby and how the tools are supposed to work to that end are very clear.  And I admit One Can Have Her doesn't have such a clearly articulated focus point.<br/><br/>What I meant by "editorial" structure is that who can contribute when, how much and in what direction to the fiction is very explicit.  During Maneuvers I can add one thing to a scene and I'm not bounded by that thing being good or bad for a principle.  During Flashpoints I either contribute momentum (single cards), resolutions (double cards) or modifers (stacked cards of different rank).  That's a gross simplification but it gets the point across.  Also, I am bound by good or bad for the principle depending on whether or not I'm a principle player unless it's a modifier.<br/><br/>There's no such (explicit) structure in One Can Have Her.  <br/><br/>When I think of content structure I'm thinking of something like Dogs in the Vineyard that actually constrains what the fiction can contain.  Town Creation being the biggest example.  It's a template you follow to create a situation.  It's hard to go wrong if you stick to the town creation rules where as it's very easy to go wrong with Spione.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177755/#Comment_177755" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T01:45:08+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  1:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see now what you mean. Yes, there is very little content structure in One Can Have Her. There is much more in Spione, I think (think about the trespass, and the way you have to get rid of the supporting cast by killing of imprisoning them if you don't disclose, and if you disclose, you have to send them away to save them: it's a very strong content guide for the ending)<br/><br/>Talking about One Can Have Her made me remember another good thing about the game: the very strictly-explained conflict resolution rules. Only one challenger, no counter-stakes, only one chance, then you can't ever use that stake again. It one of the variants I have seen of Conflict Resolution rules that I thing would be more difficult to misread or use badly.<br/><br/>The only places where the book in my opinion lacks clarity is in not talking enough about what happen if people rat and the game doesn't end. I asked the author about this, and the answer was that only the last ratting phase "count", the previous ones make you a marked man and you continue playing with your secret known to the police or your enemy, but you still can get the Femme Fatale if you are not ratted on in the last round.<br/><br/>Another thing I remembered: the game got my attention because you listed it in your "play passionately" page. It was the only game in your list that I didn't know! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
