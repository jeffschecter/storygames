                    I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/03/crowdfunding-collection-95/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 95, including every tabletop project started between 01/27 and 02/03.</a></b><br/><br/>These collection seen the start of more then 60 crowdfunding projects in the span of a week, with at least 20 of them over their works in the form of a magazine. Which made the selection for the shout-out ones tough, I went for mostly those I starred.<br/>I noticed <b>Reach of Titan</b> because I consider the idea to focus on fights against colossal creatures, and the challenge to survive in a world in which those roam, quite interesting. Cat cat CAT cat CAT <b>CATS &amp; CATS</b> catcat, cat c2t caty cat (So funny I laughed hard and I backed it). Then there is <b>POWERED by the DREAMR</b>, which is a PbtA game about fighting within dreams. I like the idea, I trust the creator and thus I backed it. I didn’t back <b>The Isles</b>, though I find the idea to revive a „Play by Post“ style of rpg that uses real live mail. There are plenty games that fit within a magazine, like, DREAMR, and I consider <b>Reunification</b>, <b>DEAD HALT</b> and <b>Exodus</b> the most interesting, yet there are so many, that you should check them all..<br/>Next to this I think <b>Journey to the Year 3000</b> to do a CYOA audiobook is cool. I did actual back the <b>More Kittens</b> supplement because of… kittens and kitten cards and because Laser Kittens turned out great. I did star the magazine supplements <b>D.I.R.G.E</b> because it sounds interesting to discuss LGBTQ+ topics and I starred <b>Strings</b> because it addresses death. I do like the <b>The „Spirit Of“ Dice Range</b> and think that it might be doing good checking out <b>Jeremy Tangman’s</b> fundraiser and supporting him.<br/>There are many, many more projects, some that I just couldn’t investigate further. Just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 PbtA Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Story Game Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Magazin Role-Playing Game<br/>3 Magazine (General)<br/>3 Magazine (Supplements)<br/>4 Magazine (System-Specific)<br/>2 Magazine (D&amp;D 5E)<br/>3 Magazine (OSR, Old School)<br/>1 Game(Audio)Book<br/>2 Settings<br/>4 Supplements<br/>5 D&amp;D + PFRPG Supplements<br/>3 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>1 Magazine (Comic)<br/>1 Medizine Fundraiser<br/>2 Notebook Projects<br/>3 Map Projects<br/>5 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Webserie<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/03/crowdfunding-collection-95/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/02/03/crowdfunding-collection-95/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/10/crowdfunding-collection-96/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 96, including every tabletop project started between 02/03 and 02/10.</a></b><br/><br/>The „Zine Quest“ led to another busy week and to the start of 41 really interesting and cool crowdfunding projects.<br/>If you like Fate, you might like to have a look at <b>Titan Hunt</b>. A game in which you battle truly enormous creatures and the only rpg not in the Zine-Format. I personally backed <b>Girl Underground</b>, because it looks like fun game which provides a setting and genre inspired by Alice in Wonder Land, Wizard of Oz, Labyrinth and other novels. I am as well keeping a look on <b>Mall Kids</b> as it looks interesting and has a nostalgic topic and I got an eye on <b>Champions of the Earth</b> for its interesting description. If you like your characters small and mischievous you should take a look at <b>Goblinville</b> and <b>Kobolds Ate my Baby</b>. The latter one only has hours on its clock left. <b>Tome &amp; Wish You Were Here</b> does offer many little games and <b>Verona</b> is worth checking out if you fancy Shakespeare.<br/>To my own surprise I got enticed by the setting a <b>A Rasp of Sand</b> offers and am considering to back it. I already made my mind and backed <b>Two Apocalypse World Zines</b> by Vincent Baker – a „must back“ as I like PbtA. I did as well invest into the RPG Design Zine. Well and am pondering to back <b>Other Magic</b> and <b>Skill Points</b>. Both look super interesting and exciting, but they ain’t shipping to Germany (and I am a sucker for physical books).<br/>You find that there plenty more, very cool, super interesting projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>3 Magazine Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games (Teenage Angst)<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games (Goblins &amp; Kobolds)<br/>2 Settings<br/>2 Supplements<br/>3 Adventures<br/>3 Dice Projects<br/>2 Magazines<br/>2 Magazines (Game Design)<br/>2 Magazines (System Specific)<br/>2 Magazines (D&amp;D)<br/>1 Magazine (OSR, Old-School)<br/>3 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Notebook<br/>3 Map Projects<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/10/crowdfunding-collection-96/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/02/10/crowdfunding-collection-96/</a><br/><br/><b>Google+ Warning</b><br/>If you get the notification about a new Crowdfunding Collection via Google+ posts: That will soon be over!<br/>My Google+ Account will be deleted at April 2.<br/>If you like to have be post the Crowdfunding Collection to another place, please message me. I think the best way might be blog comments. You might reply to the post whereever I post it. Google+ reply notifications have gotten unreliable!                        </div>

                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/17/crowdfunding-collection-97/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 97, including every tabletop project started between 02/10 and 02/17.</a></b><br/><br/>This time around you’ll find no less than 57 projects, 17 of whom are fulfledge games. Thus I can only give a selected few one a shout out, which by no means shall inidcate that the rest aren’t cool, interesting projects as well.<br/>So, I personally did back <b>Casket Land</b> as well as <b>Comrades</b> among the full games. Both are PbtA games. Casket Land will have you play a one-shot in the wild west. While Comrades puts you in the shoes of the revolutionary underground. If you like to get a whole bunch of Mini-RPGs check out <b>Love Letters</b> by Meguey Baker and <b>synthesis</b>. The games by Meguey are once that have been played at her home, while those in synthesis does support the metatextual analysis the zine provides. <b>Suburb Punk</b> on the other hand is more ground and explores the (glorified) 90ties in full. I would have backed it, would they sent to Germany. If you like your nostalgia more 80ties and enjoy horror, check out <b>RPG Nasty</b>, a game offering just that. Among the „normal“ games I feel tempted to back <b>Icarus</b>. The game explore the rise and inevitable fall of societies with a dice-stacking mechanic. I do like the concept of <b>Beamswords and Bazookas</b> as well, yet the project description is a bit lacking. There are more interesting RPGs like <b>The Ultraviolet Grass</b>, <b>Storybook</b>, <b>Black Mass</b>, <b>Master of the Rogue Spire</b> and many, many more. Just as I said 17 in total.<br/><b>Conclave</b> is one of the rare Larp projects, offering rules how to set the game. I do as well enjoy the illustration of the game book <b>Blood Sword</b>. Well, and I dedicated a blog article to <b>Lunars: Fangs at the Gate</b>. While <b>Laser &amp; Liches</b> does look really cool. Last but not least I like to give a shout-out to <b>Matthew „The Gentleman Gamer“ Dawkins</b> Patreon, which I support and described in a blog article as well.<br/>There are plenty more projects to explore, just dive right into the list:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Science Fiction Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Powered by the Apocalypse Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games (90er, 80er)<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games (Mini-RPGs)<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games (Fantasy)<br/>1 Larp<br/>2 Gamebooks<br/>3 Supplements<br/>3 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>2 Settings<br/>4 Adventures<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>1 Accessoires<br/>1 YouTube Project<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>4 Magazines<br/>3 Magazines (System Specific)<br/>3 Magazines (OSR)<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>5 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Games with RPG Relevance<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Campaign<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/17/crowdfunding-collection-97/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/02/17/crowdfunding-collection-97/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/24/crowdfunding-collection-98/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 98, including every tabletop project started between 02/17 and 02/24.</b></a><br/><br/>This time you’ll find 46 projects in this list, 14 of whom are tabletop rpgs in English.<br/>I personally am very much amazed by the Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) games. <b>The Great American Novel</b> aims to offer the possibilty games to play character-centric games which result in stories along novels like <b>The Great Gatsby</b>, <b>Of Mice and Man</b>, <b>Huckleberry Finn</b>, <b>Moby Dick</b>, <b>Gone With the Wind</b> and others, which is something am looking forward to. Then there is <b>OBACHAN PANIC!</b>, which has a totally different tone. Focussing on rusty old ladies, grandmas and aunties the players will find quite some action to rock. Then one doesn’t want to be a grandma, one can kickass as a werewolve by playing <b>Bite Me!</b> Exploring the dynamics within ones pack. I think all three games are very cool, and backed them with enthusiasm, take a look. I did back the <b>Grey Cells RPG</b> as well. Mostly because of the interesting focus of the system on investigation. Plus, I found out the creator is quite very nice, sending an Discord invite and all shortly after I backed.<br/>I am tempted to back the <b>CHTHONIC CORNBELT</b> magazine, which combines Americana and Cthulhu. It has a small system of it’s own, though it mostly fits with B/X. Then there is <b>Rosenstrasse</b>, a serious minded immersive experience that aims to explore the relationship between Jewish men and non-Jewish women from 1933 till the seminal protest in 1943.<br/>Next to those, if you are either a fan of the game <b>Everyone is John the RPG</b> or <b>Soth: a game of cultists vs investigators</b> you can support their latest editions. In Everyone is John everyone plays a mental facette of John, a bit like in Being John Malkovich. Soth does appear to offer a rather humerous approach to summoning the Great Old Ones. Then there is <b>Leviathan Rising</b>, a game focussing on „Enlightenment Punk“, that takes the punk-nomer serious. Alternatively you can enjoy Prom Night as a witch in <b>Be Witching</b> or experience hairy horror stories with Glamrock hairdoes in <b>Hair Metal Horror</b>. If you like a GM-less, cooperative game check out <b>Pilgrims of Rao</b> and if you are in SciFi <b>InterStellar Mercenary</b> is worth having a look.<br/>There are many, plenty more projects that are cool, interesting and worth checking out. Just take a look for yourself:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 PbtA Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Sci-Fi Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Magazine Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Settings<br/>5 Adventures<br/>2 Accessoires<br/>3 Enamel Pins<br/>3 Magazines<br/>2 Magazines (OSR)<br/>5 Magazines (System Specific)<br/>1 RPG App<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/02/24/crowdfunding-collection-98/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/02/24/crowdfunding-collection-98/</a> </div>
