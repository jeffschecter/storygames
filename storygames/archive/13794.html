Meet us for breakfast at 8am (if you want), and then game from 9:30am to 9:30pm. Right now we have seats available for events featuring Burning Empires, a FATE/TSoY mash-up, D&amp;D 3.5, Pathfinder, D&amp;D 4e, and good ol' Star Wars Saga Edition.<br/><br/>To grab a seat, post in the thread linked above with your requests. You need an ENWorld account, but thems is free, so there you go.<br/><br/>I posted this in the conventions thread, but I want to get the word out as much as I can.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
