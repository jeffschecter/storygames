What could <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I</span> a person clone using text released under the Open Game License?  <br/><br/>Among the available sources are d20/D&amp;D and clones (including Mutant Future), Fudge, Fate, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, True20, Action! System (descended from HERO System and Fuzion), Traveller, Basic Roleplaying/RuneQuest/Call of Chtulhu (via GORE and Mongoose RuneQuest), The Fantasy Trip (via Warrior &amp; Wizard), public domain text from 4C (FASERIP), the d6 System (West End Games - Ghostbusters and Star Wars)... I'm sure I'm missing some.  <br/><br/>I guess some of the questions are how much text <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">am I</span> is our hypothetical person willing to add and how far are they willing to go to change dice mechanics.<br/><br/>If someone wanted to clone Villains and Vigilantes or Palladium's basic house system, those seem pretty straightforwardly descended from D&amp;D and thus pretty do-able.  What else?  <br/><br/>Does anyone know of a family tree of RPGs on the web anywhere?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
