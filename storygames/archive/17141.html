There's one minor stumbling block I seem to always run into right after we've chosen dice for Setup. Namely, within the context of the story you are creating, how much of the Setup information should be in the characters' past/present (at the start of the story) vs. how much is something that won't be established until within the scenes themselves. Most of the actual-play reports I read seem to do a mix of both, but is there a good rule of thumb? (For instance, is it best to have Needs to already in play at the start of your story but allow Objects and Locations to be established during the game?)<br/><br/>The other night, I played a game of the Ice, and it seems like everything we selected didn't come into play until the game itself. I was in a specialist/support work relationship, but I didn't start my job until early in Act 1 (I was the specialist). My support person was a drinking buddy of another player, and they didn't meet until the first scene. I also shared a relationship with another player of "the only survivors" and a need with this same player of "to get off watching the DVD of what we did" (or something similar); our first scene together (not a flashback) was us surviving a shipwreck and about halfway through the game, the DVD came into play. Similarly, our Location and Object didn't come into play until Act 1 and Act 2, respectively. <br/><br/>Other games I've played, the Setup has been much more set in the past -- i.e., we were survivors of something that happened a long time ago, the specialist is already the support person's boss, the drinking buddies have been friends a while, etc. It's never been 100% either way, though -- there have always been at least a few things that don't come into play until our characters encounter them for the first time during a scene.<br/><br/>For our game the other night, I was a little worried at first, but it actually turned out pretty well. We didn't "write the story" ahead of time for the most part, and it all got used more or less (the needs felt slightly more one-sided than they should have). But I kept feeling that we would have had a little more freedom if we'd assigned some of the Setup info to our characters' past (and then employed flashbacks if we really needed something fleshed out). As it was, we had a great time and a great game, but it felt very slightly off.<br/><br/>Anyone else able to relate? Any thoughts on what we might have done differently?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389045/#Comment_389045" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T11:33:59+00:00" title="September  2, 2012 11:33AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2012 11:34AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting...without ever talking about it, I always started with Needs pre-existing (partly because I always urge everyone to start with a scene about the Need) but locations/objects only gaining their importance over the course of the game.<br/><br/>I absolutely think Needs need to be felt almost immediately, if not in that very first scene.

Sometimes you totally know that you have to have a scene, even if it has nothing to do with your character's needs. Sometimes there's an object that just never comes up, but the story is still awesome. Sometimes, in those most perfect of moments, you have no idea what to do with a thing, but then it hits you in the middle of a scene. It sounds obvious, but from your description it sounds like your worrying to much about crafting your story in the context of the setup, and maybe not letting the setup inspire in the moment decisions.<br/><br/>There's a blog post on anyway where Vincent talks about concentric game design in Apocalypse World, and I think that also applies to Fiasco. The core of Fiasco is something like "Each die is a scene where one character is in the spotlight, that character's player can establish or resolve, white is good and black is bad". You can totally play a game with that. Fiasco builds another layer around that, adding setup, tilt, and aftermath. They make Fiasco a much more exciting game, but aren't completely necessary, and easily altered. That was more relevant sounding in my head, but you get the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389055/#Comment_389055" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T16:04:21+00:00" title="September  2, 2012  4:04PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one reason I'm so insistent on the Need for the first scene is because I play with a lot of inexperienced Fiasco noobs, and the wide openness of "well, do anything" in the first scene is too much to take.  They can do "what's the next, natural scene" a lot easier once the game gets moving.  I think if we generated a Need that was as specific as getting out of the handcuffs I would have insisted on generating a second Need too (a big broad general Need is usually enough to keep a group going by itself, specific, focused Needs normally need 2.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389063/#Comment_389063" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T19:50:48+00:00" title="September  2, 2012  7:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2012 7:51PM by jda1974.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with JD that Needs seem to be geared towards being in effect from before Act 1, Scene 1, even if that's not how my group played last time. But Esoteric makes a good point that some Needs make more sense if brought about through gameplay. <br/><br/>Personally, I think it would be hysterical to have a game where two characters are handcuffed together right from the start. But it might hamper replayability. Game 1 with like that would be great. Game 2 like that would be repetitive. Game 3 like that would not happen.<br/><br/>What about Relationships? Some of them, like most family relationships, seem pretty clear that they should be in effect before Act 1, Scene 1. But others, like work, crime and romance, might be able to come into play during the game. (But <i>should</i> they? I guess that's the question.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/samwise" title="samwise"><img alt="samwise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/samwise">samwise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389078/#Comment_389078" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T00:45:49+00:00" title="September  3, 2012 12:45AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would generalize: <b>all setup need to be established and in effect prior Act.1 Scene 1</b>, only question is how detail it should be.<br/>Setup is a way to make pseudo-random starting positions and not to make goal limitation of any scene.<br/>When you have unestablished Need's etc., you will railroad your scenes to establish them or fail to do it.<br/>Last but not least, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by wasting you Act.1 scenes to establish yet unestablished relationships or needs, you will protract Act.1 into Act.2 and will need to end abruptly.</span><br/><br/>Esoteric says "The most obvious counter example I can come up with is that "Need... to get out of these handcuffs" is a bit odd to start out with right off the bat, but works great if you lead up to it through act 1."<br/><br/>I disagree here, it don't feel odd.

It sounds like we are at opposing sides of spectrum with Esoteric, but probably we isn't. I just observe that Esoterics offered "big rule" can lead to ignoring setup and stake it highly on players. If you like to cite Vincent Baker I can spring one too, in podcast about "Dogs in the Vineyard" he talks about rules of constructing cities and that game can fall flat if city wasn't "good enough". In "Fiasco" it isn't so strict, but you are advocating to tear down established ways that made it work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389115/#Comment_389115" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T13:29:48+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  1:29PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anything you don't define during the Setup functions for Act One like the Tilt does for Act Two.

I think a number of factors made the last play a bit wonky, not the least of which was that our two Needs were, in hindsight, probably placed between the wrong two sets of people. (We had Ecological Extremists as a Relationship and To Get Even with Every Last One of These MFers as a Need. There's no requirement that the same characters must share those two elements, but in our case, it would have been smoother.)<br/><br/>I do think I will recommend people try to have the Needs already in play at game start or, if not that, then ASAP in Act 1. Ditto Relationships, though I think these are not quite as critical as Needs in some cases.
