What a great approach to writing, teaching, and doing layout for roleplaying games!  No idea when it'll be released, but I really think one of the main reasons John's recent games have gotten so much attention is how accessible the documents are and how easy it is to turn the text into play. I'm excited and hopeful that we'll see a new focus on the transmission and teaching of games emerge in this community, because, in general, I don't think that's something we've historically been that good at.<br/><br/>Also, Game Chef 2009 is moving along apace and some great games have already been submitted.  Additionally, I think the conversations surrounding changes to Game Chef and where the tradition is going (or what it is in the first place) are also going really well, despite being difficult and thorny. There seems to be a lack of blame and more of a dedication to serious, personal discussion, which I really appreciate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley" title="MickBradley"><img alt="MickBradley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.canonpuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/mick-blackhat1001.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley">MickBradley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231666/#Comment_231666" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T09:58:38+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:58AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Lady Blackbird</i> has swept in and saved my group's evening twice now as a fill-in game.

I decided to do these pictures as a present. I put the spoiler for Ben there because he didn't want to know my inspirations, etc.<br/><br/>All of the pictures are inspired by the poem "The Waste Land," by T.S. Eliot. My initial thought was, "Man, Ben's going to know a couple people I get to model, I'm sure. That'll be weird." But as I fleshed out the concept more, I decided that I wanted to use people Ben knew <i>exclusively.</i> Coincidentally, they are all romantically involved with indie game designers (and two of them have designed games, as well). The models are Meg Baker, Joshua AC Newman's wife Carrie,  and myself. There's a final image that I need Ben to model for, but I won't be able to take it until I get a chance to visit all of my lovely friends in Seattle.<br/><br/>Carrie's picture:\n<blockquote>Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\t <br/>Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\t <br/>Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\t <br/>Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,<br/>Looking into the heart of light, the silence.</blockquote>\nMeg's picture:\n<blockquote>Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,\t <br/>Had a bad cold, nevertheless\t <br/>Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<br/>With a wicked pack of cards. </blockquote>\nAnd mine, which should be sort of obvious:\n<blockquote>Fear death by water.</blockquote>\n<br/>I'm pretty jazzed that he picked up on the themes of the images without knowing their literal interpretation. The final picture is going to be of Ben, scattering ashes, for the quintessential "I will show you fear in a handful of dust." I wasn't going for a direct and literal translation of the <i>meaning</i> of the poem into photography, but just trying to pick up some of the vivid imagery present there and twist it into some kind of weird, modern creepiness that immediately evoked something that blurs the lines between fantasy and reality in that way that Ben really likes. You can ask him about the game itself in another thread, because I'm not sure what he's ready to share, but the flavor and definitely the structure and form factor are really exciting to me. It's funny that I did the photos as a present and now I can't wait to get my hands on the game itself.<br/><br/>Edited to add: Carrie and Meg are the best models. With Carrie, I asked her to hop in the shower while wearing a fancy dress so she could be soaking wet, and then she trudged through her neighborhood like a champ, holding a pile of snapdragons bigger than she was and looking forlorn. Meg was willing to put on eleventy-billion layers of belly-dancing clothes and pose under monolights in an already hot attic, since I'd forgotten the cord for my strobes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231954/#Comment_231954" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T21:59:47+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:59PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I avoided the paxpox by judicious use of handwashing and sanizer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231957/#Comment_231957" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T22:08:10+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 10:08PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MickBradley</cite><i>Lady Blackbird</i>has swept in and saved my group's evening twice now as a fill-in game.

I saw John Harper on Facebook and chatted at him in a very fanboyish way after that game.  I couldn't help myself.
