If you agree with it, please sign the petition here: <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/</a><br/><br/>Even better, please share this with your friends so more people can let WotC know that it's time for a change.<br/>Cheers<br/><br/>R<br/><br/>--<br/><br/><b>Summary</b><br/><br/>Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) is the single most famous roleplaying game in the world, the route most people got into the hobby, and the flagship of the hobby. So it's a tragedy that the game is pushing away potential fans through artwork and even game text that is overwhelmingly focused on one customer: the white male. This petition calls on Wizards of the Coast to improve this for the next edition of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>We want to see artwork that reflects the diversity of the real world<br/><br/>As a minimum, 50% of people depicted should be female<br/><br/>As a minimum 20% should be non-white (in line with the population of the USA)<br/><br/>Such characters should be portrayed as no more submissive or weak on average than white male characters<br/><br/>WotC should lose the text that describes demihuman races as exclusively pale-skinned.<br/><br/>Please sign this petition if you agree.<br/><br/><b>More detail for the curious cat</b><br/><br/>60% of images in D&amp;D 4th edition (specifically the DMG, PHB, PHB2 and Adventurer's Vault) were of men[1]. On a range of measures designed to pick up on sexist depictions (active vs neutral stance, whether the character was fully dressed and whether the image was sexually suggestive) D&amp;D scored badly, with well over a third of images hitting any given measure of sexism[1].<br/><br/>There was only one image of a non-white human character in the D&amp;D 4th edition core books[2], and across the core books of all four numbered editions of D&amp;D only two non-white human characters depicted [2,3]. Even the nonhuman races seem to be dominated by paler skin tones; looking at the playlet material for D&amp;D Next, the nonhuman races available to play were stipulated as having skin tones consistent with a white human, with the possible exception of dwarves who are permitted to be "light brown"[4].<br/><br/>It's only a fantasy. But it's our fantasy and we can make it whatever we want. Everyone should be able to open a D&amp;D book and not feel excluded. Wizards of the Coast are very likely saying behind closed doors "white male heroes is what our fanbase wants". Well, then it's up to us, as the fanbase, to tell them they're wrong about that.<br/><br/>D&amp;D Next is in development right now. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape the game. Most of the buzz has concentrated on mechanics. But there's no reason why the game can't take leaps forward on diversity as well.<br/><br/><b>What we are asking for</b><br/><br/>We the undersigned call upon Wizards of the Coast to make D&amp;D Next at least as diverse as the real world. We want to see men and women of all colours in the artwork. And we want the fantasy races to reflect the full palette of human experience, too. Even though some of us are white men, we aren't going to be put off our hobby by images of people that aren't - in fact, just the opposite.<br/><br/>The USA represents the biggest market for D&amp;D at the time of writing. As such, this petition proposes a minimum standard that reflects the demographics of the US. 50% of images containing a humanoid creature should be female, and where applicable 20% should be non-white. It is also important that these images should avoid displaying these characters as submissive or weak, or at least no more so than white males. Finally, text describing demihumans should be rewritten to make them as diverse as the people who play the game - not restricted to white skin-tones.<br/><br/>[1] From Anna Kreider's article here: <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=3501" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=3501</a><br/><br/>[2] Robert Sullivan's video here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com</a> /watch?v=utsvMDewdUA&amp;feature=plcp (NB I have deliberately put a space in this link to stop story games from embedding the video in my post - just remove the space and the link will work)<br/><br/>[3] Chris Van Dyke's article here: <a href="http://raceindnd.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/nerd-nite-presentation-november-18th-2008/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://raceindnd.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/nerd-nite-presentation-november-18th-2008/</a><br/><br/>[4] Chris Stone-Bush's article here: <a href="http://www.doucheydm.com/?p=1043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.doucheydm.com/?p=1043</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388018/#Comment_388018" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T05:39:33+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  5:39AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we are to pretend D&amp;D is a European medieval fantasy game, the majority of people in the game will be pale to lightly tan and won't be female if adventuring.

There are subtler, less obvious (to the non-historian) inaccuracies which are just as fundamental to D&amp;D game-play.<br/><i>For example</i>, most D&amp;D games (across various editions of the basic rules, published modules and campaigns I've personally played in) assume a boomtown market economy which is, as far as I can tell, more closely related to the American Wild West than to any period of European history \u2014 when it's not portrayed in full contemporary style, even! I'm not even talking the commerce of magic items, here: just basic supplies and equipment. D&amp;D adventurers come to town with old coins, precious gemstones and valuable antiques they retrieved from hidden treasure-hoards and they go shopping like they were in a mall: DMs and module-writers assume (and describe) an assortment of shops which keep in their inventory whatever item the rulebook lists as commonly available; they pay a fixed price in cash and carry away their new equipment. A few DMs will have them visit a money-changer before they go shopping or have them haggle the price rather than just go strictly with the listed one, but that's it.<br/>If the game was set in <i>medieval</i> Europe, then towns and villages would have no shops at all - only the largest cities would! European peasants  of the Middle-Ages lived in self-sufficient farmsteads and hamlets, with little division of labor; the few items which weren't home-produced were procured from itinerant peddlers met at periodic markets (comparable to country fairs). Specialized craftsmen lived in towns, but even in the largest cities of Europe, where "shops" were found, no D&amp;D adventurer would be have been able to buy a dagger from the shelf paying in cash\u2026 because "shops" were actually workshops and did not, as a general rule, keep finished items in their inventory (a potter, maybe, kept a few basic items, but not a weaponsmith)! Artisans worked on order, and all items were custom made.<br/>D&amp;D games would look very different if acquiring even basic, nonmagical weapons and armor required a journey to a distant, large city, where adventurers take residence (another non-trivial thing! the few traveler's inns weren't like modern motels) for as long a time as needed by the artisans to manufacture the specialized items they demand.<br/><br/>EDIT: because in hindsight this looks off-topic. My point was: "historical accuracy" is never a valid excuse, because D&amp;D has exactly 0 historical accuracy, be it by incident or by design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonB" title="JonB"><img alt="JonB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonB">JonB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388032/#Comment_388032" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T07:00:18+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  7:00AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2012 7:01AM by JonB.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sign'd.

More importantly, they want your feedback! With D&amp;D Next they want to know what you want. So I think if you want change, be loud! Now is the time to speak. They are inviting you to.<br/><br/>D&amp;D isn't a European medieval fantasy simulation. That's one of its inspirations but not the only one. D&amp;D also has ninjas. Plus my anthropologist and historian professor friends are fond of pointing out that many simulations often repeat misunderstandings. For example, according to them, there are a lot more extraordinary women in European medieval history than many realize. Depicting extraordinary women in a European medieval simulation shouldn't be a big deal... let alone in D&amp;D... where there are beholders and mindflayers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388041/#Comment_388041" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T07:17:22+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  7:17AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2012 7:19AM by Teataine.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I endorse this message. <br/><br/>But I am also slightly disturbed by this bit: <br/><i>"As a minimum 20% should be non-white (in line with the population of the USA)"</i><br/><br/>If we're being inclusive and all, why is the USA the model?

When telling people like me to not be respected, please take off the rose-colored glasses and treat everyone equally or else you miss the entire point of your crusade.<br/><br/>Historically accurate to the actual world and historically accurate to the stories are two different things.

So D&amp;D is meant to have nonwhite people in it. In any case, the vanilla D&amp;D background is pretty vague, and from the monster list you could deduce that there are non-European themes (rakshasa, mummy, etc). So the petition isn't asking D&amp;D to go against its background at all - rather, it is asking D&amp;D to live up to what it says in the text.<br/><br/>Q Why are you including quotas, isn't that rather superficial? And why US figures?<br/><br/>A I started out with a vague "please make D&amp;D art more diverse" plea, but it needed something specific for WotC to aim for. The petition does say "as a minimum" because I don't regard these numbers as a particularly high bar. The wording of the petition makes it clear that I'm not just saying "do this by the numbers" but rather do it respectfully. And, having decided to ask for specific numbers I went for US figures because that's where most of the audience is (I myself live in the UK). Neither decision was easy.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way someone suggested the numbers were just for black people. Not so, they're for any nonwhite people. (Apologies for the term nonwhite, by the way - it just seems to be the least offensive term I can pick without listing all ethnicities evar.) Again, this is a very low bar. Yes, there is room for interpretation here, is Osama Bin Laden white or whatever - but it would be hard to do worse than they're doing right now.<br/><br/>Q Can I have a chainmail bikini clause please?<br/><br/>A The short answer is probably yes. I need to think about how to write it in, but even before you wrote this I was thinking that I'd missed an important point. So check back in 24 hours, there will likely be one added. (I will make it clear to the viewer that it has been edited, in case anyone is concerned about people signing the earlier version not being able to tell it has changed.)<br/><br/>Q You say whites aren't put off by nonwhite images, why are you assuming the reverse isn't true?<br/><br/>A Mainly because I read at least one article from a dude who said he felt alienated by the white-only art. There's been one comment on this thread saying the same. But the truth is that the statement about "we won't be put off" was not intended to be a statement of fact per se, but a statement of intent by the signatories of the petition. In fact everything in the petition is only what the signatories are saying, in effect.<br/><br/>Q Why a petition, not a polite letter?<br/><br/>A If you read the article (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.a...dreye/20120502" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.a...dreye/20120502</a>) by the lead D&amp;D art guy, you'll see that he's heard these arguments before and dismissed them on grounds of commercial considerations. In other words, our fans want semi nude chicks so that is what we shall give them (he didn't actually address race in the article). Well, I figure a petition is just a polite letter signed by lots of fans. It's the most efficient way to argue against him - show that he actually has commercial reasons to fix this problem.<br/><br/>Q You shouldn't try to force your views on others. Let WotC write the game they want to write.<br/><br/>A I agree! This petition isn't legally binding, and nobody is compelled to sign it. Though of course, I would argue that you should sign it.<br/><br/>WotC is a commercial operation. I believe that if enough people tell them they want something, they'll give that thing to them. But they don't have to - if artistic integrity comes into play (i.e. they strongly feel that D&amp;D should only have white people and lightly clad women in the art) then perhaps they will ignore the petition.

Because it's just a petition, after all: not a boycott, not a court order, not a mob throwing rocks and building big bonfires to throw books on. For fuck's sake, WotC <i>specifically asked people to tell them what they want</i>, presumably so that they can act on it. Though I suppose we could all be wrong about that...maybe they just want to hear what everyone wants out of D&amp;D so that they can laugh cruelly and whisper, "No."<br/><br/>Anyway, all of this...thing that you're doing seems like a serious overreaction. D&amp;D is sui generis at this point, it owes more to itself than it does to the early stories you think it's about. More to the point, I honestly don't know why you seem to feel so threatened by the idea of people asking for more varied, more inclusive art: it's one of those wonderful situations where <i>no one loses</i>. (Except people who want things to be exactly like they were in the earlier parts of the 20th century, I guess, but that market is dead. WotC needs to sell books to people who live in the 21st century, and better art can help with that.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388166/#Comment_388166" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T02:40:17+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  2:40AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2012 2:40AM by Johnstone.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This Thread, A Play in One Act.<br/><br/>OP: Hey, somebody!

From time to time I find people from South America that try to make me feel guilty because some Spaniards went there and some of them did very ugly stuff.

I'm not really clear on what the difference between SOCIAL PRESSURE and vocal disagreement is? Isn't vocally disagreeing with someone a way of exerting social pressure on someone? Encouraging others to ignore somebody with a history of stupid comments about things like this -<i> in hopes of avoiding further derailment of an important discussion</i> (which obviously didn't work) - is not a particularly controversial thing to do. There is a fundamental difference between socially condemning reprehensible speech acts and actual censorship (if you don't believe me read Judith Butler's<i> Excitable Speech</i>).<br/><br/><br/>In the interest of, again, avoiding further derailment of the discussion: the illustrations in D&amp;D are all kinds of racist and sexist, but they don't have to be, since there's nothing in the game itself that makes that necessary.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388195/#Comment_388195" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T09:18:13+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  9:18AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2012 9:21AM by whduryea.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Um, obviously?

The boycott of South African goods was about ending Apartheid, not about getting the South African government to stop saying racist stuff. Boycotts of companies that refuse to allow their employees to unionize, exploit workers in underdeveloped countries, discriminate in their hiring policies, abuse animals as part of their manufacturing process, and indiscriminately contaminate the natural world are all instances of applying economic pressure to address a concrete, material problem. They're not about telling anyone not to speak.<br/><br/>The "this offends me, shut up" boycott was birthed by the right and has its roots in obscenity trials and blacklists and, more recently,  shit like evangelicals boycotting Disney because they perceived as being too gay friendly. The left has inexplicably adopted it lately, but more often than not it backfires spectacularly (see: Chik-fil-A).<br/>\n<blockquote>This is why we denounce Westboro Baptist Church or Todd Akin. </blockquote>\nDenouncing is something very different from actively trying to silence someone. It's perfectly reasonable to say, "Fuck Westboro and here are all of the reasons why," but it's something very different to apply pressure to try to deprive them of their right and/or capacity to protest. \n<blockquote>I am all about free speech, but free speech includes the right to say, "Hey, just so you know, you should ignore that guy, because he's a blithering racist."</blockquote>\nSure it does.

I'm white and male, but I can envision being a black, hispanic, asian, native american etc. man or woman and being disappointed and feeling alienated by the VERY strong lack of art depicting people like me in power fantasies like D&amp;D. There is a big psychological factor involved in seeing people who look similar to you depicted positively and in positions of power or respect. Certainly, the inverse of that could be true as well, in that the less you see people like yourself, the less you expect to. And then, at least on some subconscious level, the less you expect it to be possible or feasible that people like that "should" be. <br/><br/>This is all easy to speculate about from my position of privilege, but isn't it the responsibility of those with privilege to demand the fair treatment of those without it? If people can't get together on something as simple as seeing a few african or asian faces in art, women in sensible armor, or brown elves in their fantasy RPG, what does that really say about what we fantasize? <br/><br/>Are we all really so immature and narrow-minded that all we really want is white guys with huge cocks and muscles, and scantily clad white women with big tits? Dude, why? Just go buy a copy of Barbaren (which you should anyway, it's HILARIOUS!) and let the rest of us enjoy a D&amp;D which is the way it should be; one where <i>everyone</i> gets to enjoy their fantasy, and we don't all have to share one version?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388211/#Comment_388211" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T11:47:53+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 11:47AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>let the rest of us enjoy a D&amp;D which is the way it should be; one where <i>everyone</i> gets to enjoy their fantasy, and we don't all have to share one version?</blockquote>\nOut of rhetorical curiousity, is this somebody's priority in the field of D&amp;D debate? I mean, theoretically speaking, am I entitled to have D&amp;D cater to what I find enjoyable in fantasy merely because I have such preferences? Has the publisher said that this sort of universal satisfaction is on the agenda, or are there pundits out there who think that it should be?<br/><br/>(My preferences don't have anything to do with racial issues, which is why I'm asking. It would certainly be wicked interesting intellectually speaking if the cornerstone principle behind the demand for multiculturalism in D&amp;D actually were this sort of universal franchise - fantasy roleplaying to all tastes! I've no idea how such an ideal could be fulfilled, though, as we're just speaking about a single game and not all fantasy games ever.)<br/><br/>Also, just to clarify, I'm not trying some backhanded way to say that demanding cultural inclusiveness is without basis. Surely cultural inclusiveness could still be a justified priority even if it's established that D&amp;D does not actually have a duty to present everybody's favourite fantasies simultaneously.

Could their promises have been misunderstood somehow here?<br/><br/>For some reason it just seems hilarious to me if they're seriously committed to universal satisfaction like this. Not just an effort to make everybody happy (difficult in itself) as a matter of good business practice, but actual obligation to satisfy everybody's deep-rooted fantasies, all to make D&amp;D worthy of the name.

On the other, I can't really see it doing anything worst than raising some bitterness through controversy, so it might be worth a try.<br/><br/>Personally I'd just get rid of illustrations but my friends say I'm an extremist.<br/><br/>The "WotC should lose the text that describes demi-human races as exclusively pale-skinned" bit makes me weary though. Wanting illustrations to show more diversity can only be good. Wanting to police the content of the game - which is what this seems to border to me -  is more problematic I find. Where do we draw the line ? What about artistic license ? What if it makes sense in context (Should there be more illustrations of colored people in L5R ? If L5R's all pseudo Asian setting is acceptable, <i>when</i> does an all "white" setting becomes acceptable ?) ? How far do creators have to justify their creations then ? Does every setting need to be Tekumel* ?<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is that, raising those questions of the representations of characters in RPGs can't but  raise the problem of world building, and settings, and intents - both the creators' and the players'.<br/><br/>Someone mentioned the ill-conceived Forgotten Realms**, for which I hold little love - and the two things that came to my mind were: they're going to have to re-write quite a few things if they want that new population census of illustrations to makes sense in the setting and "Poor Ed Greenwood". I mean, I don't like what he created, but it's his baby, and I guess he's going to have to change it quite a bit or see it abandoned on the wayside if things go that way.<br/><br/>The way I see it, WotC should get rid of any pretension to make any modicum of sense altogether from an ethnological perspective for the main setting(s) of D&amp;D Next. If anything, the  modern video-game character creation model should be the one generally used as reference. Anything goes, everything works, and no one cares (If you tried, say, making a - somewhat, the tools aren't great -black nobleman character introduction for Dragon Age: Origins, you'll know exactly what I mean).<br/><br/>Which is what Exalted did I guess.<br/><br/>Because, for the most part, I don't see the majority of the D&amp;D audience wanting anything more than that. The gaming equivalent of those TV shows which are supposed to be exotic but are nothing but a direct, validating, spiced up rehashing of the mundane experience of their target audience***. I don't think they generally want to deal with social issues <i>in game</i>, which I think cant not be raised if you try to take those very legitimate representation issues to their logical conclusions.<br/><br/>*: Oh dear, M. A. R. Barker is dead.

Bigotry is literally baked into that setting, which both explains the reasoning behind only having one type of human (and no demi-human PCs, other than Nezumi, whom no one but a Crab would be seen with anyway) and actually has the people of the setting acknowledge their lack of diversity.<br/><br/>That having been said, no one is advocating that they have to change any settings, only that the core game, if they actually do want to include as wide an audience as possible, should include art that represents the diversity of the gamers playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388261/#Comment_388261" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T22:50:58+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 10:50PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My bad yes, just realized, I had read that petition as targeting the D&amp;D product line as a whole - not just the core books.<br/><br/>Again, sorry for making you lose your time over this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388262/#Comment_388262" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T22:56:19+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 10:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you know...

It's only because you do not experience real physical violence and oppression as part of your everyday experience (like blacks and women and gays and poor and others do) that you could confuse this for violence and oppression.<br/><br/>Moreover, I think a liberal politics of demand is complete bullshit but really, really, (really), in this case, I cannot see any harm coming from trying, pathetically and conservatively, to maybe, just a little, try a little to not do that thing that is wrong, for all the above mentioned reasons. <br/><br/>(Petitions ask nicely for oppressors to stop oppressing you.

I think, ultimately, we should abandon Hasbro and D&amp;D, and instead take up game production for ourselves. Sage and Adam probably have learned and will learn important lessons on this front. They have shown just that they can make a better game with less. I suspect that they could have also made a more just game, had that been a priority.)<br/><br/>I don't understand the hand-wringing. At all. All of it comes across as apologies for exclusionary racism and bad boring cliched art. If anything, the petition should be criticized for not going far enough. Zak S, as much of an utter shithead as he can be sometimes (and, hey, I can be an utter shithead sometimes too. We all can.), is absolutely correct when he says, yes, our art and our characters should be sexy and powerful but they don't need to be oppressively normative. They can be short, fat, crippled, traumatized, skinny, gay, black, trans, old, whatever subaltern category you can think of and that can be sexy, powerful and beautiful. That's the potency of art. It can affirm our struggles and experience in life. <br/><br/>And no, oppressive speech should not be tolerated. We protect our community by excluding those who wish to do violence to it. <br/><br/>Also, not that I'm a big fan of Judy or Wendy, but please consult the works of Judith Butler or Wendy Brown on these matters. Felan's reference is a good place to start. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additionally</span><br/><i>Butler:</i><br/>Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence<br/>Giving An Account of Oneself<br/>Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable?<br/><i>Brown:</i><br/>States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity<br/>Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388302/#Comment_388302" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T09:57:57+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  9:57AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, and hey!

When someone comes along and basically says that they're cool with nazis but not inclusion, then re-affirming that they are not using hyperbole or playing devil's advocate, there's no real way to address that respectfully. <br/><br/>At all. <br/><br/>On this point, all of the admin are in agreement.<br/><br/>The proper response to the original comment should have been an immediate banning. Instead, it shocked me into basically a defense mechanism: Ostracism. I had no way to deal with that level of insanity at the time, and for that I apologize. I figured that it was a one-time illness that we wouldn't ever see again. I was incorrect on that assumption, and thus this thread.<br/><br/>There would have been no name-calling or group ostracism like here in this thread, if I had just gone back and issued a banning.<br/><br/>At the time, I thought "The moment has passed, I fucked up by resorting to name calling, it's too late to take administrative action now". That was another mistake. Had I done that, it would have spared us all this nonsense leading to more folks (including myself) name-calling again.<br/><br/>Again, apologies for not acting earlier. I'll revise the rules of this site to clearly state "siding with nazis is a bannable offense." <br/><br/>But honestly, until recently I never thought I'd ever, EVER have to explicitly state that as a rule. Then again, no one throwing a house party would expect to have to greet their guests with "Oh, hey, thanks for the potato salad, everyone's out back. Oh, and while you're here, just wanted to mention: Please don't take a shit on the living room floor in front of everyone, okay?

Most of us actually helping to create the cover art, either by conceiving it or actually creating it, hated that kind of outlook, but the powers that be believed that our audience was entirely white males and they needed someone that they could identify with on the cover. This was absurd for two reasons:<br/><br/>1. You're talking about a game where you pretend to be elves, halflings, or other things that are different from you, is it so hard to believe that the people who engage in this hobby might be able to see beyond themselves?<br/><br/>2. It's not only incorrect to assume that the audience is all white males, but it just makes the issue worse when the artwork only fixates on white males. It's a self-fulfilling prophesy, in other words.<br/><br/>So, when D&amp;D was bought by WotC and we started working on 3E, we really felt that this was a time when we could break this mold. We worked with the artists to create iconic characters of different ethnicities (both in appearance and in name) and with equal representation of male and female. At some point in the process, someone said, "hey, you don't have a male human fighter in the mix." We replied, "exactly." The reasons were again, twofold:<br/><br/>1. In order to be true to the system, we wanted the iconic fighter to a dwarf, because dwarves are the race that favors the fighter class.<br/><br/>2. It was a thumb to the nose of the old TSR requirement. Because, sadly, the people who noted that there was no "male human fighter" were basically saying "white human male fighter." It was our intention that while humans would be multi-ethnic, nonhumans were just that. So Tordek wasn't a white dwarf or a black dwarf, he was just a dwarf. So the core fighter wasn't a white guy. At least that was our intention.<br/><br/>Then, I went to Clarion (a six week writer's workshop)...and so the game was in the hands of others (editors, marketing people, etc.), so it didn't seem to matter that I would be gone. But when I came back, there was suddenly this... guy. A big, burly human fighter.<br/><br/>Regdar intruded his way into 3E, empowered by marketing and sales people. At the last minute, in a matter of just those few short weeks, the old TSR standard reared its ugly head. Not only was Regdar on the scene, he was in the spotlight. This was the character that would be on the cardboard standees and other promotional items, and would usually take center stage in the covers. I was caught entirely off-guard and was far too late to even comment on him. Now, to his credit, the initial Regdar artist, Todd Lockwood, made Regdar's ethnicity kind of vague. (Regdar had shown up in Todd's earlier sketches when he designed the look of 3E armor.) It's only in later artwork that Regdar seems to be pretty clearly the white male fighter we tried to avoid. And to the credit of a number of people--artists, art directors, designers and editors alike--our disdain for Regdar made its way into a lot of art. If you look closely, Regdar is getting thrashed on most of the early pieces he shows up in. (Look for his ignominious fate on the original DM's Screen, for example.)<br/><br/>Once Sue and I started Malhavoc Press, we tried very hard to have a diversity in both ethnicity and gender in our art. We already knew that unless you specified non-white, non-male, that's what you would get from most artists. In other words, if I asked for a drawing of a warrior, I'd get a white guy unless I specifically asked for something else. And I'm not trying to be harsh toward any artists--it's just the stereotypes of the genre that we need to loosen..... </blockquote>\nFar from inclusive art crushing creativity, it's the marketeer's demand for white dudes that is doing this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388369/#Comment_388369" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T01:30:54+00:00" title="August 27, 2012  1:30AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what's up with Monte Cook's new game, then?

But Wizards has said explicitly that this new D&amp;D isn't about the people working on it.

I live in an extremely multicultural city, but when I put pen to paper without thinking about it I get lily white ethnic homogeneity.  I'm now at the point where I remember to plan the ethnic and gender mix of characters.  I'm not sure whether it will ever be automatic.<br/><br/>I suppose it's partly my background (when I went back to my much smaller home town to see my mother &amp; sister singing in a choir, it took me about twenty minutes to realize that the reason the choir looked weird was that everybody was white).  Now that I ponder, I bet I'm unwittingly reinforcing that by the fact that I start off drawing most characters using an Andrew Loomis human proportions diagram (from 1943!), and the dude looks like a Ken doll.<br/><br/>I'm doing a color cover now for a game set in ancient India.  There was an explicit moment in the process were I realized that - huh - everybody was going to be Indian.  It wasn't until I'd scribbled down the rough arrangement of characters that it occurred me that there were no women.  Headsmack.

And signatures are still coming in at a rate of around 50 a day.<br/><br/>I'm optimistic that we'll reach the 1000 mark, maybe sooner than you think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388863/#Comment_388863" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T16:23:39+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  4:23PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2012 4:23PM by UserClone.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shared on Facebook.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388914/#Comment_388914" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T06:42:39+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  6:42AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could share it, but I haven't, solely because of the title.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388919/#Comment_388919" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T07:55:07+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  7:55AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've lost count of the number of people who have said "I would sign/share it BUT". You can't please everyone, and no doubt any formulation would have offended some people, perhaps as many as it pleased.<br/><br/>Obviously it's up to you whether you sign it, share it etc. My argument is: Wizards of the Coast will not notice the minutiae of this petition. They will not dwell on particular words or phrases. They will get the overall message, though. The overall message is more important than individual bits of it. <br/><br/>If you agree with the petition but hate the title, why not share with a rider that says "I hate the title of this petition, but I agree with what's in it and think you should sign it"? Indeed, FWIW when you sign it you can put in a comment, so there's nothing to stop you from saying "I hate the title" there as well.<br/><br/>It's not possible to tailor the petition so that it says what each individual signatory would wish it to say.

I'll sign the thing too.<br/><br/>What I can see as a problem is that corebook D&amp;D takes place in a world without geography or cultures. Everything is set either underground or in some vague high fantasy forest place that looks like Lord of the Rings New Zealand or something. Getting a little more specific there could help. So that the world does not only become a place with super mixed ethnicity but only a single culture. Style guides like they are used for Magic: The Gathering (whose art has it's own problems of course) could be given out to artists that way easier and even if they would default to white males usually an order for art could read: "A hero group from [one place] are in the streets of [other place]" and the artists would know that the people in one place were dressing in a specific way and had that and that skin tone. I think getting a little specific instead of generic might help. It would not make the darker-skinned character into a permanent minority, instead there will be places where they are the norm and others were there are fewer of them and a multicultural place in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SarahDarkmagic" title="SarahDarkmagic"><img alt="SarahDarkmagic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SarahDarkmagic">SarahDarkmagic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389056/#Comment_389056" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T16:04:46+00:00" title="September  2, 2012  4:04PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2012 5:59PM by SarahDarkmagic.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I attended Gen Con.

My sense that I could have a D&amp;D character who looked like me is pretty damn solid at this point, and I have far more visual references available for my white-guy characters than I could ever use. <br/><br/>So basically, if they put the same old art of white dudes with swords in 5e, it definitely won't make me more likely to buy it...and if they put in art reflecting a wider array of human beings, it won't make me less likely to buy it.

Putting some guy in a thongback fur diaper or whatever male barbarians are wearing in that genre of fantasy art might provide context. Any way the useless and skimpy armor is a mainstay of fantasy art and in a way part of the mythical "D&amp;D feel" they are trying to capture. However terrible it is as an image of woman, I would say that it is important for a portion of the fan base. A bigger portion than we might hope too, who just expect some pictures of "babes" in a D&amp;D book. I guess looking back at what defined the game over such a long time inappropriate things show up as well.<br/>The best they can do with that image, if they want all the bases to be happy, would be referencing it somehow.
