It's only a short one, you'll probably write less than 500 words in total, and I'm offering some prizes too! Since I'll be using a poll to pick the winners, I'm using RPG Net as a host but I'll happily accept entrants from any RPG site so feel free to tap in here if you're interested. The full details can be found here:<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=12099768#post12099768" rel="nofollow">RPG Net Thread</a><br/><br/>Anyone interested, I'll need a contact email so I can send out assignments and keep track of all the participants. Feel free to whisper if you don't want to give public details.<br/><br/>-Ash                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269827/#Comment_269827" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T12:32:05+00:00" title="May  3, 2010 12:32PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working on the official rules &amp; guidelines document at the mo, and will send it out to all the participants in a day or two.

Natch, prizes will only go to people who got their entry in before June 1st, but I'll accept that as being June 1st anywhere on the planet. Don't worry about time-zone.<br/><br/>The official guidelines will go out later today, and I'll start sending out the assignments soon after.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269883/#Comment_269883" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T02:00:23+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  2:00AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The contest guidelines just got sent out.
