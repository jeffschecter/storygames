Give me something setting appropriate to try to achieve while you tell me about the setting.   Once I'm setting literate and mechanics knowledgeable, I'll be able to make my own choices for the character.  But at the start not knowing where to go, along with not understanding how to get there or where I am, is a bad hat-trick.<br/><br/>If you don't feel right about railroading players into goals on pregens, then you can always ask leading questions and help get the character set on some appropriate direction.<br/><br/>After that its subsystems for mechanics and limited exposition on setting.<br/><br/>Don't give me big setting dumps of information.  Sliver it up and feed it to me in scenes where it makes sense.  Help players win at interactions with settings until they're comfortable with the setting.<br/> 'you know that he's a brigand of band X by the ritual scar above his left eye', rather than just 'you see a brigand with a scar' type of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315150/#Comment_315150" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-02T11:23:33+00:00" title="March  2, 2011 11:23AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would totally dig all of those things as aids in getting into a con game, Darren.<br/><br/>One thing that would be handy to me right off is to have it laid out what roles there are in the game (Is there a GM, or a Facilitator, or is there a round-controller that switches mechanically somehow?) and especially say what we're meant to be doing as players - like, is it kind of a two-player-game-while-sitting-next-to-others like Don't Rest Your Head, or is it stab-the-other-players like In A Wicked Age or etc. Like, answer the question "Where is the fun in this game?" And that'll tell me what to do. Danger Patrol: It's fun to describe wacky reasons why other players' actions endanger them, which actually helps the other player; and it's also fun to layer everything in the fiction with a retro-future sheen. Now i know what i'm supposed to do.<br/><br/>Also, yeah totally, lots of guidance cards can't go wrong. Unless it's impossible, let me make a few choices for my pre-gen character - like, the first time i played 4E D&amp;D was at a con, and i got to name my guy. That was enough for me. Don't make me make mechanical choices off the get-go if i could make stupid or less-effective choices, compare 4E D&amp;D to Apocalypse World in this case, i feel like AW doesn't have "bad" choices in character creation, except maybe "Oh, i made a character that doesn't fit well with the others in a short con game, or one that i don't actually want to play." <br/><br/>I've gotten a bad habit of assuming that i can just make anything up in settings, so guidelines around that &amp; pictures and stuff would certainly keep me on track. (for the record, the bad habit is in the assuming.)<br/><br/>i prefer a quick runthrough of the game procedure, like a tour through the halls, pointing out the bathroom and the kitchen without going in and standing near the toilet and showing me where the toilet paper is hanging. So, procedure and rhythm but only a nod to the mechanics? <br/><br/>i def. want a rules cheat sheet if i'm in competition with other people, 'cause i don't want to go tipping my hand about my plans if i need to ask about a rule, but otherwise i'd be fine without. But i, the individual, can always just hand that sheet back to you, whilst Jason (seated to my left) would really appreciate his. <br/><br/>Yay!

Do you like games that have a kind of tutorial section to them in the beginning?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome overview of the major currencies at work and IIEE issues.  Frex: don't tell me how a guns, knives, and lasers work in Savage Words, then tell me about Bennies.  Talk to me about Bennies, exploding dice, etc. then, if we have time, delve into specific mechanics.  System before mechanics and techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming you've got a one page character sheet, and a one page background sheet, what other handouts would be helpful? Rules cheat sheet? Relationship map? Illustrations of relevant setting elements?<br/>\n<br/>\nToo much paper.  I want a character sheet with highlights or breakout boxes that explain what is important.  Think of the image of a DVD player in an instruction manual, surrounded by numbered descriptors with lines going from the descriptors to the depiction of the DVD part in questions.  1 piece of paper.  Simplify the official character sheet to only those elements relevant for the scenario in question.  Frex: if you are running a Burning Wheel demo and you have decided that the only violence will be Bloody Versus tests, think of how much you could strip from the character sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 R-map easily accessible to all players.<br/>\n<br/>\nIllustrations?  Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't run a convention game in a few years, and I'm trying to get a feel for how to bring people into a new game in four hours without overwhelming them.

If I've never rolled a d20 then explain how all resolution revolves around a d20, target numbers and modifiers.
