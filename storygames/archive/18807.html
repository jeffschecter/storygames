We've talked about the nations that make up <a href="http://www.accursedrpg.com/search/label/World" rel="nofollow">the game world</a>, the <a href="http://www.accursedrpg.com/search/label/Witches" rel="nofollow">Witches </a>who invaded Morden, the <a href="http://www.accursedrpg.com/search/label/Banes" rel="nofollow">banes they created</a>, and the <a href="http://www.accursedrpg.com/search/label/Witchbreeds" rel="nofollow">Witchmarked monsters</a> who battle against them. Readers who have followed the postings have had more than 40 different posts to learn about the world. \n<p>Today, is the first chance we give gamers a chance to play in the world as well. We've just launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1231173913/accursed-rpg" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter project</a>, to bring the game to market. Ultimately, the development team has some talented game designers and editors, but we need artistic resources as well. Because of our unusual tone, stock artwork simply has not been an option for Accursed. Fortunately, we have some very talented artists who are willing to work with us, and our initial expenditures gave us a few preview pieces to help promote the setting.<br/></p><p>If the idea of playing a monster tormented by his essence while battling against more horrific beings inspires you, please take a moment to consider our project. Backers get an opportunity to <b>download the playtest rules</b> as soon as they pledge. This document offers background information on the world, character creation, and our customized system for tracking how a character has moved towards Denying or Accepting the curse that transforms the Witchmarked into a monster. It does require the Savage Worlds rules and the Horror Companion from Pinnacle. With those in hand, we think it can make for a great game experience.<br/></p><p>Good gaming!<br/></p><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1231173913/accursed-rpg" rel="nofollow">Please click here for the Kickstarter link. </a><br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/1004540_570739366323770_903461097_n.jpg"/></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421526/#Comment_421526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-15T14:06:09+00:00" title="September 15, 2013  2:06PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am really excited to see lots of women in the art, without them being hyper-sexualized or damsels-in-distress.

When the team started working on Accursed, we were pretty optimistic that we could create something special. When we took <a href="http://www.AccursedRPG.com" rel="nofollow">the blog live</a>, we were very happy with the response we received. As we started building towards the Kickstarter project, we received some very positive feedback and offers of collaboration from writer and artist contacts whom we respected. At Gen Con, we were thrilled by the feedback we received from those who saw our initial artwork and preliminary layouts.<br/><br/>None of that quite lives up to the sensation we're feeling now. Thank you so much for your belief, your trust, and your support. We'll do everything in our power to prove to you that it was all well placed. We're all very excited to start working up contracts with our artists and begin moving toward a number of great stretch goals.<br/><br/>For those interested in a little more personal interaction with the creative team, we'll be guests on the <a href="https://beautifulbrainsonline.com/chat-2/" rel="nofollow">Beautiful Brains chat</a> this Thursday (9/19/13) night at 9:00 PM EDT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnDunn" title="JohnDunn"><img alt="JohnDunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/n4PDN3C57OEW2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnDunn">JohnDunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422191/#Comment_422191" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T06:42:57+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  6:42AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick note to let folks know about the latest Kickstarter update.

Even $1 backers count toward reaching that.<br/><br/>We're also more than 10% of the way toward achieving a $20,000 stretch goal. At that one, Chris Avellone and George Ziets (two developers from Torment: Tides of Numenera) will write a sourcebook that presents additional details about two of Morden's nations.<br/><br/>There are lots of big things left on the table, but there's little time to achieve them, as the Kickstarter ends in just a few more days.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnDunn" title="JohnDunn"><img alt="JohnDunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/n4PDN3C57OEW2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnDunn">JohnDunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422682/#Comment_422682" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T05:49:33+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  5:49AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As of this writing, we have just over three days in the Accursed Kickstarter. Soon, the counter will be ticking over and measuring hours remaining instead of days. We've made fantastic progress over the course of the campaign and the last few days especially. Nearing the end of the run, it's time for one last concerted push. <br/>After unlocking the poker deck, we had a number of backers ask if we could do a bit more with it. So, we crunched some numbers and decided to set an additional bonus goal. If the Kickstarter reaches 450 backers (we're over 410 now), we're going to expand the poker deck. Instead of having four suits, it'll have six. These will include the four standard four suits, plus two new ones \u2013 Red Drops and Black Moons. (Yes, we'll add in a third Joker too.) The two new suits will use imagery from the Witchbreeds that our backers at the Curse Maker level are creating. (Yes, those suit names have connections to the Witchbreeds that our Curse Makers have in development.) Here's the working concept for their icons:<br/><img alt="image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/010/299/371f5a88ca11c02e7d352a55f52f35f6_large.png"/><br/>Now, to be fair, not everyone will want six suits. Many people are perfectly happy with the standard four. Because we're using print on demand technology, that isn't a problem at all. Any backers who choose the Accursed Poker Deck as one of their add-ons will receive both a 4-suit and a 6-suit version of the electronic file. When they go to order the deck, they'll have their choice of purchasing either the 4-suit or 6 suit version. One caveat \u2013 print on demand decks are priced based on the number of cards. While we expect the standard poker deck to be ~$5, the 6 suit deck will be closer to $8. <br/><br/>"What about fans of the Chimera or Baba Yaga?" you ask. Well, let's get to 450 backers first, and then we'll see what we can do. <br/><br/>Thanks for your continued support!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnDunn" title="JohnDunn"><img alt="JohnDunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/n4PDN3C57OEW2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnDunn">JohnDunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422764/#Comment_422764" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T05:49:50+00:00" title="October 12, 2013  5:49AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have just over 24 hours left to go in the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1231173913/accursed-rpg" rel="nofollow">Accursed Kickstarter</a>, and the ride has gotten crazier. Last night, we achieved a stretch goal AND a bonus goal. We're now more than a third of the way toward achieving the next stretch goal. Time is quickly running out on the Kickstarter. If you think this sounds like a compelling setting, and you'd like to see it reach its best potential early on, then now is the time to jump on board.<br/><br/>Here's a quick recap:<br/>The book will be 144, full-color pages, with full-color interior artwork.<br/>Andy Chambers is writing the Introductory Fiction<br/>Sean Patrick Fannon will be writing an adventure for Accursed. <br/>Rich Baker will be writing an adventure for Accursed. <br/>Mel Odom will be writing a novella set in Morden, the world of Accursed. <br/>Colin McComb, Sean Preston, Shane Hensley, and Adam Jury will each be writing a 1-sheet style adventure for Accursed. <br/>We'll be creating a 6-suit poker deck that features the artwork of Accursed.<br/>Chris Avellone and George Ziets will be writing a sourcebook that expands the history and personality of two of the nations in Morden (the Accursed setting).<br/><br/>Here are the next two stretch goals:<br/><b>$22,000</b> Stretch Goal (Funded + $12,000) If we achieve this level of funding, fantasy author Richard Lee Byers will write a novella that takes place within the Accursed setting. <br/><b>$25,000</b> (Funded + $15,000) If we achieve this level of funding, accomplished game designer Owen K.C. Stephens will create a Pathfinder system conversion for Accursed. <br/><br/>Finally, as a bonus goal, if we reach 525 backers, we'll make the poker deck have 8 suits.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking a look!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
