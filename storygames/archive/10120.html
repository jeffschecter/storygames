First time, it totally sucked. We checked the rulebook and saw we missed a bunch of really important things. Damnit! We could feel there was a great game there. Second time, hey, this is really neat! Good drama. But still not great. Looked some more and I think I've got a hold of most things. We're gonna do it again on Sunday.<br/><br/>But there's one thing I can't wrap my head around. So you've got a conflict. One villain, multiple heroes. The rules state that each exchange should end with the GM's turn, so that the player can think about her next move. Fine. But an attack doesn't actually land until the opponent plays her card. You play a card, describe the attack. Opponent plays a card, describes a response to that attack (often "I take the punch but now I retaliate ever harder!", but sometimes cancelling and stuff). Problem here is, the villain is constantly getting attacked and beaten up before her attacks land. Like this:<br/><br/>Player 1: I kick her!<br/>GM: She says "ouch!" She lunges at you!<br/>Player 2: I kick her!<br/>GM: She says "ouch again!" Now she lunges at YOU!<br/>Player 1: I kick her!<br/>etc.<br/><br/>See what's happening? The villain's attack is not complete until the response has been made by the player. But when it's the player's turn to respond, the villain has had to defend herself from (or, more often, been beaten up by) the other hero. So the attack has effectively been broken already, in the fiction, but not in the mechanics. This has the unfortunate effect of the villain never landing a single blow.<br/><br/>WTF?<br/><br/>------------<br/>Also, all general advice on running WGP is appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224628/#Comment_224628" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T01:52:49+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  1:52AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd think this was a problem in the designer not explaining the reasoning behind that particular mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224809/#Comment_224809" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T00:49:30+00:00" title="August 15, 2009 12:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>I'd think this was a problem in the designer not explaining the reasoning behind that particular mechanic.</blockquote>\nBut he does. He says it's because the GM has a lot of things to think about, while the player only has her character. So the player can use then time when the villain is fighting someone else to think of her next move. Which makes sense, but I can't get it to work narratively.<br/><br/>Please? Anyone? I'm supposed to be running this tomorrow and I really want this issue ironed out, because otherwise I'm not sure if I wanna play it.

Since it didn't even come up, it's a bit hard to say what we did to avoid it.  IIRC, it was mostly a matter of narrating lots of "active defense."  So, I remember it being something more like:<br/><br/>Robot Man: I blast the Hive with my super-lasers!<br/>GM: The Mumbral Hive scatters to evade your lasers and then swarms right toward you!<br/>Captain Future: I download Zero-G jujitsu from my temporal uplink and fend them off with a flurry of jabs!<br/>GM: You crush several of the wasps, but another jabs its stinger into you as you try to roll out of the way!<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>Not sure if that's helpful, but to the best of my memory it's how it played out for us.<br/><br/>ETA: Re-reading your OP... I guess part of it also was that we didn't play it as "the blow can't land until all the cards are on the table" so much as "the ultimate effect in the fiction can't be resolved until all the cards are on the table."  So, e.g., you can hit someone with a laser, but that may not hurt them severely, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224844/#Comment_224844" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T09:16:37+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  9:16AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>Simon,<br/>ETA: Re-reading your OP...

However, the rules quite clearly say:<br/><br/>"Feel free to describe how your mighty power blasts melt through steel girders before you turn and target your opponent, but stop there. Don't describe them hitting him and don't describe them hurting him. His respone to your panel will incorporate those things."<br/><br/>I guess we can break that rule and try to work around the problem, but it seems there will have to be some narrative retrofitting at every panel, which I feel will be hard to make work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224849/#Comment_224849" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T09:49:43+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  9:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, I think you've answered it, if you combine it with Daniel's reply.<br/><br/>Player 1: I kick the villain.<br/>Player 2: I toss a car at the villain.<br/>Villain: I reply to the above two by... and then I do X to them.<br/>Player 1: I react this way, and proceed with...<br/>Player 2: Ditto.<br/>Villain: I reply to the above two by... and then I do X to them.<br/><br/>Yes, you announce intent and not result, this does not mean that the villain must reply immediately.

The player plays a card and says what her character does, then the GM plays a card in response, that's either an escalation, a cancellation or a change of tactics. If the GM responds to both players at once, she'll have to play two different cards, which might result in escalating the one and cancelling the other, for example. While I think it'd be possible to do it this way, it seems like a lot of work for the GM, having to play against all the players at the same time, instead of one at a time, as is intended in the rules.<br/><br/>Still, it's a possibility. If I don't get any better answer, I'll discuss this with the guys before we start playing.

So, OK, you can't land the blow until the response.  But, going with Guy's point, why couldn't it be something like this, imagining that it's sort of like intercutting panels in a comic:<br/><br/>PC1: I throw a car at the villain!<br/>GM: She uses her telekinetic powers to smash the car to shards and send it flying back at you!<br/>PC2: While she's doing that, I shoot her with my mega-ray!<br/>GM: The mega-ray sears her skin, but she grits her teeth and attacks you in a flurry of claws!<br/>PC1: Aah!  I duck behind  a wall for cover from the hail of car parts, then throw the freaking wall at her!<br/><br/>I mean, if you had, like 10PCs, it might be a lot to keep track of, but it doesn't sound like it breaks the fiction, so long as all players remember that they have to respond to whatever the villain threw at them last time.  Imagine it as, like after seeing the car blow apart, we cut to a different angle with the mega-ray, and only then return to see what happened with the car. Think of every action movie where you see the building explode sixteen times from different angles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224892/#Comment_224892" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T00:08:28+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 12:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, that works only as long as the villain is using long range powers, yeah?

You've quoted from page 66.<br/>\n<br/>\n"<i>How to Ink it:</i> When inking your panels, remember that you can include anything that your character is doing to prevail in the conflict, but cannot include how that affects your opponent.  Feel free to describe how your mighty power blasts melt through steel girders before you turn and target your opponent, but stop there.  Don't describe them hitting him, and don't describe them hurting him. <b>His response to your panel will incorporate those things</b>"<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me also Quote your simplified example of play:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Player 1: I kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch!" She lunges at you!<br/>\nPlayer 2: I kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch again!" Now she lunges at YOU!<br/>\nPlayer 1: I kick her!<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee what's happening? The villain's attack is not complete until the response has been made by the player. But when it's the player's turn to respond, the villain has had to defend herself from (or, more often, been beaten up by) the other hero. So the attack has effectively been broken already, in the fiction, but not in the mechanics. This has the unfortunate effect of the villain never landing a single blow.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot happening here.  For one thing the Heroes should being saying "Kick at" rather than kick. The villain isn't responding in the same tactic.  The Heroes don't seem to be reacting to the Villain but rather the Villain is aborting the action of a previous Hero in order to react to a current Hero.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming your playing with each Hero having their own Hero Conflict Sheet.  Player 1 plays a card sets the Tactic to Punch-Strike-Kick says "I kick the Villian."  The Gm should be playing a card and responding with a Punch-Strike-Kick.  To respond with a lunge implies a change of tactics.  Based on the simplifed example play as described looks like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer 1: (Plays a 8 of clubs on Hero1 Sheet)(chooses Punch-Strike-Kick Tactic on Hero1 Conflict Sheet) I kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch!" (discards a 6 of diamonds and plays a 4 of diamonds on Hero1 Conflict Sheet)(changes the tactic on Hero1 Conflict Sheet to Dodge-Maneuver) She lunges at you!<br/>\nPlayer 2: (Plays a 4 of spades on Hero2 Conflict Sheet)(chooses Punch-Strike-Kick Tactic on Hero2 Conflict Sheet) kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch again!"  (discards a 4 of clubs and plays a 5 of clubs on Hero2 Conflict Sheet)(changes the tactic on Hero1 Conflict Sheet to Dodge-Maneuver) Now she lunges at YOU!<br/>\nPlayer 1: I kick her!  (Player 1 in error because GM had changed tactics)<br/>\n<br/>\nIm going to Assume there wasn't as much suit changing so maybe it should look like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer 1: (Plays a 8 of clubs on Hero1 Sheet)(chooses Punch-Strike-Kick Tactic on Hero1 Conflict Sheet) I kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch!" (Plays a 9 of Clubs Hero1 Conflict Sheet)(no change to tactic) She Punches at you!<br/>\nPlayer 2: (Plays a 4 of spades on Hero2 Conflict Sheet)(chooses Punch-Strike-Kick Tactic on Hero2 Conflict Sheet) I kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch again!"  (Plays a 5 of Spades on Hero2 Conflict Sheet)(no change to the tactic) Now she Punches at YOU!<br/>\nPlayer 1: I kick her!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Error here is the GM aborting Punching at Player 1 in order to punch at player 2.  The Villain Doesn't need to abort punching at Player One the Villain is tough enough and fast enough to hit them both.  Also there are no minions in the example.  When the Second hero goes to kick the villian the villian's minions should be jumping him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I'd play this<br/>\nPlayer 1: (Plays a 8 of clubs on Hero1 Sheet)(chooses Punch-Strike-Kick Tactic on Hero1 Conflict Sheet) I kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch!" (plays a 9 of clubs on Hero1 Conflict Sheet)(no change) "Kick me will ya" She says sending a fierce punch to the hero's jaw<br/>\nPlayer 2: (Plays a 4 of spades on Hero2 Conflict Sheet)(chooses Punch-Strike-Kick Tactic on Hero2 Conflict Sheet) kick her!<br/>\nGM: She says "ouch again!"  (discards a 4 of clubs and plays a 5 of clubs on Hero2 Conflict Sheet)(changes the tactic on Hero2 Conflict Sheet to Persuasion-Threatening-Gloating) "Oh Great, the side kick 'copy-boy' has arrived.  I don't have time for you now, mommy's fighting a real hero."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer 1: still has to deal with my punch and if Player 2 wants to kick me again he's going to have to discard cards to change tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM has more cards and should use them to control how the Hero's can react.  Use minions, mind control helpless victims into fighting for you. use your powers a lot and if you ever get into a position where you are tempted to abort an action to deal with a new Hero's action either cancel the new hero's action or yeild.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224915/#Comment_224915" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T11:30:07+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 11:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2009 11:31AM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Kat! That's a well-written and thoughtful response.<br><br>I guess it's just that I (and the others) have a hard time wrapping my head around it. The villains is launching a punch, then she's being kicked (still launching the punch), then she delivers some gloating (punch still hasn't hit) and THEN we get to see what happened with the punch. I'm all "What huh? That old punch?" And if there are three heroes, it gets even more strained. But maybe some minions can alleviate the problem, and maybe part of the issue is that I've never read a superhero comic.<br><br>I still think it's a problem, but now I've gotten a number of tactics to work around it (villain throwing things, using minions). Maybe I can make it work!<br><br>Oh, and the game was supposed to be today, but fell through, so I'll have to wait until next time.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
