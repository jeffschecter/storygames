So here it is.  I basically asked two things (though I'd like for the conversation to blossom beyond those two if it's fertile ground):<br/><br/>How much benefit would be gained by us deciding to start our G+ threads with a bold header as a subject line?  I could throw *Custom map of Dis* up before I started typing up my stuff.  If we just decided to start doing that, it would be quicker to filter as we read.  But there's no 'subject' or 'discussion title' box to fill out so is it just fighting an up-hill battle against Google?<br/><br/>And how do you use hashtags over there?  I almost haven't.  I've only contributed to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23fridayfiveminutemap&amp;Mode=like">#fridayfiveminutemap</a> and I was doing it just so it would be easy to search for.  But that makes it sound, correctly, like I was thinking of it as a little gimmick rather than something profoundly important.  And most of the other hashtag uses I've seen have been jokey things like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23firstworldproblems&amp;Mode=like">#firstworldproblems</a> or even less useful and less class-like.  Are you using hashtags for real on G+?  How?  What's the payoff?  When do they get in the way?  (When there are five and they're all pat-yourself-on-the-back-for-being-clever instead of actually useful, would be my answer.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411289/#Comment_411289" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-04T08:47:27+00:00" title="April  4, 2013  8:47AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Subject lines?

Your fight will be more with folks who don't confirm to your request. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Most of what I see, however, is posted links, which provide a subject context, followed by commentary. I very rarely see posts initiated by pure commentary, though Jason Morningstar is a prolific one for flash narratives or dropping some history.<br/><br/>I've never used a hashtag except as a joke. I doubt I'd want to bother learning--can't you just, like, search on ANY word in your feed? <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/Tenra%20bansho%20zero" rel="nofollow">Yes, you can.</a> So what do hashtags accomplish? A way to subscribe to a subject type ON TWITTER. If you want to subscribe to a subject type on G+... use Search or join the Community for the subject, I suppose.

I got the book and two weeks later (or whatever) I'd finished it and wanted to comment.  So I searched for the book's name.  And got nothing.  And then permuted the search a few times thinking it had to be easy.  Nothing.  I ended up clicking her name and scrolling down through several loads of posts in order to find it.  So I don't think that search is really an answer for many, many (most?) scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411292/#Comment_411292" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-04T09:46:33+00:00" title="April  4, 2013  9:46AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely start with bold headers.

For instance, Christopher, you seem to find it easier to remember some unique hashtag on which to search than to remember the name of the book and the person who commented on it?<br/><br/>But if one can't subscribe to a hashtag, then what's the point? How is it any better searching for a hashtag than for a normal word? Because the # symbol disambiguates the SPECIFIC meaning of the hashtag from the GENERAL meaning of the words that comprise it? (That actually makes a weird sort of sense: the # indicates "Category:___", to use a wiki metaphor.)<br/><br/>If SO.... Meh. I got nothin'. I generally find I don't have the mental strength to develop categorical standards, knowing (a) they'll engender inevitable conflict over organization and scope and scale and (b) they'll never be complete; and so (c) some knucklehead will drift the whole categorization schema when he needs a new category, which (d) fucking defeats the purpose of categories being predictable and enabling discovery (not just sorting what you already know).<br/><br/>I deal with that shit ALL DAY at work. From people paid to do it right and thoroughly and follow the rules... who STILL fuck everything up on the regular.<br/><br/>[Heh...
