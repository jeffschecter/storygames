We played after a dinner: four of us, two couples. The mixes were pretty widely varied from 70s sex-pop to modern covers of classical and Renaissance pieces. We were people who had all gone to high school together in Churchill, Manitoba, and we were meeting in Winnipeg and driving back to Churchill for a friend's wedding -- a wedding we all hoped to stop.<br/><br/>Laughs were had, tears were shed, and one of us, the overworked, super-successful attach\xe9 to the US State Department, turned out to be our protagonist, when he gave up both his dreams of a major promotion and his shot at getting one of the other PCs to fall in love with him.<br/><br/>Good times, big ups.

He brought a mix called "Australia 2002," I believe, a fact which itself is pure genius - labeling a mix as being for an imaginary roadtrip! Ha!<br/><br/>The session opened with Michael's mix, To Whom It May Concern: Emotional Hardcore 1985-1995. Based on those opening songs, we decided we were searching for a vanished sibling/friend. We ended the game sailing around the cove in a rowboat, looking for our friend, finally giving up.<br/><br/>Gilbert's character, an old vietnam vet who coughed blood throughout the trip, turned out to be the protagonist. I thought of him as a firmly sideline character, until the very last scene - told in flashback, which suddenly changed the group's understanding of everything else that'd happened in the session. It was like... this one pivotal decision that rewrote our understanding of how we'd all come to be there. Gah! So good! I don't really want to tell you what the revelation was, though. GIlbert can if he wants to.<br/><br/>That session is probably in my Top 10.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elegua" title="elegua"><img alt="elegua" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elegua">elegua</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352479/#Comment_352479" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-25T13:47:25+00:00" title="December 25, 2011  1:47PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The details aren't likely to be all that interesting for folks who weren't in the room that day. It's one of those things which has to be appreciated based on the mental journey which brought us there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat stood out for me is that the final scene was accidental. We were nearly at time for the room we were in and had agreed to stop at the end of the previous scene, but we started a new song and just ran with it. So frequently in other stories we tell as a group, we have to stretch a bit to string together the scenes to find that narrative continuity. This time it was different and best of all it was unplanned and unexpected, exactly the sort of thing a lot of us strive for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus" title="EpsilonMinus"><img alt="EpsilonMinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus">EpsilonMinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352487/#Comment_352487" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-25T22:40:51+00:00" title="December 25, 2011 10:40PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that game fondly.
