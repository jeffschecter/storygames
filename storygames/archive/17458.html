They are still dense reading but worth a reconsider. Lets let <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/narr_essay.html" rel="nofollow">Ron's words</a> speak for themselves. I know he has very specific meanings he wanted to get at. Instead I'd like to talk about what people have taken away from these ideas and how it has influenced their design work.<br/><br/>For me, when I joined the Forge in 2005, I was trying to figure out what was going on in this new scene. I'd been doing my own version of story game for the previous 17 years and was very pleased to see other people doing similar games. The first struggle was to figure out how Engle Matrix Games fit into this model. EMG players were always able to say what any character could do - so the players were in the author stance. Players made up much of the content of the game game but also competed against one another so there was always a gamist element to it. Whither they were narrativist or not was always unclear to me.<br/><br/>One thing I knew pretty fast is that EMGs didn't use premise like Ron described it. There was no compelling question like "How far with you go to accomplish your ends?" MG stories were more like "Hey kids! I've got a game, lets put on a show!" so no gripping moral dilemma. I liked cool acting to come up but it wasn't built into the system. There was no "Fortune in the middle" or dice pool mechanics. And MGs always had some kind of plot track to help guide players through a story so the story was not the compelling human interaction between the players. <br/><br/>It was all very confusing and I'm not certain I ever fully figured it out - and that didn't matter. In the long run the message of the Forge discussions was "You can make up your own games and publish them without the three tier distribution model." Which I did and still do.<br/><br/>The biggest design influence I've felt over the years is the need to simplify my rules and get the hell out of the way of people's creativity. Each year I trim off a little more, and a little more. Technology now allows me to make the games in different ways so all the lights are green to keep this up. <br/><br/>So I throw this out there. How did these discussions impact you? And what were your understandings of Story Now?<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395397/#Comment_395397" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T11:00:12+00:00" title="October 30, 2012 11:00AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you want to talk about Story Now, or do you want to talk about our take-away from the old Forge discussions?

Many of the classic Forge-inspired games take a particular genre or narrative situation and then attempt to create a tailored set of mechanics that get at the core of that situation, while minimizing other elements that would distract from the core experience of play. "Story Now" in this sense meant skipping directly to dealing with the core things that a genre or situation are about, rather than using a system based on skills+attributes to dance around the major themes.<br/><br/>Interestingly, most of these games sit halfway between so-called "generic/universal" design styles and crafting a game around a particular situation. That is to say, they allow you to play out narratives of a particular genre or type. Sorcerer, My Life with Master, etc. are the best examples of this. Some games were more specific, like The Mountain Witch, Polaris, or Dogs in the Vineyard, but people often tried generalizing those situations to cover broader genres ("Jedi in the Vineyard").<br/><br/>Many of the innovative mechanics and structures that came out of the Forge were inspired directly by such genre tropes, but over time the "innovative mechanics" thing kind of became a meme in its own right, which didn't always lead to super-successful games. Trying to be innovative is a lot harder than just making the mechanics that match the thing you're trying to do. Many of those flash-in-the-pan games aren't seeing consistent play these days.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my main takeaways when I think back on the role that the Forge has had in the history of RPG design. I'm not sure whether more specific ideas about Narrativism will leave a long-term impact 20-30 years down the road, but the type of design work that came out of the Forge is changing the way people approach designing games in a major way. We're still seeing the ripple effects of that transformation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395459/#Comment_395459" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T16:00:35+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  4:00PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the most important lesson I've taken away from my (usually lurking, occasionally grating) presence at the Forge is: <i><b>when designing a game, I don't have anybody to please but myself</b></i>.<br/>This was later rectified, thanks to Vincent Baker, by adding: <i><b>\u2026and the people I'm gonna play said game with.<br/></b></i><br/><br/>Additional useful lessons on the side include:\n<ul><li>There's no time-limit to game-making and no need to hurry.</li>\n<li>No matter how long you take, you're never <i>done</i> making a game \u2014 and that's totally fine.</li>\n<li>A game can be a statement.

I recognize that you've done a lot of different stuff with your basic mechanics and way to phrase a fiction, so I'm not surprised if individual implementations swing between CAs. The Matrix mechanics fare well for gamist and simulationist play, too, so it mostly depends on how the game encourages the group to treat its source material. Give the players some questions to ponder about the nature of humanity and you've got narrativism, or tell them that only one can be king in the end and then you've got gamism, and so on.<br/><br/>As for the Story Now essay and the concept of narrativism, they've been important to me, but not in the ideological sense that everybody seems to bring to these discussions. It's not important to me whether somebody else <i>believes</i> in some dogma or any bullshit like that because the proof is in the pudding: can your game hack it in the marketplace? Are you artistically relevant for our times? Do you have fun playing games? In my case the Forge theory has helped me achieve these goals, so I've nothing to complain about. <i>Utility of interpretation</i> is the way I think about rpg theory: there's a lot of theory out there that is not creatively relevant or easily falsifiable, but why should I care about it then? Is it somehow useful to spend your time convincing other people that they're wrong on a matter of abstraction? At one time it was popular to construct rpg "theories" to oppose GNS where seemingly the only goal of the exercise was to reify the aspects of roleplaying that you personally found the most important. The theories where you'd just add a fourth "classification" to GNS were especially adorable, like that thing where Immersion was the fourth agenda. What kind of truth is there to be found in this sort of Internet game?<br/><br/>Regarding the practical merits of narrativism, I would find it ludicrous or ignorant if someone were to posit the concept useless at this point in time. So many game designers have used the theory and the specific concept of a narrativist agenda in creating successful games that fulfill their own creative needs as well as those of their audience. (Note that I don't mean designers who've copied other people or who've just made games they like and happened to get a narrativist design out of the process; there are several designers who have quite intentionally and directly utilized the theory in creating their games, myself included.) The fact that some other people find the theory useless for their own purposes is secondary to some degree. Sure, we can talk about what the theory says and how we use it beneficially, but if somebody else thinks differently or wants different things out of roleplaying, then there is no guarantee whatsoever that messing with narrativist theory would bring them any benefit.<br/><br/>Ultimately I'd like people like Jason up there, with whom we've had these discussions about the usefulness of narrativism, to create alternate frameworks that have superior utility. That's how we advance. I wouldn't be surprised if such advance would be Hegelian in nature, with some sort of synthesis looming there in the horizon. As long as nobody stumbles on a better means of explaining this particular creative agenda (or a better way to understand the creative process than the very concept of creative agenda, as the case may be), though, it seems to me that narrativism is here to stay with its moral premises and Egri and all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396813/#Comment_396813" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T22:25:17+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 10:25PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story Now means the players are having fun right now, and their PCs are making a difference and doing the things that the players game for Right Now. Not in two weeks or two months or two years of slogging through set up where they can't do the cool stuff.<br/><br/>This isn't to say one can't have set up, but either you have set up grow out of what's happening now (the zero to low prep option) or you (possibly combine that with) plant things that won't get in the way of the PCs kicking ass and taking names Right Now (or doing whatever it is the players find makes the game fun / cool / not a slugging through some bullshit paying of dues before they get to be cool and have fun).<br/><br/>I came up with a reality check there. Look back at last few sessions. Do you think the players were having fun? Or were you so wrapped up in where you were going with the game that a) you don't know or b) if you're being honest, probably they weren't? And, of course, communicate with your players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396815/#Comment_396815" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T22:52:26+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 10:52PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa, "Fun Now" is definitely a manifesto I can get behind (bad pacing is probably my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> bugaboo of bad GMing), but Story Now as a creative agenda really has nothing to do with that.
