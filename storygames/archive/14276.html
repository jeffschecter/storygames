Though overbearing and short-tempered, Scott is a hero to his fellow players--that is, until neo-nerd hipster Miles Butler joins the game, fueling Scott's rampant insecurity and alienating him from his own players.  Can Scott overcome his contempt for the mainstreaming of nerdery, or will this clash of the subcultures come to a head?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/zerocharismamovie" rel="nofollow">Zero Charisma</a><br/><br/>I am curious about this movie - it looks cute and fun and awesome and in a weird way that I don't see a lot, it makes me feel for both the protagonist and the antagonist at the same time.  I'm definitely old-school about my nerdiness (even though I wasn't born when D&amp;D first came out or anything) but I also definitely feel like the "hipster douchebag neo-nerd" that's the main antagonist of the film.<br/><br/>It brings up something I'm really interested in - internal identification and the divisiveness of "nerd" subculture.

Even the most tolerant and open-minded folks seem to have a point where they snap - where they look at a Star Trek fan, or a video gamer, and want to scream, "Can't you just be normal?!" <br/><br/>We were fascinated by the fact that in our culture, we don't judge people if they wear the jersey of their favorite basketball team everyday of the week, or obsess over fantasy football, or paint their faces in their team's colors... but good old fashioned geeks are still fair game to ridicule.<br/><br/>Also, The Dungeon Master is based on a true story. Mostly.<br/><br/>When we were kids, we were both geeks - we played Dungeons and Dragons and all sorts of other things that make you a social outcast as an adult. As teenagers, we discovered how uncool girls thought these activities were, and so we let them fall by the wayside.<br/><br/>We couldn't remember all the rules, and so we invited a friend-of-a-friend to come and help us. When this person came to our big game night, he was - in many ways - a stereotypical, awkward geek. We all got along fine and had an OK time, but the next morning the two of us realized a couple things: 1) that we felt compelled to make fun of this poor guy, and 2) that we were doing so out of of our own insecurity.<br/><br/>We were too cool. Our irony was a self-defense mechanism - and we were letting our insecurities get in the way of having a good time. We were acting like self-loathing snobs who go to a dance, and then stand on the sidelines and make fun of the people dancing. If we were honest with ourselves, we wanted to participate in a geeky activity, but we were still scared of being perceived as geeks. The Dungeon Master was our way to dramatize this tension and weave it into a fun, revenge-of-the-nerds narrative.blockquote&gt;</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324131/#Comment_324131" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T12:14:49+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 12:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember seeing the trailer for "The Dungeon Master" and getting similar feelings, though a lot more uncomfortable ones.

I've met people who work in pornography pretending to like RPGs. You see models in cosplay going to conventions (who aren't paid to be there but looking for work). But I suspect the number of people pretending is small compared to the number of people who just feel comfortable now expressing their nerdy interests.<br/><br/>And the backlash isn't focused at all. If my friends are shopping for a video game, there isn't much of an agenda other than\u2026 I want to give you my hard earned money in exchange for this game\u2026 and yet they are met with disdain for being female! <br/><br/>Hipster is also often used as a pejorative term. If people don't like someone, they try to demean them by calling them names rather than dealing with real issues. You're playing an RPG with social mechanics\u2026 hipster! (real example).<br/><br/>I've also had nerds tell us that we aren't nerds because we choose to be nerds rather than being forced to be nerds. We play RPGs because we want to.

That said, I think it's an easy angle for popularity, especially online.  I had a female friend who would ask me questions about nerdy things so she could seem more knowledgeable online.<br/><br/>I guess the question here is - why is that attitude so prevalent?  I mean, shouldn't we WANT more people to like the stuff we like?<br/><br/>If you're not very cool, and you're part of a group of people who aren't very cool, and it seems you're not cool because of the group you're a part of, and someone cool shows up and says they're a part of your group, it shatters the perception that you're not cool because of what you do. Suddenly you have to self reflect, and there's the question of "Well Vin Diesel is sexy, and he likes D&amp;D, why aren't you?" You can't just say that you're misunderstood and people pick on you because of your hobby, that you /by choice/* made a big part of your life.<br/><br/>*maybe it's not by choice though, if you were physically talented you'd be part of sports teams, and people would like you because you bring the school glory, instead you go to the circle where all the outcasts who can't make it anywhere else go, and you pretend to be a warrior who brings his village glory. you don't want to admit it was your last resort, you're a nerd because you couldn't be anything else, while some other person is a party animal, an athlete and a nerd at the same time. maybe he's even more nerdy than you. you've got an Int of 12, and are sitting under 8 for every other score, with a Charisma of 5, and you can kind of feel like you're smart by comparing yourself to yourself, but having someone else come along with a good set of 13s and 14s, including a 14 in Int, and that really makes you feel bad about yourself.<br/><br/>====<br/><br/>All speculation of course, I'm just trying to get into character of someone who gets upset that another person joins their group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324140/#Comment_324140" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T12:55:03+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 12:55PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have kinda complicated feelings about this.

Subcultures are essentially about style, aesthetics and serious leisure. Those are what we talk about most in the sociological literature. <br/><br/>One often becomes a member in due some kind of exclusion or trauma in childhood or adolescence (if you can forgive the pop psycho-analysis) because they offer acceptance, community and a communal leisure activity. We usually call this 'serious leisure' to indicate that it's not a causal activity but rather a community-based affinity group. The differences between BDSM kinksters, train-hobbyists and Table-Top RPGers is in content and not structure.<br/><br/>I think where the tension comes from is the perceived differences in social capital and status, and the contest thereof. Robert hits the nail on the head, it's about tolerating shitty social behaviour rather than any kind of actual threat.<br/><br/>I've notice that in both goth/punk scenes and the RPG nerd scene there is this tolerance of poor social skill and general assholery.

Based on what I saw, I didn't identify with either of the main characters and I don't see most of my gaming brothers and sisters over the last thirty-two years in either of those stereotypes.  I've more often seen socially backward behavior from guys in Steelers jerseys than in the people I've chosen to game with.<br/><br/>I did like <i>Freaks and Geeks</i> because we got a lot of character development that made them more than stereotypes.  That's something that's more difficult to do in a film, but it doesn't appear as though <i>Zero Charisma</i> is even going to attempt it.<br/><br/>Stereotypes were present, but I mostly enjoyed the treatment of Augie and his compatriots in <i>Role Models</i>.  Maybe the writing just hit my funny bone the right way and made me more forgiving.<br/><br/>Most gamers I know are empathetic, clever and social types who can compete on a number of different fields, people like Stephen Colbert or Patton Oswalt.  They're self-deprecating because they're fun, funny and humble people but deep down they know their chosen forms of geekery are no more backward than those of fishermen, knitters, or fantasy football enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I think you can write a script than recognizes various absurdities in human behavior and clannishness that doesn't rely on these really old and tired stereotypes.  <i>Zero Charisma</i> appears lazy to me.  <br/><br/>But sometimes previews are really bad/misleading; some idiot puts all the easy yuks, (some which don't even make their way into the final cut), into the trailer.<br/><br/>edit: I don't know that F&amp;G broke any molds either, but it had nuance and excellent writing and performances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324242/#Comment_324242" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T20:31:32+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  8:31PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good writing and decent performance goes a LONG way to excuse errant premise or stereotypical elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324252/#Comment_324252" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T21:39:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  9:39PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>But they're still comedies, not something that is attempting to portray me.</blockquote>\nCriminitly, don't go into the law, or become a cop, or anything.  <br/><br/>It's just a laff em up movie, should be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marqos" title="marqos"><img alt="marqos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/850/nXOPCJBZCOJ7Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marqos">marqos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324256/#Comment_324256" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T23:44:46+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 11:44PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Story Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo, 15 minutes after I finished reading this thread, I heard the theme music from The Simpsons from the other room and so I popped out to catch an episode.

I'm always annoyed that I seem to be the only geek-type I know who's immediately turned off by this sort of thing while everyone else laps it up. (That's right -- I said "laps!") My least favorite episode of Community, a show I normally enjoy, is the D&amp;D episode. Ugh. Just... awful for a number of reasons, some nitpickier than others.<br/><br/>That blurb about The Dungeon Master makes it extra-unappealing to me. When people outside "the culture" make media about "the culture," it always feels cheap and exploitative -- at least, from inside "the culture," anyway. My mom's a big fan of Big Bang Theory, and frequently tries to get me to watch it, but I find it unbearable. It comes off as what people who aren't geeks figure geeks must be like, which ultimately feels like a lot of pointing and laughing.<br/><br/>The only decent movies of this ilk I've seen are The Gamers movies.

I've complicated relationships out of insecurity and distrust in the past.  I regret it.<br/><br/>There's some part of me that will always be angry when i see someone beautiful or popular wearing a Thundercats Tshirt.  There will always be a part of me that wants to shout "Get the fuck out of my subculture and leave the fake-faded Green Lantern patch when you go."  I recognize that a lot of this stems from a life in a smallish midwestern city, where i could literally see the people around me go from being bullies that mocked me for liking Star Wars to the hippy-dressed MTV generation with a 30minute-television-special based knowledge of Lord of the Rings.  There's part of me that wants them to have to earn this thing i like the way i had to earn it.  I get why people want to exclude girls, hipsters, or anyone who just chose to join the role-playing culture.<br/><br/>But i don't like that part of me.<br/><br/>I don't really have an answer, but i want to share what i've been trying to do, to cope with my own crap.  I'm trying to deal with the individual.  Before i sink in honest self-realization or jealousy, having to admit to myself that i'd love to be skinny or gorgeous or fit in with the crowds at a Wilco concert, and before i harden with bitterness, wanting to replay all the times i watched family or classmates roll their eyes at all the weird crap i was saying about elves and blasters and comic books, i try to focus on who i am and who i'm talking to.  Especially if it's a stranger to me or a stranger to my subculture.<br/><br/>I'm trying to allow for genuine reactions.  Because, yes, there is something so beautiful and real about a person who wore a Three Wolf Moon shirt before it was a hit joke.  I adore those people.  Those blessed with a zero charisma are a bit lucky, because they're often being exactly who they are, even when it gets them ostracized or ridiculed.  And i am a bit upset when cool people ask me questions about Tolkien or Lewis as if it were suddenly valid because there's a movie coming out soon.<br/><br/>But everyone has a genuine reaction.  Everyone has a passion.  And i don't feel like i can afford to distrust someone just because i'm afraid of their image.  I have to compare their history to mine, i have to get to know them as an individual.  I have to celebrate when they come to my gaming table through D&amp;D or PBR.  I'm doing my best to interact with people based on personal encounter.  Yeah, seeing a hipster wear a G.I.Joe shirt ironically makes me wish i could wear an Arcade Fire shirt ironically, but i don't want to be that person.  I'd rather not get offended, and wonder instead what that persons actual interests are.  Because we all have things that make us excited and make us babble on.  Everyone has a genuine reaction, even if that reaction is to learn as much as they can about a stereotype to help them be embraced by that culture.  Even if that's out of uncertainty.<br/><br/>I've met people that are out-right Hipsters, and they've made my life wonderful, even my gaming life.  I've met people that are the incarnation of stereotype, and i've found that i don't need to foster their social normalcy or help them grow in any way.  People are people, one by one, and that's what i have to keep telling myself.  It doesn't matter if the person i'm talking to is wearing skinny jeans or yoga pants or a replica Indiana Jones hat and a fake pewter GL ring.  What matters is the passions between us, new or old, strange or familiar, hard-earned or simply interested.<br/><br/>ed.  - sorry this post was so huge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324446/#Comment_324446" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T11:15:25+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 11:15AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What the hell does doing something ironically even mean exactly?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324453/#Comment_324453" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T11:54:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 11:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I can tell it means doing something for fun or as a joke.<br/><br/>Say a broke college guy find a "World's best dad!" tshirt at a thrift store.

Apart form rare forays to conventions and local gaming events, I experience RPGs primarily as something I do with very close friends, and circumstances have worked out that without a car, branching out is impractical. It was never really a shameful thing for me either. It may have helped that we didn't actually play D&amp;D until 3rd Edition, but we tended to get more blank stares than anything (and someone once saw a Robotech RPG book I was carrying and asked if it was like Speed Racer).<br/><br/>And hipsters were just never, ever a thing in my social sphere. I'm sure there are some around that I could find if I went up to San Franscisco or whatever, but right now to me the word "hipster" basically means "a particular thing people complain about on the internet."<br/><br/>Though there's even more of a disconnect when it comes to anime fandom these days. I started to feel like I was part of an overall scene in the late 90s, but these days anime cons seem like they're full of hyperactive 14-year-olds and anime blogs seem like they're written by people who inhabit a parallel universe where everything I like is not only terrible, but ruining anime as we know it. At least with RPGs I can get into the online communities, which has kept my gaming group from becoming a cargo cult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324576/#Comment_324576" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T09:10:06+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  9:10AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: graypawn</cite>Because, yes, there is something so beautiful and real about a person who wore a Three Wolf Moon shirt before it was a hit joke.

I was just having a conversation last night about this very thing. I think it is very Old-Man-Cowman of me, but I can't help but feel a twinge of resentment / envy for people who get into gaming now. <br/><br/>Kids these days have it so easy! I remember when I had to cut open the stomach of every orc I slew just to scrape together enough to buy iron rations!<br/><br/>something like that. <br/><br/>I also remember what it felt like to be afraid to let people at my school know I played games, the fear of being branded a nerd. You can grow up a gamer now and not have to face those challenges. Which is rad. We need people who haven't been scarred by a childhood of mockery to make sure gaming continues to grow and flourish. Humans spend 5 billion hours / week playing games. The nature of the games we play will have a profound effect on the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324590/#Comment_324590" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T10:44:56+00:00" title="May 15, 2011 10:44AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graypawn articulates my feelings on the matter very well.<br/><br/>I'm somewhat more FORCED to be ecumenical and not get dogmatic, because the growth and health of my business sort of depends on selling hobby stuff (comics and games) to people outside the tribe.<br/><br/>One of things Greypawn hints at but that I haven't seen said in so many words is that some, perhaps a preponderance, of these 'outsiders' coming to our hobbies may in fact be doing so BECAUSE it's becoming more accepted, and the social cost of being associated with it is low enough they can take the chance to try something that previously may have interested them but that would have gotten them ostracized from their peer group a decade ago. I certainly see plenty of this at the shop: 20-something college kids who come to play D&amp;D or Indie RPGs or Board Games with us who say that they never would have/could have in HS because of the stigma and/or the difficulty of getting to know the closed and (quite logically) defensive group who was into that stuff where they went to school.<br/><br/>My approach is to assume that everyone is sincere in their desire to have fun until they prove otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt, and do my best to curate their interest in a way that I hope will give the hobby another sincere patron/fan/participant.<br/><br/>Oh, and on Big Bang Theory, I resisted it for years because of my similar impression. But once you get past that and watch a few episodes, especially one they get their footing after Season 1, you get a really positive portrait of slightly eccentric, sometimes socially-awkward, but very smart and human characters, including pals and gals who like them even if they don't share every interest they have. It's silly and occasionally they use some lazy stereotypes, but as sitcoms go (and all of this is with the caveat that it remains a half-hour network sitcom), it's compassionate and I can almost always find something in any episode that I ID with in a way that's not painful or embarrassing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324606/#Comment_324606" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T13:11:31+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  1:11PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, there is a lot of US GOOD and THEM EVIL going on here.<br/><br/>To be clear, I'm not sure there is such a person as a hipster outside of people imaginations, much less a hipster agenda that involves exploiting anyones 'nerdiness' for their sinister coolness. <br/><br/>If we replaced SUBCULTURE with RACE or ETHNICITY or CULTURE, this threat stops being somewhat amusing.<br/><br/>Moreover, the punch line of this whole thread is a hipster cliche: "I was into Dungeons and Dragons before it was cool."<br/><br/>Oh, the irony.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324612/#Comment_324612" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T14:09:14+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  2:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regardless of whether there are individual hipsters exploiting nerd-cool or not, it seems to me there absolutely is a movement in mainstream culture to acknowledge and accept and (inevitably) co-opt nerdy things that used to be part of their own somewhat-related subcultures.

Wizards of the Coast would be thrilled if D&amp;D became a mainstream phenomenon. It's one of the reasons they sell the new Starter Set in Target. <br/><br/>D&amp;D in the early 80s was a fad. One of the reasons there were 26 million D&amp;D players is because D&amp;D was popular. Many people played it because it was cool.  But most fads don't last and now Wizards estimates that D&amp;D players have dropped to the 6 million range (across all editions with probably less than 15% actively buying RPG materials).<br/><br/>Is doing something because it is cool different than doing something because it is uncool? In the end, I prefer people who are genuine. If someone is genuinely interested in RPGs, regardless of who they are, I say\u2026 let's roll some dice! <br/><br/>Everyone has their own reason for getting into something new. Many people I knew played RPGs because that's what their cooler older siblings or friends or people in summer camp or someone they had a crush on did. Or they saw an ad in a comic book or picked up an RPG because it featured elements or characters from their favorite comics, books, tv shows, or movies that they want more of. Or they watched the D&amp;D cartoon! <br/><br/>Is that any different than becoming curious because you watched an episode of Community?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324717/#Comment_324717" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T08:42:46+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  8:42AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nope, it's not.

One does not have a privileged or valid point of view by merely being a participant in particular social phenomenon.  The reason for this is that any one person's reaction or account of an event, lifecourse, or situation is at best <i>a single</i> data point. For validity, we'd need a few more. Like maybe another twenty or so as a minimum.  <br/><br/>"[T]he people on the inside"? Who's that? Who counts as an insider or a key-informant in the 'gaming scene'? Again, this insider/outsider rhetoric. <br/><br/>One's affects aren't valid merely because they're affects. I'm not in the habit of appealing to mere subjectivism. Moreover, like I wrote earlier, if we were talking about more politically charge identity categories, some of these comments would be pretty bigoted. What I was saying is that the ones who typically are portrayed  as being unfairly judged and excluded, are unfairly judging and excluding. It's a common enough phenomenon; look at Israel and Palestine or Quebec and the flash-point of the hijab and Islam. There are more examples I'm sure. The current one being "nerds" and "hipsters." <br/><br/>Please don't put words in my mouth and please don't tell me about my field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14276/zero-charisma-nerds-and-neo-nerds" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14276/zero-charisma-nerds-and-neo-nerds" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14276/zero-charisma-nerds-and-neo-nerds/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14276%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14276%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
