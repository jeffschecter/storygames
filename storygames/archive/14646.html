Obviously I'll want to see the big sights, like the flooded waterfront areas and the crash site, but I'm also really interested in who the people are, what their lives are like, and what's grown up in the ashes of the old world.<br/><br/>Post-Apocalyptic Seattle Natives - what's your hardhold like (if you live in one)?

After all, they mostly roam solo, scavenging the ruins of Tully's and Starbucks locations, gnawing on old car tires, snoozing along the shoreline. However, trespass one, and you'll feel the whole city shake, as others surge towards you, punishing clubs at the ready.<br/><br/>When you get to post-apoc Seattle, start by making some offerings to the local sasqui. They have trouble opening tough plastic, but absolutely love those little cinnamon biscotti that you find at Tully's. Grab a package, and open it at the feet of one of these hairy oafs. Then back away slowly. Do this a few times, and your good name will spread throughout their telepathic network. Soon, you'll have sasquatch scooping you up and giving you rides, taking you to their Sasquatch King up upon Mt. Rainer, etc. You'll also have a flash army whenever you need one.<br/><br/><br/>The entire <i>Grunge Nouveau</i> scene is pretty interesting. Local necromantic cabals resurrected Kurt Cobain (as well as the guys from Half Japanese, who died during the apocalypse, and some other guys). Strangely, Zombie Cobain's musical stylings are very similar to Living Cobain's stylings, just... weirder. More potent. Somehow eerie and supernatural. Watching a host of zombified punks moshing it up, with the occasional mortal soul amidst them, is a surreal sight to behold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333174/#Comment_333174" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T11:09:51+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 11:09AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 12:53PM by johnzo.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bring your canoe,  because the real action in Seattle is on the water.  The 99 Viaduct is the only part of the old downtown still above the waves.  There's six or seven tribes living on it, a nice confederation of upper-deck farmers and lower-deck tech divers.  Also, the hottest bazaar in town is on that section of I-90 that's still floating.  Access to both of these attractions is by water only.<br/><br/>When you're paddling from the waterfront to the lakes or vice-versa, you've got two choices: you can pack light and portage over Capitol Hill, or pack heavy and go north through Ballard Lake.  You've still got a short portage at the Ballard Falls, unless you go at high tide.  I recommend high tide; you'll make better time, and Ballard is still pretty hot and clicky.<br/><br/>I remember back in the day there was a big hardhold on Mercer Island, but it was too big to defend and eventually it was sacked.  Was good prospecting there for a time,  it's pretty much played out now.  All the well-to-dos with their gasoline and cigarette caches blimped up to Friday Harbor.<br/><br/>Speaking of the San Juans, be careful up there.  You got your I-got-mine crowd with their fortress yachts and island kasbahs, plus you've got all your various I-want-yours: kayak swarms, jetski pirates, the odd ambitious octosquatch.  It's. All. Bad. News.  And whatever you do stay the hell away from the old submarine base out on the peninsula.  Someone mean owns it, but they don't fly a flag or fire warning shots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333176/#Comment_333176" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T11:16:29+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 11:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://raincityguide.com/files/2011/06/fremont-troll.jpg"/><br/><br/>speaking of bridges, obvs the Freemont Troll                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333178/#Comment_333178" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T11:23:57+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 11:23AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2011 5:01AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live in Junctiontown, which is what's left of the West Seattle Secure Zone, which extended all the way to White Center back before the Big Kill. We've got it pretty good - the Duwamish and the bluff to our east, open water on two sides, the old wall to the south. Junctiontown claims all that but it is mostly patrols and showing the flag on the beaches and at what's left of the WSSZ (sound like a local, say "whizz") wall. We're friends with the Harbor Island mob, who are friends with the Boeing mob, which means we are surrounded by nervous little gearhead tech enclaves that have a deep appreciation for baked goods. We have some boats and do a little trading on the bridges, but for the most part a boat means trouble to us. The necros we do not truck with; they basically caused this shit and being pals with them is like whipping yourself with your own noose. They get fucking bullets if they stumble over the canal. We have problems with the road dogs south of us, hungry gangs of Southcenter Pit motorheads with nothing going for them. We're beefing up the wall and co-opting them slowly, slowly, turning them on each other like the hyenas they are. Further afield I do not know; across the bay we can see lights from Magnolia most nights but if you put a spyglass to it they are not torches but burning bodies, some dead some not.<br/><br/>You're welcome to come and visit! We like visitors with pure intentions. The only thing to remember is that Craig is master here in an absolute and final sense and the Mother Ape is Craig's consort, which you better not comment on,  and you can under no circumstances look either of them in the eye.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333182/#Comment_333182" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T11:34:48+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 11:34AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 12:37PM by mease19.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After the apocalypse, everything was scarce.

Good coffee, vacuum-sealed in foil pouches from before things went bottoms up.  There are only rumors at this point but some coffee has made it this far North.  You might inquire over in Pike Place, don't let the bodies dissuade you - they hang them up to scare the looters.  I hear you can get coffee at the market there.  Who is Sumatra?

Not all the natives will warn you about this: and it's not just because they're all assholes, it's because they assume everybody knows to seek shelter when the clouds start to lighten.<br/><br/>The Cult of the Siren's good to go to if you need something to drink or eat and have a bit of spare jingle, but the locals all look down on them, for reasons I've never had satisfactorily explained to me. Not the worst group I've had to deal with by a long shot, although I only understood, like, half of anything they said to me: some weird secret language or something?<br/><br/>The tall metal structure intrigued me, but I'm a little afraid of heights: no way was I climbing those makeshift ladders and cables, no matter how good a lay of the land it might offer.

People do sometimes walk out, looking none the worse for wear, and they seem fine, for days or weeks or months.  They never say what they saw in there, and they never bring anything back what they didn't take in with 'em.  Sometimes they go back in, and come out, more than once.  But they're never quite right in the head.  Sometimes they snap, and kill their families, then themselves.  Sometimes they lose the will to live.  Sometimes they... just... wander off.  Once heard of someone who completely forgot who they were, their family, their friends.  Found 'em a thousand miles away, claiming to be someone else.  <br/><br/>Other folks get found later, dead in the woods, not a scratch on 'em.  Or sometimes they wash up from the Sound.  Sometimes they, or parts of 'em at least, wash up on the shore in Bee Cee.  <br/><br/>But mostly they just vanish.<br/><br/>S'posedly whose who open up to the maelstrom nearby get more out of it, like more juice or somethin'.  They keep doing that, though, they eventually go wrong in the head too.  <br/><br/>No one knows why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333275/#Comment_333275" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T19:26:52+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  7:26PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 7:27PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, that Southcenter Pit, what used to be most of old Tukwila... there's good stuff can be found in there, for those who can climb down in and back out.
