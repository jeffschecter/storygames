We had a blast, but we (especially myself) were a bit unclear on how Contempt should be taken. From the book I understand it represents the tensions within the community. The example states that if someone starts a project that you don't agree with, you take a piece of Contempt. This I fully understand.<br/><br/>My question is, is Contempt supposed to come only from within the fiction and its events, or should it also represent player-level disagreements and such? I will give you two examples from our previous game:<br/><br/>1) Whenever I 'Held a discussion', one of the players never said anything one way or another (his comment was basically "Mmm..."). This frustrated me, as the whole idea of holding a discussion is for people to voice their opinion on the matter. I felt he didn't play by the game's rules. Then again, there could be a person or persons within the community that would refuse to comment on a discussion, so I kind of understand his way of playing and then indeed it would be reasonable for me to take a piece of Contempt. Which I did, by the way.<br/><br/>2) We were working towards a big, multi-project goal. Then one player just 'Discovered something new' that made all the past projects useless. The thing he discovered was completely from the outside, no human could affect whether it happened or not. I didn't like the way he 'shortcutted' into ruining all our plans in one turn (I wouldn't have minded if he would've sabotaged the projects and used the game mechanics more). Should I have taken a piece of Contempt for this? It wasn't tension from the community's disagreements, it was a natural disaster that, in the fiction, no-one could've prevented. I didn't take a piece of Contempt for this, as my disagreement was with the player's decision. It wasn't something that raised tension within the community (which, I understand, Contempt is supposed to represent).<br/><br/>What's your call?

The fact that the player not contributing to conversations annoyed you as a player is relevant, too, but only because (as you mentioned) it so aptly mimics the same sort of frustration that members of the community would have when their peers were unwilling to engage with them. The game is specifically constructed in order to create those sort of parallels, and it it is often very fruitful to nurture that sort of player/community empathy in yourself while playing.<br/><br/>The second example seems like a table-level issue; in fact, the rules specifically caution against using 'Discover Something New' to sidestep or override established scarcities/issues in the community. (Though the example given is of finding easy solutions, the same logic applies to discovering things that render efforts arbitrarily obsolete or worthless.) If it came up again with the player I would probably bring it up as a player-level conversation, either at the time (if it seemed particularly disruptive) or after the game was over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/modsr" title="modsr"><img alt="modsr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/modsr">modsr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423519/#Comment_423519" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-30T05:00:34+00:00" title="October 30, 2013  5:00AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, very quick and helpful replies!

If someone introduces something that would ruin the game for you as a player, it's okay to stop and say, "Time out. I'd like to avoid putting [aliens/rape/zombies/whatever] in the game. It'd make me less excited about playing."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423539/#Comment_423539" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-30T12:56:20+00:00" title="October 30, 2013 12:56PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh...
