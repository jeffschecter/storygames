I'm new to story games, but my name is David Schirduan. You can check out my games <a href="http://schirduans.com/david/my-creations" rel="nofollow">here</a>. One of my games, Welcome Minions, has a simpler version of a mechanic that I've been working on for about 6-7 months now. I've got some solid ideas, but there's a problem:<br/><br/>The mechanic focuses on drawing and placing cards, whose values can shift and change your character as you play though a fight or scene. <br/><br/>Quick example: your character sheet has 3 slots: Attack, Defense, Speed. When you draw a card from the deck (normal playing cards) you MUST place one down on top of a slot, changing the value of that stat. This provides an interesting choice for players, and every turn requires a bit of strategy. "Do I want to place this low card on speed or defense? Should the high card go in attack?"<br/><br/>But here's my question: a lot of rpgs don't really mess with the consistency and growth of your character. If your character is a ranger, then they have high speed. That's the point. How can I give players a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment in their character even if their stats are constantly shifting? Or should I? Would people want to play a game where their strength can fail in the middle of a battle?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439696/#Comment_439696" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-26T15:22:33+00:00" title="October 26, 2014  3:22PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2014 3:44PM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stats do fluctuate in real life<sup><small>TM</small></sup>.  Typically they go up when you push them to their limits repeatedly, and down when you stop using them for a period of time.  To a lesser degree, stats fluctuate a bit whenever you have a good day or a bad day.  These fluctuations make perfect sense to anyone who has ever lived in a human body or attempted to master more than one skill.<br/><br/>But (here's my 2 cents): Drastically shifting from a high stat to a low stat, just because?  That would require some serious fictizing (explaining the mechanic fictionally or covering the mechanic with a fictional veneer)... or else it stops feeling like "my character" and starts to feel more like "my hand of cards this round".  Which is a game, maybe even a good one, but less like roleplaying and more like strategy.<br/><br/>An example of fictizing that might cover such a mechanic: perhaps our bodies are made of nanobots and the nanobots don't always go where we want them to go.  Or perhaps we are in a dream state and the dream state doesn't always present a consistent reality.  etc.  Even still, not being able to depend on a stat makes me wonder just what *is* stable about my character's capabilities, anything?<br/><br/>There's a conversation up here, several months old, in which we discussed a game with turn-based card-draw mechanics not unlike this.  It can work.  But personally I wouldn't consider them "stats" since I feel stats are definitional, not transitory.  I would consider them more like <i>situational conditions;</i> constantly changing.  I'll find the link and post it here.<br/><br/>ETA: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19570/card-based-task-scene-resolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19570/card-based-task-scene-resolution</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan" title="DavidSchirduan"><img alt="DavidSchirduan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan">DavidSchirduan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439697/#Comment_439697" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-26T15:55:08+00:00" title="October 26, 2014  3:55PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks! here was my fictionalizing:<br/><br/>We are all made of energy. This energy fluctuates throughout our day and our lives. But some people have MORE energy than others. You've met these people. They just seem to burn with life, and with passion. However, while these people have more energy, their fluctuations are more extreme. <br/><br/>This happens all the time. A politician is all over the news, and getting some amazing work done, but next year is not heard from. An inventor creates some amazing devices for a while, but then burns out. A pro sportsman is on the top of his game, but things wind down (and not just because of physical age).<br/><br/>You will be playing as one of these people, and your job is to maximize the high times, and minimize the low times."<br/><br/>As for stability, different classes will have special abilities that also come with card slots, and can shift, etc. So different classes will have different potential, but that fluctuates as well. <br/><br/>It needs a lot of work, obviously. The experience I want to focus on is the anticipation of drawing a card, placing it, and deciding on a strategy that makes the most sense from that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L" title="Patrick_L"><img alt="Patrick_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/999/nLXZTS67FSGIK.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L">Patrick_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439788/#Comment_439788" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-29T20:51:36+00:00" title="October 29, 2014  8:51PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2014 8:54PM by Patrick_L.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey David, I see where you are coming from and I like the thought of holding or swapping stat cards.<br/><br/>I think a possible way to make characters feel consistent while still keeping the card swap mechanic is as follows. <br/><br/>Treat the 3 stored cards (offense, defense and speed) as "success or Effort values", (I can't think of a better name for them). This mechanic would work similarly to dice rolling in a game like DnD.<br/><br/>I think the best way to explain this is by example.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s say we have a character named James. Currently James has in his possession...<br/><br/>Offense = 5 of Clubs<br/>Defense = 10 of Diamonds<br/>Speed = 4 of Hearts<br/><br/>James needs to make a long jump over a chasm to get away from the monster chasing him. <br/><br/>Upon needing to overcome an obstacle, James\u2019 Player draws a card, the 7 of clubs. <br/><br/>Since this is a Speed challenge he has the choice to store that 7 he just drew, and use his 4 of hearts on the obstacle, or use the 7 and keep his 4.<br/><br/>This allows for the player to have a more control over his character\u2019s success.<br/><br/>Character diversity can also be added be having base values for each of the stats.<br/><br/>Ex. James is a Ranger so he has a base speed of 5. When overcoming a speed obstacle add the base to the card value, Base 5 plus 4 of hearts, would give him a value of 9 to jump the chasm. [This method may work out best if you remove face cards from the deck]<br/><br/>Another possibility would be to give specific classes, bonuses with specific suits. I did this with a game I released earlier this month. You can find it <a href="http://mttjourney.blogspot.ca/2014/10/48-hour-rpg-what-i-learned.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, if you are interested, you can check it out, it may give you some ideas.<br/><br/>Having some form of consistent characteristic will make each character for more unique and meaningful, these are just two possible ideas, I am sure you will find one that works even better<br/><br/>I hope this helped!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439811/#Comment_439811" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-30T14:58:25+00:00" title="October 30, 2014  2:58PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it is fictionally important to the player that their character is fast, won't they consistently put their highest cards in Speed?  This seems like it might be a theoretical problem that doesn't happen in actual play.  Have you observed this being a problem in playtest?<br/><br/>You're thinking of these fluctuating values as changing attirbutes, but they sound more similar to the die rolls you get in conventional RPGs.  Sure, my barbarian is strong in general, but that only gives me a +4 to the d20 roll.  On a roll of a 1, I wind up weaker than the party wizard (who rolled a 7 and added his -1 modifier to the result).  The difference is that you're giving the player some meaningful choice along with the randomness.  Simply changing your theoretical framework for what the values mean might remove much of the difficulty.<br/><br/>If it is a genuine problem, then you could easily fix it in a couple ways.  One is to give a static stat value in addition to the cards.  This value might add to the cards played on that attribute (+1 or +2 might be enough to make a real difference).  Or you could use the static value as a minimum threshold: you take the static value or the card's value, whichever is higher.  So if I have a Speed of 4, then I could safely dump a 2 into Speed to trash low value cards.  Or I could place a 10 there if it is really necessary to go first right now and my 4 won't be enough.  <br/><br/>Or you simply have other outside benefits for having a given attribute be your highest value.  A ranger might take a feat/advantage/bonus that lets them catch arrows out of the air when their Speed is their highest card.  Or do amazing kung fu running up walls or dodge some attacks or whatever other benefit seems appropriate.    A ranger or rogue type would have mainly bonuses if they have high Speed or Offense cards, while a barbarian or paladin type might have a mixture of Offense and Defensive bonuses.  Some character types might have a mixture of of all three.  The nice thing here is that it entices the player to put their high cards in a fictionally appropriate way, but still leaves the choice up to the player (and random draw).  Right now, is it better to put your high card in Defense and survive, or put it in Speed and activate your bonus special maneuver?  That depends on how close to death you are... and what your special maneuver does to help you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan" title="DavidSchirduan"><img alt="DavidSchirduan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan">DavidSchirduan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439965/#Comment_439965" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T20:44:04+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  8:44PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            wow! Thank you all so much! I've been using your input (even though I haven't responded) because I had a spur-of-the-moment playtest that went so incredibly well that I've been writing and iterating like a madman! Long Story Short, here's what I've got:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yax_fDbPNgaIxHK4H8q3_F6Tj9Mb4qsQyG1dv1BXLmw/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yax_fDbPNgaIxHK4H8q3_F6Tj9Mb4qsQyG1dv1BXLmw/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>Every stat is a card slot, and when the value of that slot is used (roll against it to attck, or dodge) then the card is swapped out for another one. I added an element of skills being tied to suits, with more powerful abilities requiring more suits. Thus the players have to choose between putting high value cards on their slots, or trying to keep lower value cards that grant them stronger suit abilities. <br/><br/>so far, things have been a TON of fun, and I'm still tweaking and adapting for a broader audience. Please feel free to skim what I've got, and see what your advice and guidance has wrought. In a few more days, I'll post the playtest-ready document to the main storyboard game as a "look at this thing here" type of post.<br/><br/>Thank you again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
