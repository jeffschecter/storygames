We're now entering a new chapter of the story, and I'm hoping to tap the Story Games think tank for some good ideas!<br/><br/>The characters are about to enter Seattle, WA for the first time, roughly a week after the "African rabies" epidemic broke out, resulting in riots of flesh-eating ghouls.   <br/><br/>Essentially I'm looking for two things from this thread: <br/><br/>1) What state would the city would be in after seven days of cannibalistic riots, military intervention, disease control measures, evacuation, and general chaos?   I'm imagining some parts of the city being "secured" while others are rampant with the dead or otherwise dangerous (block-wide infernos, kill zones of demolished buildings, etc.)<br/><br/>2) Having only visited Seattle once, I'm hoping others here can make suggestions of important or interesting locations to work into play.  The Seattle Underground comes to mind, as does Pike Market and the Space Needle.

I'm visiting Seattle (well, Redmond, actually) this week. Though I don't know the area too well, I do know this. When the shit goes down and the flesh-eaters come for me, I'm going to Harbor Island. Several points of access along the southern perimeter, but it's small, so it's easier to patrol.<br/><br/>Plan B, Mercer Island. 90 cuts through the northern end, and it's a big piece of real estate, making it much harder to secure and defend.<br/><br/>Plan C, Bainbridge Island. First order of business: take out the 305 bridge access. Barbed wire and a mounted fifty-cal. The 305 is the only way on or off the island, short of the ferry. This one is a job for a small army, frankly, given the amount of real estate involved. Heavy casualties will be sustained.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>1) What state would the city would be in after seven days of cannibalistic riots, military intervention, disease control measures, evacuation, and general chaos?</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, I don't know the area that well, so here's some bogus speculation:<br/><br/>It would be gray and rainy. The streets would run brown with coffee. Zombies would be biking and hiking around, causing all kinds of mayhem.<br/><br/>Well, okay. Traffic on the 5, 9, and 90 would be murderous. Cars backed up forever. Looting and shooting. A few would take to the water. There would be some outbreaks aboard a few of these vessels, which would then conveniently lose control collide with other ships. Traffic jam all up Puget Sound as people tried to get north to open water.<br/><br/>EDIT: Cross-posted with Jason M.

Any ideas you have would be much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI love Seattle.  I live here, it rocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about Seattle is that its heavily broken into neighborhoods.  And all of them seem about a 15-20 minute drive from one another, no matter if they're side-by-side or across town.  The transit and roads all seem to level everything timewise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe two main highways run nearly parallel to one another on either side of Seattle.  <br/>\nI405 on the eastern side, which runs mostly along the eastern side of the city cutting between Capital Hill and other neighborhoods.<br/>\n99 on the western side, which runs along the waterfront of Elliot Bay (where I work) then cuts North Easterly as you get to the northern edge of downtown.  <br/>\n<br/>\n520 and 90 move perpendicular off I405 heading across Lake Washington toward all the meaty software companies like Microsoft.  Amazon's also right on the eastern side of the city (above chinatown neighborhood) beside I405.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the big important arteries...<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that the neat thing about Seattle is that it used to be a big hill that moved down to the waterfront.  They clearcut and moved all the earth from the slope making a bigger hill on the eastern side of I405 to sure up the land that is Pioneer Square - which is where the Underground old city is.  Everything slowly slopes to the waterfront...  Lots of one-way streets.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeighborhoods I'd look into if I were you that haven't been mentioned:   Freemont (the Troll and other neat neat stuff),  Ballard,  Magnolia (Discovery Park &amp; Fort Lawton military reserve),  Capitol Hill,  Northgate,  even down south as far as Kent perhaps.  And then all the east side locations like Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond, Renton.<br/>\nSmith Tower is another very cool building to look into - it was the tallest building in the western US for a long long time.  There's a neat parking garage across the street from it... looks like the bow of a ship sinking into the ground (care of the underground city).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother odd fact - Seattle is CLEAN... compared to many citites, especially east coast cities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ask more specific questions myself and a few others that live here that frequent this forum might be able to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also suggest contacting the Seattle Chamber of Commerce - have them send you maps and such.  I've also contacted hotels in cities like this before... tell them you're thinking of coming on a company trip and have them send you Seattle info.  Lastly - alot of the schools have their Student Affairs dept that has alot of this info.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that helps a little<br/>\nI gotta go to class!<br/>\n-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145203/#Comment_145203" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T18:19:04+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  6:19PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's <a href="http://www.portseattle.org/about/maps/harbormain.shtml" rel="nofollow">maps of the three main harbor areas</a> from the Seattle Port Authority.  The Port of Seattle is a REALLY big deal.  Biggest US port on the West Coast, I suspect, doing a ridiculous amount of traffic from China, Japan, and the rest of Asia.  Massive container ships coming and going all the time. <br/><br/>In case it matters, I know from personal experience that a freighter to Japan takes about 12 days, give or take, depending on the size of your ship.  Nowadays most freighters are crewed almost entirely by South Asians (Indian, mostly), with a few young officers on board to keep the flag of whatever their "home port" is.  Sometimes ships are licensed out of really random places, minor Caribbean and Pacific island nations, because that means they can do whatever they want.  There would be room for a huge number of people on a freighter, but there wouldn't really be much room for them to sleep below decks, since they normally haul cargo and have crews of 50 people or so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145264/#Comment_145264" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T06:51:29+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  6:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2008 6:52AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny, half our PCs are Filipino or from Indonesia, service staff from a doomed cruise ship.

How long does society hold on as things come apart at the seems?  How long would folks keep trying to go to work, and when would the mass evacuations and martial law begin?<br/><br/>So if you guys were playing in this game, what scenes or situations would you want to see?  What would the most interesting conflicts be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145276/#Comment_145276" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T07:41:27+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  7:41AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it is reasonable to assume no middle period, actually - the outbreak multiplies geometrically, so it goes from a minor nuisance to a wasteland effectively overnight.

It's difficult to explain. Pathology is in the basement, as are the animal labs, which are NOT on any map and you have to have special codes to find let alone enter (we get a lot of protesters).
