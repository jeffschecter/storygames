Our channel features lively panel discussions on play and design, as well as demos of exciting RPGs and actual play videos of pick-up games that we host once a month.<br/><br/>We set a goal of 250 subscribers by the end of the year, and we're so close to hitting our number that we are giving everyone a special holiday gift. It's the Indie+ Anthology, a digital download of supplements for the kinds of games we love. If you help us exceed our goal, we can <b>level up</b>. At 300 subscribers, Quinn Murphy will make a system agnostic game supplement that I'm desperate to read. At 350, Shoshanna Kessock will make a mini-LARP! If we blow past that, we have plans for even more!<br/><br/>Please, if you're not already subscribed, head over to the video linked above and join us. If you already ARE a subscriber, thanks! Share with your buddies and help us out, too!<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Rich                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
