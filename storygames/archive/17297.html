When someone works hard to make it happen, or when the right set of circumstances naturally occur, things pass into or out of our world.  Sometimes these things are amazing.  Sometimes terrifying.  When smart things come through, we call them fairies after the old stories. <br/><br/>This place provides a bounty of food that we can freely gather and hunt.  But when winter comes, the only source safe and fresh food from off our little farmstead are the fish in the cave.  So we devote the better part of our time to gathering and putting up food as well as creating vessels and supplies needed for the job.<br/><br/>When we're on-track for survival and have more than we need down cellar, we dance, paint, swim and play with the local spirits using Granny's potions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392247/#Comment_392247" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T12:14:41+00:00" title="October  3, 2012 12:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The underground lake is reached by taking a torturous winding passage downward. Our young folk treat it like a rite of passage to go there alone. Swimming the nightdark cavern, lit only by the shining of the mushrooms that cling to the walls. It is rumored that if you swim deep enough, you reach a tunnel carved by the ancients that leads to a chamber of the quiet dead. The last person who tried to reach it was a young woman, our strongest swimmer, who was plagued by dreams of an ancestor calling her to find the chamber. She made the attempt, but was never seen again. <br/><br/>The people who live here spend much of their time weaving. The bark of the trees, when pounded, makes long stringy tough fibers that can be used for everything from baskets to springy hammocks that everyone sleeps in. Some of the fungi can be boiled down for dye. The finest fibers are dyed brilliant shades of purple, green and red then woven into long flowing garments that are prized in all seven of the green lands. <br/><br/>The shelter between the forest glade and the cave opening is meant for young seekers. When they find their time has come to learn their adult name, they stay in the hut apart, waiting for a dream vision. When they have had a sign, that is when they travel through the depths of the caverns, taking their first adult journey into the depths of mother stone, and return with their name.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392248/#Comment_392248" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T12:15:57+00:00" title="October  3, 2012 12:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2012 12:17PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I unwind with golf. <br/><br/>The main chore is restocking the vending machines.<br/><br/>It's wondrous because so many tourists visit.<br/><br/>It's dangerous because I might fall in love with a tourist who's already married and really bored with their spouse's golf and hangs around the place looking for someone to have an affair with, and when the spouse gets back from golf they have a whole bag full of weapons ready to chase me with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392262/#Comment_392262" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T14:24:22+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  2:24PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The place is a lucid dreamscape inside my own head.  <br/><br/>Sometimes, when the conditions are right, other dreamers can visit me, or I them.

I only have to open the door of my ramshackle hut, and there is a goat, its leg caught in the middle of a rotten log pile. I fetch my knife and make short work of it. Little twigs and branches sit in an untidy pile beneath my window, as if suggesting that I should make a fire and pull up next to it. So I do. My entire life is this easy.<br/><br/>But there are a few questions that... well, the spirits aren't unflappable. I have made them angry before. My life suddenly becomes very difficult and complicated when the spirits are angry. I find nothing edible, I hear no animals. I don't even know how to set a trap or mend a roof, either - the spirits usually do that for me. They stay angry for weeks at a time, and I almost starve to death when it happens.<br/><br/>That's where the caverns come in. I am terrified of them, but they're my only hope when the spirits are angry. The glade goes dry, and I need to climb down into the caverns to find a source of water. The caverns are full of howling, and crying, and stories that are incomplete. I get in and out as fast as I can.<br/><br/>While the spirits are angry, I spend all of my time struggling to find even basic sustenance and to do even basic repairs. After a while, though, they always seem to forgive me. And everything comes easily again. And so I can spend my time walking in tranquil forests, sitting by cozy fires, wishing, thinking, wondering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392303/#Comment_392303" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T20:46:51+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  8:46PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're right about the Exchange not necessarily having been designed with habitation in mind. The scale of everything is a little off, the steps are too tall but the ceilings are a little too low, and the robots have an imperfect understanding of human speech, no matter which language I speak to them in. <br/><br/>I do my best to make sure they're in working order; they're temperamental and cranky, and particularly testy when you use parts from a different model to repair them. I've been hurt pretty badly exactly three times now when I've fixed up the Crankers, but since they keep the pumps going, it needs must be done. It's actually a marvelously elegant system: the Exchange pumps the abundant water up from the deep cavern and sends back the air that's in such ample supply up here but so scarce down there. I like to think that there's little bits of dark moss actually popping up between those anaerobic glowing fungi. The Rules say I can't open the hatch at the bottom of the Exchange, but the Survey reports are so extensive and I've scanned them so many times it feels like a place I went on some old vacation in my youth.<br/><br/>The Rules also say that I can't open the Atrium doors into the glade, but it's nice to just sit out there and listen to the little waterfall and the stream going over the rocks. Sometimes there's some sort of commotion out beyond the ridge, but the Buzzers lift off through the roof and go calm it down. I try to savor the way they glint in the sun when they take off because I know it means back to work, cleaning them and fixing them back up when they make it home.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392351/#Comment_392351" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T11:57:28+00:00" title="October  4, 2012 11:57AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A.
