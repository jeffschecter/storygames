When I was in college I started running mystery role play games. The players were Holmes and Watson and I ran everyone else they talked to. We used an area map and it took an hour to walk from one place to the next. An interview took an hour. We kept track of time so they could see they had to think about what to do rather than flit from person to person. We acted out each conversation. I answered their questions and showed the body language and tone of voice of each person to give additional information. When they had enough clues they made an arrest and the game ended.<br/><br/>This was a VERY GM intensive game and I realized that only people totally into role playing and diving into a character would want to play so I never wrote it up as a set of rules. It was my tour de force. <br/><br/>[Edit] In these games I knew all of what had happened at the start of the game. I revealed this knowledge to the players through the conversation of investigation. Kind of like a role play twenty questions game.<br/><br/>Matrix Games were a major step away from this approach because you just made up stories about what happened and you could make anything happen. Not so much investigation as creative writing. Now I'm doing the same thing with Action cards. It is still a Matrix game but it can be picked up and run by pretty much anyone. <br/><br/>[Edit] In these games no one knows up front what has happened or who is guilty. Players make up clues in the little stories they tell and they slowly point the finger at one character. Kind of the exact opposite of the role played investigation. <br/><br/>I know there are a lot of games out there. Can you name them and say how they do what they do? <br/><br/>Chris Engle                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423748/#Comment_423748" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T05:36:00+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  5:36AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you specifically interested in Sherlock Holmes games, or in mystery investigation games in general?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423752/#Comment_423752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T06:14:20+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  6:14AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking Sherlock Holmes for now.

We wrote up what happened in pairs. ten we wrote up all the clues, including any red herrings. Each went on an index card. IIRC, it was important to have stuff that conflicted with the red herrings, maybe? A way to discount them, anyway. I forget exactly how many cards we were supposed to make.<br/><br/>Anyway, we then wrote up the set up for the mystery. The class got together ( it was a small class), we shuffled up the cards and dealt them around, then read out our mystery set up.<br/><br/>The rest of the time was people using what clues they had on the cards to form a theory about whodunit. Of course, some clues conflicted ( representing those lines of inquiry that clear suspects- alibis and such), then the group collectively or individually offered their solution. If it was wrong, I recall we ( the writers of the mystery) told them they were off (?). Anyway, someone eventually pieced it together each time.<br/><br/>Sorry if that's vague. It was thirty years ago!<br/><br/>Our mystery turned out not to be too difficult. The Special Effects guy from the Lucas Films studio dunnit. Apparently our classmates guessed less based on our clues and more on my buddy's and my interest in Star Wars films.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423756/#Comment_423756" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T07:48:42+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  7:48AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm rather shocked that there isn't already a GUMSHOE game for Sherlock Holmes; the system is a perfect fit as it stands.

You could also alternately mess with the roles of players--use some rules mechanism to ensure that the Holmes player isn't able to cover all the necessary ground himself, and give Lestrade and the others their own specialized abilities.<br/><br/>You might even have a game where most of the players go out on missions to recover evidence, Holmes examines crime scenes for evidence, and you all come back together to puzzle it out.<br/><br/>Alternately, it'd be a simple enough matter to hack together a Holmes-era GUMSHOE game, I suspect. I'm considering that there might be some merit to a more general game where Holmes' penchant for finding evidence and drawing conclusions is a cherry for having an appropriate general ability (maybe Detection?) at 8+. Maybe something like "once per mystery, receive a core clue for free". I'm a bit more inclined towards this approach, because it hews better to GUMSHOE default. The other approach seems more suited to a build-from-scratch game.<br/><br/>(I'd also want to revamp the approach to core clues and such, more of a "ballistics model", where the commission of a crime ripples outward, producing evidence that can be followed back to the source.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423761/#Comment_423761" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T08:59:05+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  8:59AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What's the conflict in Holmes?</blockquote>\nSolving the mystery?

A story game might work in a similar sense: Sherlock will, of course, solve the crime. Sherlock would therefore best be a kind of GM. The other players then, are the Bakerstreet boys. They are trying to prove that they too can be great detectives and attempt to solve the crime or riddles that Sherlock lays out for them. <br/><br/>The GM playing an arrogant all-knowing Sherlock would be a wonderful front to feed off each other to build the story. As players present there hypotheses, Sherlock could try them with little pushes like "Aaaah, well observed, but even Ms Hudson would have made that deduction! But did you not notice something odd about his hands?". <br/><br/>Feeding little bits of information in the form of "tests" can feed the interaction and cooperative storytelling. <br/><br/>For a more tension fueled game, you could have a two-player stand off between Holmes and Moriarty, each explaining how they foiled and outsmarted the others previous plan in a game of mental chess.<br/><br/>Such great source material <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423793/#Comment_423793" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T15:08:23+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  3:08PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first post of the thread reminded me of that board game as well.

Other PCs may bring clues to Holmes's attention. He may also bring them to his own attention before ratiocinating them into a faintly ludicrous yet correct solution. <br/><br/>A suitable central question of the game, therefore, might be not "Will we solve the mystery?" but "What am I prepared to risk to bring the culprit to justice?"<br/><br/><br/>E.g. To find out the identity of the Haringey Pot-Smasher, you could make discreet inquiries at a boarding-house of ill repute in the Limehouse rookeries. If your disguise should be penetrated, your reputation will surely be seriously tarnished once word spreads that you frequent such places. So maybe better not to go... <br/><br/>Astonishingly, the killer turned out to be Lord Wainscoting himself! Will you risk life and limb to jump aboard the Dover express as it roars out of the tunnel below you in order to apprehend him? If not, this dastardly fellow who made such hurtful comments about your parlour wallpaper earlier on in the case will escape to a life of luxurious exile on the Cote d'Azur. On the other hand... life and limb. <br/><br/><br/>A countdown could be a useful device for Holmesy scenarios - if you "fail", you may very well know who done it, but he's already got away before you could notify Scotland Yard.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424084/#Comment_424084" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-12T01:39:50+00:00" title="November 12, 2013  1:39AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also dispense facts rather than clues, perhaps, and let the players explain how they know the man seen in the garden must be Hungarian because of a distinctive indentation in his footprints or something. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424088/#Comment_424088" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-12T06:01:02+00:00" title="November 12, 2013  6:01AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd also dispense facts rather than clues, perhaps, and let the players explain how they know the man seen in the garden must be Hungarian because of a distinctive indentation in his footprints or something. <br/></blockquote>\nThat is very Gumshoe like.
