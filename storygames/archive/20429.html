Of course the conversion might be trivial, and they might do the exact same thing you'd do, but what if it's not? The only way to know is to convert the colors yourself, even if that just amounts to running the material through the default Adobe Creative Suite conversions.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if it's a huge hassle because I don't have the tools for some reason, then I guess I could send it as rgb and ask the printer to do it - but that'd be all the more reason to take a careful look at their digital proofs.<br/><br/>But then again, the entire question sounds like something that one would encounter in a very small and casual printing project; it might well be that the stakes are simply so low that one might as well take the risk and see what comes out - fix it next time if there are any issues, as it might be. I could easily imagine a project where a weird RGB conversion would be very unlikely to ruin it, and even if it did, it wouldn't be such a huge issue to redo it altogether.<br/><br/>Therefore, in summation: if it's a serious project, do yourself the favour of going with the best practices - meaning, calibrate your monitor to your satisfaction and color-control the project properly. If it's casual, and particularly if it's not photorealistic (e.g. cartoon-style clear vector graphics), and it's a lot of work to do it right, it might make sense to take the small risk of problems cropping up.<br/><br/>The question sounds to me very much like one that we might ask an airplane pilot: do you <i>really</i> need that preflight check-list? The reason the pilot needs the check-list is not that airplanes are supremely error-prone (they're not), but rather because the entire enterprise has such high stakes that you don't want even a small chance of unnecessary error to occur. If you're just planning to drive the plane into a hangar or something, you probably don't need to take all the precautions involved in flying it to Japan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449357/#Comment_449357" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T13:14:22+00:00" title="November  9, 2015  1:14PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main problem with using RGB colours to start with is that they can often look quite different in print. One colour that looks good on your monitor looks terrible in print (after it's been converted to CMYK), while another that looks kind of barf on the screen actually looks quite palatable in print (this second one is rarer). Red, of course, still looks like red.<br/><br/>If you're not particularly bothered by your colours changing when they go from the screen to print, it should mostly be okay, but you may still have to worry about how light or dark they look. RGB Blue translates to a print colour that is MUCH darker than what you see on the screen, for example. I use RGB colours in art quite a bit, but I also use a limited palette (mostly the default colours from Word2000 actually) and I've had them all printed out so I can compare the differences.<br/><br/>If you are using colour images created by scanning physical artwork, the fact that they are in RGB format won't make much of a difference. They will print pretty much as you see them, since they consist of colours in both the RGB and CMYK spectrums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449361/#Comment_449361" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T15:15:26+00:00" title="November  9, 2015  3:15PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't think of a good reason for using RGB if you have the option to send CMYK to the printer.

Specifically, there are three pretty different technical strategies in representing black and white pictures as digital data: greyscale bitmaps (e.g. a 300 dpi photograph), black and white bitmaps (1200 dpi line art) and vector data (a vectorization of a line art piece, or an emblem created in vector format to begin with). Ideally you'll use the correct format for different types of images, and know how to produce them in high quality and maintain that quality through the vagaries of the workflow. A different issue from the color thing, but similar in some ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449687/#Comment_449687" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T22:14:17+00:00" title="November 21, 2015 10:14PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have encountered the situation where my computer programs and the pdf say that two black areas are the same black, but then the full-colour print product has two different blacks on the page.

For CMYK printing, of course, you would ideally understand both issues; modern layout softwares and such do most of the practical work for you when it comes to e.g. trapping, but if you don't understand the issues, the corner cases may come and bite you in more challenging projects. Johnstone's scenario is particularly a common one, as the distinction between pure black and rich black lies in the grey area between what a hobby self-publisher might be expected to know, and what a professional knows - you can print up several rpg books or whatever, and still ruin a job thoroughly when you stumble upon the nuances of CMYK blacks for the first time.<br/><br/>And yes, you will traditionally want the body text of a print job to be in a solid, single ink (usually black for obvious reasons). In the CMYK context either a grey raster or a combination of several inks basically risks minor fuzziness that affects legibility; this limitation of the CMYK printing technique is much more minor today than it would have been e.g. 50 years ago, as technology improves (both rasters and registration are more reliable today at your average offset printer), but the eye is a finicky beast and anything you want a person to spend potentially hundreds of hours reading should be printed with the sharpest line you possibly can achieve. (In other words, this is about <i>body</i> text - adverts, titling and such minor text snippets are much better candidates for funky multi-ink effects, just like illustrations or anything else you'd normally use color for.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449712/#Comment_449712" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-23T14:52:19+00:00" title="November 23, 2015  2:52PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience you always want to print in CMYK.

Yet, avoid as much as you can using saturated colors, as some of those require special inks that the printer won't be easily able to include unless you provide it as a separate color layer (a "color channel" in Photoshop and other design programs). Convert your work to CMYK when you finish it.<br/><br/>Want to avoid fuzzy letters? Eliminate letters (just the black letters) from all but the K channel. They won't be too dark but they will be perfectly legible. I often had to do this for the small black hand-written letters for the logo of my company on the covers.<br/><br/>In my country, calibrating the screen and adopting a color profile never works, as even if you're lucky the printer uses the same standards there's a high chance the guy sends my stuff to be printed at other place, or perhaps he doesn't uses inks that coincide with the same color profile :P third world country problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449717/#Comment_449717" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-23T20:39:01+00:00" title="November 23, 2015  8:39PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I had a whole cover ruined by a pantone effect on a bit of text. </blockquote>\nDo you mean that you had transparency?
