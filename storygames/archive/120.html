                    Here's part one of the AP from the final, largely-climactic session of a short (4 sessions) TSoY game I was just a part of. You'll have to wait for part 2 for the dire conclusion I hint at, but it's already plenty long, so I figured I'd get what I've got up and do the rest in a day or two.<br/><br/>================<br/><br/>The Background<br/><br/>Kaedor Ulwin is the ruthless leader of Ammeni, the first to ever unite the squabbling Major Houses. Far ahead of his time, he raised the largest army Near has ever known to invade Maldor (Oh, he's also got a dragon). The PCs were originally assorted retainers of the Maldoran Lord of Castle Ursus, until the advance of Ulwin's armies forced them to flee. Seeing the size of his armies, we realized we couldn't effectively lead a fight against Ulwin here in Maldor, and our only hope of killing him and stopping Ammeni's advance would be to work from within Ammeni, stirring up the defeated lords and orchestrating an insurrection.<br/><br/>In the second and third sessions, we convinced the wizard Lord Dvorak to attack Ulwin's capital Empyrion if we could also get the support of Cardinal Bracken (a brain-damaged nitwit nominally in charge of the city of Port Bracken), and directly seized control of Bracken's military forces by getting in his good graces and autodefenestrating* his Grand Vizier, an ardent Ulwin-supporter. <br/><br/>There were roughly Six PCs. Honestly, most of them don't feel particularly important to my experience of the game. The players were all very good at some core gaming techniques, mostly centered around color, but at the same time, they didn't seem to <i>go</i> anywhere, as characters.<br/><br/>David played Svan Dysis, a Three Corners mage focusing on Destruction, Mind Control, and shape-shifting. He was probably one of the most straight-up effective characters from a 'getting stuff done' perspective, but I can't for the life of me figure out why he bothered to come on this decidedly dangerous mission instead of just retreating to some arcane sanctuary in the mountains. His main (only?) key was based on using magic. As far as I can tell, he was just Magicky guy who used magic.<br/><br/>Kris played Federico, an engineer whose family had been killed by Ammeni raiders long ago (Key of Vengeance). He also had Key of Conscience, but after the first couple of scenes of the game, the two never really came into conflict. So he was Hates Ammeni guy off to ruin the Ammeni, and he did. (Now that I think about it, in later sessions he mentioned an interest in ditching his Key of Conscience, which would have some interesting implications, but he never found or made an opportunity to actually do it)<br/><br/>Marc played Quincey, a goblin largely attached to Federico. Another character I never really got much of a sense of, he was just Sneaky Guy who got xp from Stealing And Occasionally Supporting Federico. Those two goals never came into conflict or anything. <br/><br/>Max played Brasil a Khalean ranger with the most direct vendetta against Khaedor. He was 'sort of ' a PC because he started as mostly an NPC, with initial motivations  directed towards killing Kaedor supplied by the GM, and enough assorted other information to get us rolling in that direction. Pretty straightforward vendetta guy.<br/><br/>William played Arterid Lofturne, a young knight, the last of a distinguished old family that had been ruined by the Skyfire. Even aside from his character being strongly connected to mine, I feel that William did actually add some thematic content to the game. Until we crossed Absalon's Way (effectively the point of no return), he was obviously divided about where his duty lay versus what would have the greatest direct chance of bringing down Kaedor's regime.<br/><br/>Finally, I played a ratkin named Whisken Blackfur, a rat who met Arterid while he was exploring the ruins of his family's former manor. We became fast friends (Key of Fraternity) and Whisken came back to Ursus with him. Enough derision for being a rat in a Maldoran court gave him an appreciation and sympathy for the downtrodden (Key of Conscience), but eventually he carved out a place for himself  with the support of Arterid and some judicious ass-kicking.<br/><br/>The Story-guide's name was Jeff.<br/><br/>Whisken didn't change a whole lot in the first three sessions, either. In the last session, though, I really seized the Key system by its throat and took its lunch money. Using it, I not only generated and burned through eight or ten advances in a single session, but I changed the character and his role to such a great extent as to change my interpretation of his entire arc, right back to his beginnings. It was rather breathtaking, actually, until the GM pulled a stunt that was a huge social contract violation at the climax and, from my perspective, largely invalidated most of the game. It left me frustrated and downright angry at him for days, and I'm still not over it.<br/><br/>But I'll get to that <i>after</i> the good stuff.                </div>

<div class="Message">
                            At the beginning of the fourth session, we all split up to make the final preparations for the assault on Empyrion, Ulwin's capital. Svan and Brasil went on a mission to the other two major cities of Ammeni to attempt to get their support; Arterid, Federico and Quincey stayed in Bracken to prepare siege engines and marshall the troops; I rode hard towards Maldor to get the help of the ratkin of the ruined cities. I chose to drop my Key of Fraternity with a sad farewell scene; I was going to need all the advances I could get my hands on. Besides, Whisken was returning to his people, and I knew that he might well never see Art again. I bought up rank 1 in "Tactics" in preparation for leading the rats, and Key of the Mission (Stop the Ammenite armies in Maldor) to fuel me on my journey.<br/>
<br/>
In the previous session, Whisken had tracked down "the wisest-looking Zaru slave" he could find in Port Bracken, convinced the man that he was a friend, and got him to teach Whisken the Secret of Zu. No words other than 'Zu', of course, but it would still prove useful. When Whisken reached the ruined city nearest the Maldoran front, Zu was his gift to the ratkin that lived there, to prove that he was not an Ammenite spy. He said "Zu" at the city's finest climber, to allow him to climb a wall that no rat had yet scaled, and then taught all the ratkin of the city how to use this gift. (I also bought Tactics up to 2 with the last pair of advances I had lying around).<br/>
<br/>
Jeff portrayed the ratkin in a surprising yet sensible manner. I had been differentiating my character from the humans by intentionally using lower-status speech; lots of swearing and colloquialisms. These ratkin, on the other hand, were scrabbly, almost Gollum-like creatures. We interpreted it as reflecting a change that Whisken had undergone in his time at Ursus, making him the outsider even though he was about to become a hero.<br/>
<br/>
The operation against the Ammeni army was fairly straightforward. Any army of tens of thousands needs huge amounts of food. Remove their food supply, and the army will fall into chaos. Whisken would lead all of the ratkin warriors in a diversionary strike on the army, just before dawn, while their thousands of rat friends, with as few ratkin as are necessary to keep them focused, would sneak in behind to the stores, "Eat as much of their food as possible and shit in the rest." The ratkin would continue to use guerilla and skirmish tactics to harry resupply of the army. <br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
Rules digression: Throughout the game, we had been having some trouble rendering complex conflicts involving large numbers of PCs and opponents in a satisfying manner. It made me miss the way that Heroquest effectively lumps all of the relevant narrative elements of the situation into one easy-to-use number. I stand by my assertion that we really had too many players for TSoY to really hum like it should. But there are some things about the conflict system that are just plain beautiful in their elegance.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we decided that equipping the ratkin with Zu would confer an effective bonus die to my Tactics roll to manage the battle. After all, if every single soldier is "Zu"ing his neighbor (or "Uz"ing the opponents, as the battle continued), each soldier would be operating at a bonus die, so it made sense. Now, it would also make sense that trying to manage the fight against an enemy army twice the size of yours would be worth a penalty die (three or more times your size, and you're looking at two penalty dice; that's definitely "Oh, Shit!" territory). An effective, intuitive interpretation, therefore, is that giving your force an advantage that confers a bonus die effectively allows them to take on a force twice their size! Something about that particular flow of intuitive logic is extremely appealing.<br/>
--------<br/>
<br/>
The plan worked wonderfully, I picked up another 5xp for significant progress towards my Mission, and the ratkin reconvened in the city. We dispatched messengers to the other ruined cities of Maldor to teach them Zu and work on their own disruptions against the other wings of the Ammenite armies. Whisken picked two dozen ratkin warriors to accompany him back to Ammeni, and set off with all haste.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from Ammeni, Whisken had been accompanied across the bridge over Absolon's Way by a squad of Bracken soldiers and an Official Message from the Cardinal. That wasn't going to work so well coming back with two dozen ratkin and an intent to blow up the bridge. We ambushed the guards at the bridge, quickly taking them hostage.<br/>
<br/>
Dilemma time! What do we do with these prisoners? (This was an especially strong decision because, in an early scene of the first session, Whisken came to blows with Brasil and Federico in a failed attempt to stop them from torturing and killing an Ammenite prisoner.) If we left them on the Maldor side of the bridge, they could run to warn the armies, maybe getting them to march back on Empyrion. If we left them on the Ammeni side, they could run straight to Empyrion and warn them of an impending siege.<br/>
<br/>
There was no help for it; I had all fifteen of them executed, buying off my Key of Conscience and swapping Zu for Uz. Then I blew up the bridge, grabbed a few xp for it, and dropped my Key of the Mission. I had done everything I could to paralyze and destroy the armies in Maldor; I had to hope it was enough as we moved on to Empyrion.<br/>
<br/>
-------<br/>
Author-stance digression: When I made the decision to execute the prisoners, I wasn't really thinking in terms of my character's larger arc or growth. I had been considering ditching that Key of Conscience for a while (it wasn't really coming up in play), and it was the most sensible course of action to take. At the same time, I had a feeling in the back of my head that this decision was going to be hugely Significant when I looked at it in the broader context of the Whisken's progression. I just didn't have time to do that in the moment. Even so, I really appreciate how the action of buying off that key set down an almost subtextual flag for me to refer back to. ("Subtextual" in that it's not a concrete event in the fiction in and of itself, but it can be pointed to as evidence of the significance of a particular fictional event)<br/>
<br/>
In fact, when I did later go back to look at what we had created, it involved reinterpreting primarily in terms of these flags. Not all of them were from key buyoffs, but every key initial purchase and eventual buyoff figured in.<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
Not only had all of these Key buyoffs given me solid moments for later interpretation, they also directly changed Whisken's role. at the start of the fourth session, he had basically remained a scrappy single fighter with no particular dreams of leadership, but now he was a Master tactician in command of a crack team of ratkin commandos.<br/>
<br/>

                            And now, for the tragic conclusion:<br/><br/>My side-quest wasn't the only thing going on in the first half of the session, however. In the meantime, Svan and Brasil visited the other two major Ammeni cities in an attempt to enlist their aid. Both were very colorful scenes, both literally and technically speaking. The first city was more or less a republic, paralyzed by dozens of self-interested lobbyist groups and an overly parliamentarian parliament (they normally spend about 3/4 of every meeting re-districting the city). The second was little more than a massive nomadic encampment, and the pair beat a very hasty* retreat when they determined pretty conclusively that the local princeling was entirely Ulwin's creature.<br/><br/>For Federico, Quincey, and Arterid, however, there was practically nothing in the first half of a rather long session. At one point Jeff cut to them and asked them what they were up to, but it amounted to little more than a few minutes of downtime summary, training the troops and preparing the siege engines. It's a real shame, too; there was a perfect source of short-term adversity waiting in the wings. That Ulwin-supporting Grand Vizier Svan had throw himself out the window? He hadn't been killed in BDtP. Bringing him back wouldn't have even been a sort of dirty trick. When David said he was making GV hurl himself out the window, Jeff explicitly asked him whether he wanted to permanently end the issue by Bringing Down the Pain, but David didn't want to risk it. When it became clear that nothing was going to come of it, I was a bit disappointed, both because it sounded like a fun subplot, and because it meant that half of the players were basically sitting around with nothing to do for two hours or more.<br/><br/>When all the PCs reconvened at the head of the siege column, Jeff flicked on some music; the soundtrack to <i>Warcraft II</i> made for a pretty cool background, given that that's almost exactly what we were doing. The siege got off to a rocky start. The moment our siege engines emerged from the surrounding forests, they were bombarded by catapults and such from the walls. After Quincey snuck around and found a sewer leading out under one section of the walls (aided by an Engineering supporting roll from Kris, who had Federico give Quincey tips on what to look for in this sort of fortification). The opening was too small for a human... but just right for some ratkin!<br/><br/>That night, Whisken led his squad under the wall to take out the siege equipment. After failing the initial conflict roll with his newly Master level tactics skill (just a tie, fortunately), there was a tense BDtP sequence of Whisken and his rats causing chaos through the city, slipping through back-alleys to avoid attempts to capture them, scattering and reforming the squad to confuse pursuing soldiers, and eventually setting fire to all of the defensive weapons on that side of the city before disappearing back under the wall. This was the scene where all of those advances I gained through the session really hit home; the guards of Empyrion were highly-skilled, and I don't think I could have won without that skill of 3.<br/><br/>With the anti-siege equipment out of the way, the attack began at dawn. Federico's specially-designed siege cannon ("We have several cannons in the army, but only one The Cannon") made quick work of the outer wall, and most of the PCs led the charge to head for the inner keep. They met Kaedor Ulwin and his dragon in the city square and began the final showdown.<br/><br/>I sat this one out. By that point, I had had more spotlight in the session than anyone else. Besides, Whisken had never been too keen on the glorified assassination aspect of the mission, so I felt that his leadership in the siege-weapon raid was a more fitting climactic moment for him.<br/><br/>The battle was hard, make no mistake. If Jeff had been rolling better, the PCs probably would have lost, and the stakes were as high as they get. However, the fact that it was five-on-two (and then five-on-one, after the dragon was taken down) meant that the PCs could pile low-level Harm on Kaedor when he rolled that triple-minus and the penalty dice earned from that kept him from recovering his momentum. It was still pretty close, though; he had the secret that let him pump up his Harm by spending pool points, and he had massive pools. Arterid and at least one other PC were Broken by what would have otherwise been minor wounds, and if the battle had lasted another few rounds and run them out of pool points, they would have been dead. As it was, William still had to burn an advance to bump Arterid's Vigor pool up in order to stay in the fight.<br/><br/>-------------<br/>Rules digression: In the little bit of rules discussion afterward that we could do before I blew up at him, Jeff complained afterwards that, even though he had made Kaedor and the Dragon basically as powerful as it was possible to make characters within the bounds of the system (4 on all relevant skills, huge pools, damage-bumping secrets, etc.), it didn't seem like it was possible for them to win. I can see what he means; after one bad roll on his part early in the fight, the piling of Harm did start to seem pretty inevitable.<br/><br/>This doesn't bother me, either as a player or a prospective Storyguide. The fact that, in a heavily player-driven game, It's not really possible to build something that can stand up to the simultaneous cooperative effort of five PCs who have each had several sessions to develop their relevant skills, sounds about right.<br/>-------------<br/><br/>Then the badness begins. Gah. It's a full week later and it's still really frustrating just to write about it.<br/><br/>Lord Dvorak also participated in the final fight, but was taken out pretty early on. He had a magic hour-glass, which had been introduced before the siege as a sort of last resort item, that could "Give us a second chance if all is lost". Now, for the PCs, rather little was lost, but he lay there dying after the fight, so he activated it. The players didn't want it and tried to conflict it, but Jeff basically GM-forced it into happening.<br/><br/>A couple of minutes of Bizarre short-term-time-travel-gone-wrong narration ensued. Then it got weirder, until each of the PCs woke up in strange chairs with wires plugged into them. Jeff changed the background music from <i>Warcraft II</i> to some sort of electronica, handed out <i>Shadowrun</i> character sheets with the closest approximation of our previous characters on them, and hauled out the <i>Brainscan</i> and <i>Renraku Arcology: Shutdown</i> books out of his bag.<br/><br/><i>Shadowrun!</i><br/><br/>Apparently the entire game had been a VR simulation, and whoever coded that hour-glass hadn't debugged his code properly. Problems were cropping up all around the arcology, and the session ended with us thrust into the beginnings of a Run Away From the Crazy Robots <i>Shadowrun</i> adventure.<br/><br/>I haven't been that angry in a <i>long</i> time. Just as I had really hit my stride in TSoY and really made the Key system into a force for Awesome; just as I had sat back and begun to contemplate Whisken's arc and the implications of his actions; just as the game became something Important to me, rather than just a fun adventure, he pulled this. <br/><br/>To add insult to injury, within five minutes of the switch he made a call for a meaningless task roll, something we had basically run out of town in TSoY (greatly improving the game) by explicitly setting stakes for each conflict.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I'm not going back to the "real" final session tonight.                        </div>

<code>Glancing at the Story-games rules, it occurs to me that this AP thread isn't quite in line with the AP goals here. I did try to include as much of the |Awesome| (that's "Absolute Value of Awesome"; hence, both Awesome and Sucky) parts of the game as possible, with just the minimum amount of awesome-neutral stuff to string it together. I hope it doesn't mess with the zen too much.</code><br/><br/>That's it. <b>You're fucking <i>banned</i>, dude</b>. :-)<br/><br/>Just kidding, it's all good, Actual plays are cool (and Clinton's right, I did skim most of it until the end.

What I wanted to say with that was,<br/><br/>"At the Forge, we feel the need to discuss our actual plays at great length to discuss specific cool points or problem points in our gaming.  Here, though, just feel free to toss us a sentence or a paragraph about something cool or sucky that happened: You don't have to do all that work if you don't want to, just feel free to share a "cool moment" or whatever if you want".  But if you do, that's cool too.<br/><br/>But yeah, I agree with Clinton, and insist: Please create a new thread on this event, it needs to be shared with others (even if it's a simple post with nothing more than a brief description and a link to this post).

                            I want to thank you guys, actually. Just bringing it up and thinking it through again enough to write about it got me really worked up again. I blame most of my need to apologize for something trivial on this state*. But now I have something to laugh about when I think about it, and that does wonders for letting all of the frustration just bleed away.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, the GM was patting himself on the back. I managed to remain civil until a day or two later when he made a livejournal post that was very satisfied about how it went, and about the concept of such a "surprise game," without any acknowledgement of the social contract minefield it involved walking through. That made me get nasty, because I had just recently been pushed on one of the mines.<br/>

                            Ok, moment of fairness that's _not_ tied to bad GM habits - this is also a common problem in writing, where the value of the "twist" is sometimes thought to be worth enough to offset any secondary problems it creates.  And heck - sometimes it is.<br/>
<br/>
And note - one of the benefits of the traditional GM power dynamic is that when the GM _does_ have really spectacular ideas, he's capable of springing surprises on the players that end up being _very_ fun and rewarding for everyone involved. Unfortunately, as his illustrates, when the GM has a crappy idea, it can be an unmitigated disaster.<br/>

                            Rob, <br/><br/>Good points. <br/><br/>However, as for the first I'd have to argue that the twist that works in fiction usually does so because of the audience/creator divide. Take that away and push everyone towards center, as most RPGs do, and the twist becomes less and less likely to work when pushed by a single figure. <br/><br/>(Groups can create twists, of course, they're just less likely to be surprising.) <br/><br/>Also, GMs can do that. It can be cool. In a lot of games individual players can also pull off stuff like that though, so I don't think we have to limit the potential to the GM.                        </div>

Is the GM a friend of yours, or just a guy you game with? <br/>
<br/>
Would there be any benefit at all of trying to communicate to him how profoundly he went wrong?<br/>
<br/>
How do you even begin to approach that?<br/>
<br/>
While I have never been subjected to anything quite this heinous, there have been times I've been so deeply dissatisfied with a friend's GMing that I was at a loss for words. I didn't want to say what I really thought for fear of messing with the friendship or making him think he's irredeemable as a GM.                        </div>

                            OK, repeating comments from another thread:  <br/><br/>I'm more baffled here.  I've game-mastered a handful of sessions where it was revealed that a bunch of what just happened was a dream. I considered accepting such to be toeing the boundary of trust. However, the main direction of the campaign (and mechanics used) was always agreed on openly by everyone.  This has been true pretty broadly.  If I go to a con game listed as Call of Cthulhu, then I damn well expect my Call of Cthulhu -- and if the GM pulls out some other game, I expect even the typical con-goer to be pretty annoyed.  <br/><br/>Out of curiousity: How was the basic game agreed to in the first place? i.e. How did you decide who was GM and what game you would be playing? What I'm wondering at is how it happened that Jeff thought he could change out the system which everyone agreed to.  Would it have made a difference to you if he had switched to a different system: The Pool or Shock, say? <br/><br/>I'd offer a possible contrast:  The last sesion of our Buffy game, the current GM invoked a character-switching on all of us.  (I did an Actual Play thread on the Forge: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18656.0" rel="nofollow"><b>"[Buffy] A little role reversal"</b></a>.)  I knew about that and indeed suggested it, though the other players didn't, but they ran with it happily.  To me, the difference is how much leeway I have in the social contract.  A minor modification is acceptable for a single session.  Any further than that and I expect sign-off.                        </div>

<p>It's worth noting that, while I thought this was absolute crap, not all of the players agreed with me.</p>
<p>Kris didn't like it, but wasn't nearly as angry about it as I was. I don't know whether he went back for the final Shadowrun session.</p>
<p>I don't think that William liked it all that much, but he didn't get involved in any of the discussion, so I can't say for certain.</p>
<p>Max was in on it from the start (he was the one who played a "partial" PC) and wouldn't have even been in the game except for it, largely because he's not so much into fantasy.</p>
<p>I have no idea how Marc felt about it.</p>
<p>David was astonished that I was so upset. His comment was along the lines of, "First you get a cool TSoY game, and now there's a bonus Shadowrun adventure on the end! What's the downside?"</p>
<p>So there is <em>some</em> leeway in why Jeff thought this might be a good idea: he already had one player who was in on it thought it was, and at least one of the other players agreed with him, after the fact.</p>
<p>The Stanford Gaming Society also has something of a culture of experimental games, including ones I've been involved in running. While I don't think there's been any sort of twists quite this dramatic, it's not entirely unprecedented. That said, in just about all of the games with the really big twists, it was made pretty clear that the players were signing up for something mysterious and strange with more going on than they knew (or, in at least one case, signing up for something they knew essentially nothing about, based entirely on the reputation of the GMs/designers).</p>
<p><code>(Brand) However, as for the first I'd have to argue that the twist that works in fiction usually does so because of the audience/creator divide. Take that away and push everyone towards center, as most RPGs do, and the twist becomes less and less likely to work when pushed by a single figure.</code></p>
<p>I think this is pretty key, actually. If most of that last session hadn't been quite so awesome, the stunt wouldn't have hit nearly as hard. <strong>And what was it about the session that made it so awesome? That I finally managed to push for some really strong authorial statements in a sub-plot that was actually important to me.</strong> In other words, we had finally used TSoY for what it's really good at. Am I implying that we had been using it incorrectly up until then? Yup.</p>
<p>If I had to characterize Jeff's GMing style overall, I would probably call it "Enlightened Illusionism". That is, it's the GM's job to present an overall 'Plot', with a well-defined starting point, a well-defined direction to go from that starting point, and a well-defined climax (Ugh, looking at his e-mail, he states that "the use of the hourglass happened to be the single most important event in the campaign". That the 'single most important event' was something only the GM had significant investment in is probably a bad sign). Within the context of the players working towards that climax, however, he is willing to accept player input. My trip to the ratkin city is an example of this. Until I introduced the possibility a session or two earlier, he had never considered it, but was fine with adding it in.</p>
<p>David and Marc's characters, at least, fit into this. They were both effective characters, willing to go along with whatever, and whose only significant Key was basically "Key of Doing That Thing I Do".</p>
<p>I would imagine that this is a great style of GMing for running fantastic Shadowrun games (especially coupled with his skillful evocation of Color), but it interacted somewhat roughly with TSoY. Among other things, it meant that the basic direction of the game ("Mission To Kill Kaedor Ulwin") was set before any of the characters had been made.</p>
<p>For example, three of the six PCs took the Key of Conscience. In the entire four-session game, the GM pushed forwards exactly <em>one</em> situation where KoC came into play, and it was basically a tangential moment at the very beginning, before we had been shown the main direction of the campaign. The only reason the key came up after that for any of us was because I pushed it as an issue in the two scenes that involved prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Also, none of his Key Scenes were particularly Bangy--they were all, in one way or another, just Important scenes that had a particular outcome and no strong element of Choice on the part of the PCs. (Huh. In fact, I just noticed that all of his Key Scenes were session-ending climax scenes, which is probably not how I would choose to use them...)</p>
<p>This didn't stop the game from being any fun. It <em>did</em>, however, stop the game from being Totally Awesome, until I managed to get in my Key Mojo in the last session.</p>
<p>Now, these aren't "System Doesn't Matter" people, but neither are they frequent indie gamers. As far as I can tell, the concept that playing a particular game means a change in "GM style" and basic play procedures didn't really sink in. Most of the "Learning the Game" time for this was focused on standard new-game growing pains like getting used to applying the conflict resolution system, setting explicit stakes, and those sorts of techniques.</p>
<p><code>(jhkim) Out of curiousity: How was the basic game agreed to in the first place? i.e. How did you decide who was GM and what game you would be playing? What I'm wondering at is how it happened that Jeff thought he could change out the system which everyone agreed to. Would it have made a difference to you if he had switched to a different system: The Pool or Shock, say?</code></p>
<p>At some point in November, Jeff was vaguely planning on running a short (4-5) session game sometime during winter quarter, but he didn't have a solid sense of what, and so was taking recommendations from people. Sensing an opportunity to promulgate indie goodness, I started asking more details about what he wanted and eventually suggested TSoY. He sounded interested, so I lent him my copy of the book.</p>
<p>He must have liked what he saw, because he decided to run a game of it. A couple of weeks later, he made an announcement calling for signups on the Stanford Gaming Society forums and e-mail list, coupled with a pretty cool animated flash intro/advertisement. This is basically standard operating procedure for getting a new game going around here (minus the flash intro, which is just a cool thing that he does).</p>
<p>The only piece of text I have that might explicate his point of view was in his reply to my irritated (but civil) initial e-mail, in which he says <em>"I believe that I gave you (and everyone else) a complete and fully canon Shadow of Yesterday game.  I think this fulfilled the obligation which I brought upon myself by advertising 'Wings of Shadow' as being a 'Shadow of Yesterday' game."</em> Why he thinks that this obligation ran out before the formal end of the game is beyond me. I think this statement is as much being instinctively defensive as it is actually thought out, as it's a reply to me being critical of his little stunt mere hours after it happened. (I really shouldn't quote that e-mail too much; Chris would have an absolute field day.)</p>
<p>Conceptually, what angered me the most wasn't so much that it was Shadowrun, but that treating the TSoY part of the game as a dream/VR simulation basically denies the possibility that decisions in that part of the game could have meaningful consequences, even solely in the context of the narrative of the game. It said to me, "No, your character didn't give up his closest personal relationship to save a family who had become strange and alien to him. No, he hasn't become a hero to anybody. No, he hasn't become a leader. No, he didn't sacrifice human life on the altar of military expediency. No, he didn't vastly change the future balance of power in the world by giving the Maldoran ratkin a powerful new weapon and leading them to victory against a human army. No, I decree that he's just been playing a Playstation game."</p>
<p>The fact that it was Shadowrun only mattered in that it is a game I have zero interest in playing. Also, that it appeared to exhibit a very specific negative characteristic (meaningless task rolls) that TSoY allowed us to abolish.</p>
<p>I admit that it's possible that choices made in VR TSoY could potential have meaning in the context of a sci-fi frame, if that frame had a lot to do with VR issues and how non-real experiences can affect real life (Hell, I'd totally play that game of Shock), but those thematic statements would still be radically different from the thematic statements produced from within the context of the TSoY game, and it was the TSoY world that had become Important to me. Furthermore, the ten minutes we spent in Shadowrun at the end of the session gave every indication that it was just a "Run Away From the Crazy Robots" adventure, and not something with more relevant thematic weight.</p>

<p></p><pre><code>(Adam) Is the GM a friend of yours, or just a guy you game with?

<p>We've been friends for about two years now. We're both members of the Stanford Gaming Society, and actually live across the hall from each other in the dorm.</p>
<p>I did try to communicate it, but the fact that I was swearing at the time may have blunted my rhetorical effectiveness, or at least his willingness to really listen to what I was saying rather than instinctively getting defensive. Words of wisdom: "It's dangerous to post when you're grumpy." At this point, I'm honestly not sure how, or if, I can bring the subject up again without it being directly construed as an attack. My basic plan is to drop it, let things cool for a bit longer, and then start interacting with him again in as non-gaming-related a way as I can.</p>

Why didn't you and your friends just say, "Nah, that VR mindtrip doesn't happen. We don't want to play Shadowrun. Let's keep going with The Shadow of Yesterday, cuz that was really fun." Why get mad at all?                        </div>

Shock, for one. The anger was as much a visceral reaction as anything else, though it had plenty of material to feed on afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
As I implied, I am by no means confident that a motion to switch back to TSoY would have even had a majority, let alone been successful. Jeff was heavily invested in his trick and the Shadowrun adventure behind it, Max was only even in the game because of the trick, and at least one other would have said "Screw that, the game was nearly over anyway [this is true], I'd rather do the Shadowrun."                        </div>

                            I think Adam's point is that discussion would have been a good thing to have. You state your case ("Lame! Let's not do the VR thing.") and everyone discusses it. People communicate and then come to some agreement. Doesn't mean you would have liked the outcome, but it would have at least been in the open and talked about, instead of just silent rage.<br/>
<br/>
As a social issue, I think this goes beyond who ultimately gets their way. It's about the willingness among the participants to communicate about the game and respect each other's feelings and thoughts.                        </div>

                            My initial reaction was the same as that of Brand, Andy, Clinton, etc. WTFBBQ?!<br><br>But as I discussed it with my ever-so-wise wife, it became clear to me that this isn't a big deal. <br/><br/>1. GM plays "Dallas"-style VR scene wackiness, probably thinking the players will think it is as cool a mindtrip as he thought it was (or <i>maybe</i> he's just a psycho control freak, but whatever).<br/><br/>2. Players have the initial WTFBBQ? reaction.<br/><br/>3. 10 seconds pass.<br/><br/>4. Players go, "GM-dude, WTFBBQ? This isn't fun. Can we not do this? I want to play TSOY, not SR. MMmmmkay?"<br/><br/>Now, at this point one of four things likely happens:<br/><br/>A. GM says, "Oh, wow. This is embarrassing. I thought it was cool. Okay, we can keep playing TSOY." Players have fun. <br/><br/>B. GM says, "Oh, wow. This is embarrassing. I thought it was cool. I'm really not interested in continuing with TSOY." Players say, "Okay." Maybe one of them starts GMing. Maybe the original GM makes a character; maybe he goes home. Everyone remains friends.<br/><br/>C. GM says, "I planned all this and you hate it! You suck! I refuse to do anything but run the SR mindtrip I created!" Players flee. Maybe you stop gaming with that dude but still hang out with him.<br/><br/>D. GM says, "I planned all this and I'll bet you'd like it if you tried it. Can we try it?" Maybe players say yeah and it works and they have fun. Maybe players try it and it sucks and then they go back to A, B, or C. Maybe players don't try it but life goes on.<br/><br/>What I "get," but want to warn people away from, is any judgment that because the GM pulled a fast one on the group, he's a psychotic raging control freak who should be shot. GMs pull this kind of thing all the time, and some players <i>love it</i>. <br/><br/>If there's nothing in place in the social contract to prevent it, I don't see anything inherently wrong with doing it.                        </br></br></div>

<code>To answer your question, I think there might be an implicit agreement to play X game, but this is constantly renegotiated during play in many games.</code><br/><br/>I think most players come to the table expecting the game to remain the same. Agreeing to play a certain game system is a social contract step; reneging on the deal means breaking that agreement. Otherwise you could play D&amp;D3.5, and then the GM says "And now we're switching back to D&amp;D 2e for the next scene", and you go: "WTF, mate? We agreed to use the 3.5 rules." You wouldn't even be switching whole games, but you'd break the initial agreement on which rule system you play by.                        </div>

<i>In any case, why is breaking that aspect of the Social Contract a "freak out" occasion?

Is this really happening?"  <br/><br/>We negotiate in order to get consensus.  Shock &amp; switcheroo is a tactic akin to the con artist.  Very different procedures.  This wasn't an ask, or a "hey, so here's what I'm thinking".  It was a whammy.<br/><br/>Though we can develop skills to call things when we see them, it usually requires a state of guardedness, which is why friends and family get away with so much more than strangers could- because our inner rationalizer says, "But wait, I trust this person, this can't be really going on".                        </div>
