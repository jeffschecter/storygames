                    From this thread:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1112</a><br/><br/>I didn't want to derail the good conversation there with this observation:<br/><br/>Bringing up Ricardo Montalban in any tangentially gaming-related conversation is not to pose metaphors of Fantasy Island. There is only one true reason to bring up Mister Montalban in any conversation. HINT:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.poster.net/montalban-ricardo/montalban-ricardo-photo-ricardo-montalban-6205391.jpg"/><br/><br/>Thank you, I'm here all week.<br/><br/>Now, to Matt's point here:<br/>My only addition here would be to suggest language/cultural content. I've been slowly (painfully slowly) been teaching myself Japanese. There are lots of bits of The Mountain Witch that I think would be that much cooler if players used honorifics and refered to things with proper Japanese (starting with the correct pronunciation of "ronin"). However, I think the missing element in this context is a reward mechanism. I could easily envision a game where the GM gave players XP/Fate Points/Drama Dice/small expendable resources whenever they (correctly) used the taught information. Cultural info is similar, but best for a historical game - I made a side comment at last night's TMW game about the differences between Western and Eastern bow technique, but only as color. Basically, anything that better immerses the players in the game experience *and* enhances their knowledge of something should be fair game.<br/><br/>There's something else here in this post which I'd like to throw out as a little idea I had a few months ago but wanted to share: Turning an RPG into a learning experience in much the same way as the above. Not in the "change the world, change yourself!" sense that the Pundit raves on about, but rather a simple "Let's use gaming to learn something".<br/><br/>It was triggered from a long running D&amp;D India game we were in a couple years ago.  Turns out that none of us knew "historic" Indian names, and we knew very little of day-to-day rural life other than food (which probably isn't the rural food that was eaten) and mythology. So we struggled sometimes between "making shit up like we normally do in fantasy", and "feeling guilty that we weren't sticking at least some history/real world stuff in there". And every time we run wikipedia at the gaming table that pretty much distracts us and gaming collapses, so that's not an option.<br/><br/>So I was thinking, what if we played a game of PTA or whatever, and all together decided to simply "learn something". Some thoughts I had were house building/repair (but what kind of game?), cars/car repair (car-themed RPGs are pretty easy to put together), astrology, Eastern European history, whatever.  But I was kinda steering to "somewhat practical in real life", which is why I thought "cars". Anyway, we'd agree each week to, on our own, do like an hour or less of research on that topic, light research like library reading or wikipedia (on "cars and car repair" for example).<br/><br/>Then, when we meet again for gaming, we can sprinkle that new knowledge in the game: "The scene opens. Jed's repairing the transmission of an old Ford. Gus is helping him fiddle the whatzits, and Angela is connecting it to the whateveritscalled", etc.  Not a huge focus on that sort of thing, but just enough knowledge to be useful/interesting in the real world, and make the game that much more enhanced by narration and description.<br/><br/>The same could be done with a language (everyone decides to learn a little Korean), or medicine/anatomy, or forensics, or computers or whatever.<br/><br/>That won't help Jason's contact too much, but in terms of a new way of coming to the table, I think it's worth thinking about.                </div>

                            I don't learn too much from them myself (nothing really sticks) other than "Hugh Laurie is FUCKING OUT OF CONTROL AWESOME", but then again TV is much more passive for me than gaming.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Whenever I see Hugh Laurie in House, my brain goes, "OK, why isn't he speaking like he's from England, and acting really, really stupid?" It's a jarring cognative break going from his characters in Black Adder to House. <br/><br/>Yeah, awesome. <br/><br/>So is Montalban. <br/><br/>Back to your regularly scheduled thread.<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>
