I can already print out threads I like and bind them for my own purposes, and send Andy money.</blockquote>\nActually, that was my question as well, you just happened to have a chance to ask it before I did.<br/><br/>For me, the most useful things pulled from threads (when I wasn't having a blast participating in their creation) were the ideas that I had after reading them and thinking about them a little. Like the Report Card thread: We never made one, but it got me thinking about the creation of report cards. Or the Awesome-ify threads, I started thinking about the "methodology" behind "awesome-izing" a setting, and perhaps bubbling it down to a few equations.<br/><br/>So here's the thing: I really can't imagine a book composed of a bunch of printed-out forum threads, or even posts.  But man, I'd totally love to see an anthology of essays and micro-essays (2-4 paragraphs) from community users, based on a thread here. "<b>What I got out of Push/Pull</b>", "<b>How I used Muy Macho for the better</b>", "<b>How Awesome-ifying Dragonlance worked for my gaming group</b>", etc.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>I think that would be awesome</b></span>.<br/><br/>I also think that it would be reprehensible to ask people to write essays and micro-essays like these, and then give them to me for free, to be compiled into a book which I sell to others for money.  It just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Maybe we can work something out with Jonathan, for some kind of future edition of Push, where we all split the profits in some format.<br/><br/>In the end, after thinking long and hard about it, unless Graham's got a real winner up his sleeve, I can't see (from my limited thinking on the issue) real benefit in such a production as "a collection of threads, but in a book". But maybe we can coordinate and think more on it, though.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113868/#Comment_113868" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T15:13:57+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  3:13PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2007 3:14PM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, for goodness sake, you miserable fuckers.<br/><br/>I'd personally love to have a book like this, which is why I suggested it.

The vibe I get from Graham is that Graham is the target audience of his idea*, which doesn't necessarily help your needs.  So, when it comes to a reference for folks who want to get "caught up" (in published book for or otherwise -- such an idea might be worth being a living document, if someone would actually periodically update it), what sort of things would you want to see?  Threads?  Big Ideas that this forum has generated?  History of that most noble of creatures, the Owlbear?  (Firefox says that "owlbear" isn't a word, so clearly its speciesist.)<br/><br/>I realize that you might not have specific topics to mention, since that's sort of the point of your vision, but is that something that's been mentioned that you've thought "Man, what are they talking about?  Is that summarized somewhere?"<br/><br/>(*That's not a dig against Graham.  Clyde Rhoer has been his own primary target audience for Theory From The Closet, which has produced a show that he likes and, frankly, has become infectious because of his love for his project.  But Clyde's show is still very much his own thing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113985/#Comment_113985" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T03:54:32+00:00" title="December 13, 2007  3:54AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll donate money to the site, but as I'm about as interested in promoting Awesome inanities as I am in putting broken glass in school lunches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113986/#Comment_113986" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T03:54:46+00:00" title="December 13, 2007  3:54AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2007 4:30AM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, listen.<br/><br/>This is the sort of project that's only likely to succeed if there's a big wave of support driving it.

Forget paring down threads and slapping them into a PDF; I'm talking about *exploding* the thread format, sorting by overarching topics or techniques, and then reassembling the "nuggets" into what amount to advice-chunks or mini-essays by the relevant posters.<br/><br/>Thus, there is a very real value-add: those who've read and participated in all these great discussions would be better able to bubble out (sort out, deduce, etc) the overarching categories--the headings of section, put into formatting terms. Likewise, such participants will be able to cull out repetition and, in general, choose some of the most succinct and useful mini-essays for each category and subcategory. In fact, that's sort of what I thought this thread was more about, not just a laundry list but also a project plan/organization.<br/><br/>In my opinion, without such synthesis and organization, the project is worthless--I can read the linked threads above without having to buy a PDF. But with a solid organization, editorial guiding hand(s), and some semblance of reusability (ex: Graham's notion of a "little game ideas" section; or a checklist of DOs and DON'Ts of POD publishing; oracles and setting snippets), I'd buy it for just about any price south of $100.<br/><br/>My 2\xa2 (worth almost 1.43\xa2 on today's Nikkei);<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114138/#Comment_114138" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T12:11:59+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 12:11PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Noble</cite>I think all the nay-sayers are completely accurate if the book is aimed solely at Story-games.com forum veterans who scour the site.

The ones which really explain something or clarify something.  Most awesome threads here fall into the same three categories as 99% of the internet:<br/><br/>1) Someone starts a thread by saying something really awesome.  A few other people agree with him/her.  There are perhaps some clarifications to, and expansions of, the original post, but really it's the first post which contains 90% of the thread's awesome.<br/><br/>1a) is exactly like the above, but someone else contributes something equally awesome later in the thread.  So here you have 2 really great posts and a fuckton of clarifications, agreement, disagreements and whatnot, but again, 90% of the awesome exists in two (or three, but basically 5% of the) posts.  <br/><br/>2) Someone starts a thread asking a question, or asking for advice about something.  A bunch of people respond with good and valid advice but someone posts a really spot-on, balls-to-the-wall perfect answer, explanation or bit of advice which just reeks of Awesome and Win.  Again, 80%+ of the thread's awesome is in that one post, but that post rarely makes sense outside of the context of the thread in which it appears.<br/><br/>2a) is exactly like that but with multiple Awesome responses.  80% of the awesome is still in those couple of posts though.<br/><br/>3) A discussion starts and people make a lot of posts, tossing ideas back and fourth explaining stuff, investigating things and discovering things.  Somewhere, a conclusion is reached, and something really Awesome is born, but it's spread over twenty or so posts.  There's no single posts you can point to to say "this is where the awesome is in this thread", but the thread is awesome nonetheless.<br/><br/>How does this relate to G-Dogg's book idea?  Well, the obvious thing is to get the book to be in some way more useful than the website.  And the way you do that is to distil Teh Awesome down into easier chunks to swallow.  So you find those posts which contain the majority of the awesome in those Type 1 and 2 threads, and you get the authors to tidy them up and incorporate anything from the rest of the thread they think is also Teh Awesome.  Possibly you to bring in another person or two who contributed to the thread's Awesome to re-write their nuggets so they fit in or just get their permission to be quoted from the thread.  You end up with a set of essays which are the Distilled Essence of SG's Awesome.  It'll be better presented than a bunch of threads, it'll offer far greater Awesome Per Page than simply reprinting threads in whole.<br/><br/><i>That</i> would be a great book.  <i>That</i> would be useful to all sorts of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114350/#Comment_114350" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T10:05:45+00:00" title="December 14, 2007 10:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>And the way you do that is to distil Teh Awesome down into easier chunks to swallow.

There are a number of cases of awesome where the idea in a thread was revised partway-through because of the input.
