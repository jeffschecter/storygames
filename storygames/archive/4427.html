So, for example, you can spend 2 points, and then you need only roll 2 or more.<br/><br/>I'd like to simulate this mechanic with cards (not playing cards, just cards). How would I do that?<br/><br/>The obvious way, of course, is to have Stability cards (each one is a point and you discard them). And then you'd have a deck of cards numbered from 1 to 10 as a randomiser.<br/><br/>But that's a lot of cards. Could I, in some way, build the randomiser into the Stability cards themselves? The probabilities needn't be <i>exactly</i> the same, as long as they work similarly.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100001/#Comment_100001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T08:44:57+00:00" title="September 30, 2007  8:44AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick thought. You hold N playing cards. Spend any <i>face cards</i> you hold to reduce the target. Face cards have no actual value (their value spent is 0, but maybe they do something <i>additional</i> that's fun, like some kind of cool failure, I dunno).<br/><br/>You need to get, say, a 7 or better on the card value by default.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure this works (for example, is 7 too hard? Too easy? Are the enough face cards to make this workable? etc.). But, it's a start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100048/#Comment_100048" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T17:16:32+00:00" title="September 30, 2007  5:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2007 5:23PM by Simon_C.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For this, I'm assuming when you say "on a die" above, that you mean a six sided die. <br/><br/>Use playing cards.  Each player is dealt a number of playing cards equal to their stability score at the start of the session.  When you'd make a roll, draw any number of cards from the top of of your deck of stability cards.  If all the cards you draw are red cards, you lose the appropriate amount of Stability cards.  Discard all the cards you drew, and shuffle one new card into your stability deck.<br/><br/>This has the fun addition that you're never 100% safe, no matter how many cards you draw.  <br/><br/>If you didn't mean a six sided die, then it's a little more complex.  Instead of using red or black, you'll have to use the value of the card.  7 or more for d6s, and, what (here my math is all screwy) maybe 6s or fives for d8s, and so on.  I think the odds are much more wonky for this.<br/><br/>To really take advantage of using cards here, I'd add in extra flavour, like, if all the cards you draw are face cards, something special happens.  If they're all black face cards, maybe you gain some stability, or you get something like the "mad insight" from CoC?.  If they're all red, maybe you lose double, or have a moment of total panic?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100101/#Comment_100101" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T04:49:30+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  4:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmmm. I did say "Not playing cards". But it's quite useful.<br/><br/>Oh, I should point out that this is a LARP system. So I'm wary of drawing new cards, if I can avoid it.<br/><br/>I wonder if this would work? There are six symbols (as an example, let's use ! " \xc2\xa3 $ % ^) and each Stability card shows three (for example, \xc2\xa3 % ^).<br/><br/>There are ability cards, too, and they have one symbol on, each (for example, $).<br/><br/>To do a Stability check, another player draws one of their ability cards and you draw one of your Stability cards, both at random. If there's a matching symbol, you're fine; otherwise, you must discard an appropriate number of Stability cards. <br/><br/>(That's the equivalent of just rolling the die, with a 50% chance of success. Each Stability card represents a point of stability in the original mechanics).<br/><br/>Alternatively (here's the equivalent of spending Stability points to add to the roll), you can produce more than one Stability card. Then, if <i>any</i> of the symbols on the cards you produce match the symbol on the Ability card, you're fine, but you must discard all but one of the cards. If they don't, you must discard all but one of the cards, <i>plus</i> an appropriate number of additional Stability cards.<br/><br/>Does that work? The probabilities aren't quite the same, but they're close, aren't they?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100135/#Comment_100135" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T07:40:23+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  7:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are cards other than playing cards?

You could do the same thing without drawing a new card at the end, which just means that you lose a point of stability every time you make a check.  That may or may not be an issue, depending on how many you start with.  Or they can just do a blind swap with another player, to make sure they don't know the contents of their deck.<br/><br/>The way you're suggesting would work fine, although it could lead to some weirdness if a character's only got the one card left, seeking out players with lots of abilities that match the symbols on their remaining cards.  Bug or feature?<br/><br/>What about coins? Have a pocket full of change, and flip as many as you want when you have to make a roll.  If any are heads, you're fine.  Otherwise, lose some coins.  Lose all but one of the flipped coins.  Coin flipping runs into some problems in a LARP though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
