The CoS rules would be hot shit for dtermining who's winning the war on the streets.<br/><br/>So Static, yeah that's command and politics and all the bullshit as seen in the Wire where they don't want you pursuing the top of the chain and instead just want dope on the table for PR.<br/><br/>I envisoned chain of command sending down orders you didn't want to hear and the players resisting.  Stuff like raiding the stash house before all the evidence has been gathered to pin it on the top dog.  If players resisted command, pissed them off, went against their orders they gained static.<br/><br/>As static increased shit would happen like it does in Lacuna.  Maybe after enough points they pull some resources from your team, order you to bring someone in too early, maybe threaten your career.  <br/><br/>It's called Murder Police.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332676/#Comment_332676" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T08:24:13+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  8:24AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that there's kind of a balancing act going on between heart rate and static in a Lacuna session.  If you have a few players, you will tend to burn through HR and the static stays low.  On the other hand, a larger team will generate a lot more static without getting all wound up.<br/><br/>Because I want static to be a issue in the game, I'll use a shorter scale for small teams.  That way they can trigger the events that help to give Blue City that 'off/odd' feel that I want.  For me, static is a tool for the setting and perhaps 'scripted' events/wandering monsters.<br/><br/>Other games will have a tilt, Lacuna has a slide in to Chaos and you can do this easily with static.<br/><br/>I write up a separate static chart for each session.  Since I run a pretty open ended sand box version of Blue City, this gives me another tool to integrate mission related elements when the players decide to take a tangent.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332784/#Comment_332784" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T13:12:44+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  1:12PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles, I haven't seen the Wire, so I'm only half getting you.

The system is as corrupt as the bad guys and the bad guys don't suffer from red tape.<br/><br/>Your special unit would be following a drug-ring lead by some gangster.  A murder or two should happen at the very beginning (1st scene) and your unit's objective is to bring down the top guy for the murders.  So Static would look like this:<br/><br/>3 - Commanding Officer gives the unit a call, he's agitated and wants results ASAP.  <br/>5 - CO pulls a useful man from the squad (NPC) or some other resource (vehicles, technology, whatever)<br/>8 - Command calls in the group for a special meeting where they want the evidence laid out and threaten to shut the team down<br/>9 - Orders come down to bring in the thug who committed the murders (the drug-ring doesn't know you're watching them but they will now)<br/>12 - More bodies fall and the Commissioner has had it.  He wants a department-wide act of aggression to let the criminals know this won't be tolerated.  You're being ordered to move on the stash houses you've identified.<br/>15 - Your unit's being dismantled due to lack of results and funding.  Continuing the case will have to happen on your own time or you'll have to take risks while working your normal case.<br/>17 - One or more PC's are stripped of rank and or transferred.  Either the campaign ends or we skip ahead maybe a year to where a new unit is formed, maybe some old characters return.<br/><br/>So yeah, you don't want to be aggressive and show your hand until you have the right evidence to arrest the top criminal.  Making busts and arrests early lets the criminals know they're being monitored and they circle the wagons.  They also go quiet.  <br/><br/>There would have to be a way to lower Static in this system, but it would be much slower than it going up.  The point is for the game to culminate with a high static level and the criminal being busted, or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332798/#Comment_332798" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T13:59:06+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  1:59PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh and a huge part of the game is having a large bulletin board where you tack pictures to it as new contacts and criminals are observed (this happens in the show).

Either stall or death march.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333213/#Comment_333213" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:44:08+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIRC static is "secretly tracked" in the RAW, but we always <i>always</i> tracked it out in the open, for various obvious psych reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333215/#Comment_333215" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:48:20+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:48PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>IIRC static is "secretly tracked" in the RAW, but we always<i>always</i>tracked it out in the open, for various obvious psych reasons.</blockquote>\nThe players talk about Static: +1 static.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333244/#Comment_333244" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T17:15:56+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  5:15PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I LIKE IT!</i>   :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaibutsu" title="kaibutsu"><img alt="kaibutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaibutsu">kaibutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333513/#Comment_333513" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T13:41:19+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  1:41PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The fourth-wall static sources in the game I've been running are:<br/>\n- Any use of electronic devices.  (Interference!)<br/>\n- Referring to other players by the player name, rather than the Agent pseudonym.<br/>\n- Side conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first game I ran had story events explicitly linked to Static, but I threw that out precisely because of pacing issues.  Now the static relates to the theme of the given story (often accentuating the nature of the HP or an important location) rather than directly driving the story.  Though I have been using a couple of low-static events to trigger clues about where to find the HP.  (For one game the Static 2 event was finding a rosary, which, in turn, led the characters to the Church of the Logicians, in Central.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the game we played last night, two Agents started fighting with each other _after_ taking out the HP.  This led to a crazy spiral of static accumulation, in which it seemed the very world was falling apart around the Agents involved (the other two managed to eject before the shit really hit the fan).  I've been thinking of Static as pollution caused by the intrusion of the Agents into Blue City; it can certainly wreak havoc on the local ecosystem...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan" title="MountZionRyan"><img alt="MountZionRyan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/426/nG1TIXTID71FS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan">MountZionRyan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333587/#Comment_333587" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T08:19:51+00:00" title="July  8, 2011  8:19AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use fourth wall static triggers.
