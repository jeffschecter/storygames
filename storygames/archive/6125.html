They sell t-shirts for the indie videogames they've made which come with free copies of the game on the t-shirt. The games themselves are freely available online (with perhaps 1 or 2 exceptions; those shirts come with demos instead of the full game). It is essentially the webcomics business model, where you give away a product, and then sell means of identifying with the product.<br/><br/>You may have clicked on the link above and realized that the store is not open yet. I say to you, this does not matter.<br/><br/>The shirts (with games attached) are already available nation wide in the US via Target stores for $12 a piece.<br/><br/>This shocks and amazes me as a feat of indie games gumption.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136487/#Comment_136487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T10:13:57+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 10:13AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!<br/><br/>When I read this...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>They sell t-shirts for the indie videogames they've made which come with free copies of the game on the t-shirt. </blockquote>\n...I thought you meant someone was making RPGs whose rules were printed on T-shirts.

In general, I can see a lot of traction for rule-bearing T-shirts in LARP games.</blockquote>\nOnce when browsing Cafepress, I found a set of T-shirts intended for a wedding's rehearsal dinner: each identified the wedding guest by their role.  "Father of the Bride", "Sister of the groom", "Best Man", etc.  And I thought, naturally "I could make a LARP out of this".<br/><br/>But paying $15 or so per LARPer was beyond my budget, and I don't know if my friends would each chip in $15 for one night's entertainment and a T-shirt that wasn't much use afterward.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>But you could totally give a really basic set of rules for the LARP, and then have each character have one "exception based" rule, like in a card game.  So if the conflict rules involved playing playing cards from a hand, maybe my T-shirt lets me see your hand first, or restricts the cards you can play, or has some other funky effect.  <br/><br/>Or doesn't have a mechanical effect but establishes limits on player interaction: "Once per conversation, this player can demand a truthful answer from you, and you must answer them truthfully."  "Any male character finds this character extremely attractive."   Etc.<br/><br/>I think these rules would best apply to the person <i>not</i> wearing the shirt, but instead apply to people interacting with the shirt wearer.  To avoid having to read your shirt upside down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136669/#Comment_136669" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T12:07:26+00:00" title="March 27, 2008 12:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 12:08PM by David Artman.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting points. I guess I didn't make it clear that the shirts wouldn't be kept by the players, but reused (EWWW!).<br/><br/>Maybe make a line of shirts which maps to various common functions in a popular LARP (I'll use Vamp, Were): Obfuscated, Crinos Form, Majesty, Etc. So, if you play in a campaign LARP in which you need to occasionally "switch forms" or "active effects" that typically require a gesture or which can cause flow-breaking OOC conversation ("Hey, get HIM!" "OOC: No, dude, I'm obfuscated; make your perception check first" "Oh, hell, nevermind"), you switch shirts. (Some LARPs use a variety of headbands for such "tells".)<br/><br/>Or... suppose someone makes a game that's sort of like one of these con treasure-hunt games or some-such. Your shirt tells your role to others who might be playing, as does their shirts; and the system does like what you said (i.e. read what I can do to Role FOO on his shirt, he reads what he can do to or ask of me from my shirt text--heck, you could even have different rules for if I've snuck up on him, on the shirt back).<br/><br/>Anyhow... this would make a good new thread: Make a Game That Uses T-Shirts. Game Chef 2009, anyone? Imagine the revenue stream, if your game was geared to con-play, with groups in the scores, and a ton of roles available as shirt!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136923/#Comment_136923" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T18:59:56+00:00" title="March 29, 2008  6:59PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked this concept, as it put awareness of these games in average consumers who wouldn't know the difference between Puzzle Quest and Kings Quest.<br/><br/>Sad to say, Target immediately yanked them off shelves just as media awareness was being made about these items.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
