Interesting topic.  Like last time, let me think about it for a few days and reply with some specific thoughts.<br/><br/>From the get-go, this site has been an experiment, with the idea firmly in place (like a kill-switch) that if it doesn't satisfy, I can pull the plug and it will all go away (well, to be nice I'd archive it somewhere for a few years, but still).  As we were discussing before, that thought translates to a great deal of stress-free administration (plus the ability for people, for the most part, to police themselves).  As it is, this place is my favorite venue for gaming discussion still. Administration has been a dream, even as we have increased through <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>1,000+ users</b></span> (losing some in the process, of course). <br/><br/>That's the main thing I'm worring about, too many voices, too many conflicting opinions, or worse too many threads, and too much thread-turnover. But right now, it's still working well. No major firebombs or flamewars recently. By my recent busy-ass schedule I can only check this site maybe 10 minutes a day on some days (30 minutes or more if I'm lucky), and I still get a lot out of this place.  Thus, it stays.<br/><br/>Challenges: Yeah, the one thing I'm currently waffling on is the relaxing of my "no ground-up game discussion here" rules. Some people have gained a lot of help with their games by discussing them here, and that rocks (especially for people who were, y'know, participating here in discussions and the like, and not just appearing out of nowhere and posting a lot of "look at my game" posts; which I've seen other places but luckily not here too much). I'm fearing that opening the floodgates of "more game design discussion" will mean that all of the awesome regular/small press/hippy gaming discussion threads will fly off the first page or get sunk quickly as people post mini-updates and micro-questions in a "give me more responses to my game" style discussions.  I'm trying to think of a way to balance all of this.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think a little part of me had hoped, way back some 18 months ago, that by now we would have seen someone pick up the reigns and create another game design community. There's the RPG Laboratory, and the excellent SPIN (game rule) discussion site, but I feel they're a little underutilized and unknown (I'll try to promote them more as places to talk about game design, not to mention Levi's Gamecraft). I may choose to open up S-G a little more to accommodate designs in the interim, or create a sister-site that uses the same software (perhaps even carries over the login accounts) but focuses on game design. We'll see.<br/><br/>In a year?  I hope that we just see more of the same: Raw Enthusiasm. Raw Enthusiasm leading to Game Discussion. No (or extremely little) Bitterness. Fun threads. "High discussion" threads. Crazy awesome links in the monthly link threads. More community/group projects and meetups.<br/><br/>Also, I'd love to give "the crowd" a chance to speak up at the podium. I won't reply to everything : Don't mistake my silence for not listening, or opposition, I just don't want to clutter and scatter the discussion with one-line responses.  I will absolutely read and take to heart any feedback given.<br/><br/>So... anyone have anything to say about the community? Anything they would like to see in the next year?  Anything that you guys see as challenges that need to be addressed?  (I probably don't even need to mention it but: Negative feedback is A-OK. But keep it as bitterness-free as possible).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76296/#Comment_76296" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T18:52:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  6:52PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and some more random thoughts:<br/><br/>Busy as hell these days at work (10-11 hour days straight without lunches; just in too much of a crunch), and the last thing I want to do after sitting in front of a computer all day is to go home and sit in front of a computer, BUT...<br/><br/>* In the next 6 months, I want to work out some sort of solid Chat system/Chat room.<br/><br/>* I also want to create a general FAQ on this site, and how to use it, and links to other awesome sites (Gamecraft, Iris, Knife Fight, etc).<br/><br/>* I will also put another "tab" at the top so that people can click on it and find the Wiki easily, without having to remember where it is (I figure less than half the active members here have seen it; I'm not a huge Wiki guy, but I can't deny that there's some folks that have gained a lot from the Codex, and I want to make sure they get the most of it that they can).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76298/#Comment_76298" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T19:04:25+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  7:04PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rather than contribute something useful, I'd like to just take a moment to thank Andy profusely for all the awesome, hard work he's done with Story Games.<br/><br/>That said, is there anything we could do to help you out -- either individually or as a group?
