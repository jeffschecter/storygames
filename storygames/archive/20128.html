Whats it about </blockquote>\nThank you for asking! I'm posting quotations from the manual as the answer:\n<blockquote>What\u2019s This About?<br/>Present time, real world, just a regular evening.<br/>There are two characters who are good friends, but \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 can\u2019t often spend time together. You\u2019ll give them a name when you play, but in these rules we just reference them as \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019.<br/>X and Y are both adults, currently single, and they are or at least appear to be (according to the society at large, no matter how they feel themselves) of different genders. There\u2019s no romance going on between them: they\u2019re just good friends.<br/>There are two more characters to this story: X\u2019s parents, whom Y is just about to meet for the first time. For whatever reason (the details are left for the players to establish), both friends are going to spend the night \u2013 or possibly multiple nights \u2013 at X\u2019s parents\u2019 house. This game is all about the awkwardness of that first evening together, when Y has just arrived and is getting to know X\u2019s family.<br/>It\u2019s awkward because of course the parents are incorrectly assuming that X and Y are actually a couple!</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Playing Awkward usually involves funny characters, humorous situations and loud laughs, but you may encounter less comfortable, more bittersweet moments as well. These \u201cdeeper\u201d facets of your play experience may turn out to be just as pleasurable as its comical sides, maybe more. Comedy and ridicule have long been both upheld and dreaded as powerful tools to effect (or to prevent) change from within societies.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444608/#Comment_444608" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T23:59:15+00:00" title="April  6, 2015 11:59PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell me more about being the Play Director, and why you like it so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444611/#Comment_444611" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-07T09:43:43+00:00" title="April  7, 2015  9:43AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Tell me more about being the Play Director, and why you like it so much.</blockquote>\nBesides being the only non-acting audience to their play (which is very rewarding in itself, as what happens on stage is usually hilarious and exciting) I love interacting with players through the Uncomfortable Chair technique. You get to pick some piece of character of situation which they offered to the group in the first place and point the lights on it so that it gets developed more. It's all about contributing to the overall play experience without <i>introducing</i> content of your own, and making the biggest effect with the least intervention. It's subtle: the hardest role in the game to perform well, but effortless if you do perform it well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444614/#Comment_444614" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-07T14:40:54+00:00" title="April  7, 2015  2:40PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How much autobiograpichal is this game?<br/>(NB: I tried it and the game rocks!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444615/#Comment_444615" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-07T14:52:57+00:00" title="April  7, 2015  2:52PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How much autobiograpichal is this game?<br/>(NB: I tried it and the game rocks!)</blockquote>\nIt's not autobiographical <i>at all</i>.

I usually describe it as a reality TV "confession booth" rendered as a jeepform-style meta-technique. It's closely based on what I've seen some <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt/" rel="nofollow">Doubt</a> GMs do between scenes, made systematic and a central focus of play. After designing Awkward I also employed this technique with little change (and I daresay successfully) in another game, which so far has only been played/playtested once.\n<blockquote>What differentiates between doing it well and doing it, well, awkwardly?</blockquote>\nThis is the hardest thing to articulate in writing, actually, and that last section of the book I'm not yet finished writing is mostly about it. I can only hope my prose will be effective enough at the task of "teaching" this most important technique. My hopes are high, though, because the technique is not, in itself, a difficult one, and I trust my average reader to be a brilliant learner.\n<blockquote>My question for you is: Is there any mechanical way the situation is made awkward, or is it entirely player generated?

Mostly, the awkwardness is inherent in the starting situation and reinforced through the details of character creation. All players are empowered to further ramp it up (the Director, too, can try and do so via some skillful uncomfortable chair use).

It was run in 2-hour slots at conventions, outdoors events, and as an after-dinner party game with family &amp; friends. No kidding!<br/>Maybe it's just Italians, but the subject of the game always made it a very easy sell around here.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444937/#Comment_444937" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-24T17:23:53+00:00" title="April 24, 2015  5:23PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true!<br/><br/>I think it's the hardcore gamers who might have the most difficult time with it, in contrast...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444948/#Comment_444948" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-24T21:26:55+00:00" title="April 24, 2015  9:26PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think it's the hardcore gamers who might have the most difficult time with it, in contrast...</blockquote>\nI don't disagree. I mean, I've played it with "hardcore gamers" who did a great job playing it, but never in a group having that outlook <i>exclusively</i> (unless you count experimental larpers as hardcore gamers, I guess). It was always in some kind of environment where curiosity or enthusiasm for the game prevailed, which set a base ground for playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
