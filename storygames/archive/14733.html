Six to a page or something like that; a cast sheet.<br/>Are there games that have two different character sheets, one for the player and one for the GM?<br/>What about games that have a sheet for your character and the other player characters?  Part of the sheet would have your character information, and the other part would have information about the other characters.  A place to keep track of how they've related to you during the game.<br/>I hope I'm explaining this clearly enough?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335061/#Comment_335061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T09:23:52+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  9:23AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 9:25AM by thadrine.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are many different types of "Player aid" character sheets out there that have spaces for additional bits of information like this, but not many games that make it part of the mechanics. <br/><br/>I know 7th Sea had a Gossip sheet to track favor/dislike with other players and NPC's. <br/>Kingdom of Nothing has the rest of the players define your back story, and the GM is the only one that holds it. <br/>Smallville has stats that represent the relationships that you have with other PCs and NPCs.<br/><br/>I am sure there are a few more, but all I can think of right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335073/#Comment_335073" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T10:09:14+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 10:09AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recall that in Paranoia XP you can get to create most of your character but then it's the GM who gets to use your character sheet and tell you what kind of thins your character can do. It's actually part of the mechanics, sinde the idea is to keep players misinformed of everything in the setting.<br/>I also made a simple game where I used a character sheet to keep track of how the relationships with the PCs were going. It's only useful in games where your players don't keep killing NPCs for fun. However I don't think that mechanic was new when I started using it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335074/#Comment_335074" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T10:15:00+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 10:15AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard has a GM sheet, which helps to keep track of the player character's pivotal information (beliefs, goals, instincts, contacts, etc) as well as the seasons.<br/><br/>In Unknown Armies, the GM keeps track of the character's hit points, but there is no separate sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335086/#Comment_335086" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T11:19:22+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 11:19AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 11:19AM by NickWedig.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most larps I've played or ran have had a separate section of your sheet detailing the other PCs.

The most common one being probably a gm reference sheet to keep together basic information about characters. It works well I'm games such as Kagematsu or Ganakagok. Gm writes down only ideas (places and objects of a particular value for a character in Kagematsu or fears in Ganakagok for example) and not stats (these are only on character sheets). Such a reference sheet helps gm to frame and flesh out scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in Ganakagok there are sheets that do not belong to anyone in particular, ie. a map of the world and a map of connections.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
