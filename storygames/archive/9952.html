This showcases the freedom of Capes, but you often end up with goofy, off-the-wall crap and it tends to produce unsatisfying, meandering stories.<br/><br/>So now I try to come up with tight, short term arcs. Mini-series I always wanted to see but never did.

It's easy to address the conflict "Robot army crushes Manhattan" with the trait "Power Blast" or "Massive Property Damage".  Those traits are less useful addressing the conflict "Mother disapproves of your decision to move in with Susie".  Fighty scenes work really well, but we had problems with the talky scenes:  because traits like "Deceptive" and "Noble" are not powered, they can be used only once in a scene.  After you exhaust those, all you have left are "Proton Surge" and "Bloodbath".<br/><br/>Second, we ran into a problem with the Debt economy.  Basically when you use a Power you accrue Debt which you can then stake on a conflict and convert to Story Tokens to give to other people.  We ran into a problem with a hero staking a large amount of debt, then losing and becoming overdrawn, which meant that hero must stake even more debt.  This had two effects:  creating heroes so overwhelmingly overdrawn that players would opt to choose other characters to play in a scene, or (if those overdrawn heroes were eventually successful) flooding the game with Story Tokens.  We routinely had situations in which multiple players were sitting on stacks of 10+ Story Tokens.  BUT WAIT - before you say "duh, you should be spending them more often":  we were continually running into time constraint problems, and spending Story Tokens to take additional actions or introduce new characters would stretch scenes into being waaaaaayyyyy longer than we wanted.  <br/><br/>All that being said, Capes is one of my favorite games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220988/#Comment_220988" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T12:52:51+00:00" title="July 27, 2009 12:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a LOT of Capes. I'm also biased, as I'm a friend of the designer -- Tony Lower-Basch -- and in fact go to know him first online as he thrashed out the game and then in person as a playtester.<br/><br/>The game definitely works well with some initial structure to start off with, either a "scenario" for a quick-start game or some collective word-building (if only "we want Punisher and Batman-style heroes, not Superman-style) for a longer-term one; while it's very light on prep, "it's GM-less, you can do anything, go!" doesn't seem to work. It also does have weird fiddly bits in the mechanics that I still stumble over. But it does do some beautiful things I, at least, haven't seen in as developed a form elsewhere:<br/><br/>- Continuity is explicitly rewarded. Since almost every conflict produces Inspirations that can be traded for bonuses in future conflicts, players are constantly rewarded for remembering cool stuff people did last time and bringing it back into play somehow.<br/><br/>- Everyone has an opportunity, and a requirement, to narrate. You can't simply say "I attack" and roll dice; you have to tell at least a tiny piece of story on your turn -- which means that one dominant personality can't reduce everyone to near-silence by talking over them.<br/><br/>- Rewards for appealing to the other players are not just a mechanic (e.g. "fan mail") but THE central mechanic. Every round of every conflict forces you to confront whether your contribution to the story is engaging enough to encourage other players to bid resources which, potentially, become your resources.<br/><br/>- Rewards for losing are central -- and not just losing a conflict but deciding how you lost, but for giving up narrative control to other players. Players bid resources against each other to win conflicts, and when the conflict's resolved, the winner's resources (in the form of Debt) change hands and become the loser's (in the form of story tokens). The system means that, to do at all well in mechanical terms, you MUST learn to let go of creative control and trust your fellow players to shine.<br/><br/>All these mechanics, while fiddly at times, mean that Capes is constantly teaching you (1) to listen to what your fellow players want, (2) give them what they want, and (3) graciously cede creative control on a regular basis.<br/><br/>I once saw a pick-up Capes game with a whopping eight players. In the free-form conversation before we started playing, there were two dominant personalities while other people occasionally chimed in and a few were almost totally silent. Once we started the game, however, the rules structure got everyone to participate at least a little, forced one dominant personality to listen closely &amp; appeal strongly to what others wanted, and effectively shut the other dominant personality out when he failed to listen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax" title="BastardToadflax"><img alt="BastardToadflax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax">BastardToadflax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220991/#Comment_220991" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T13:04:33+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  1:04PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, this is all really useful.

Myself, I've only played Capes in one-shots, though I'd like to play a game of a few sessions sometime. The cool things I've seen are:\n<ol>\n<li>That slick economy that lets you stake all to win, but rewards you in defeat. It allows you to pick your battles, choosing to put up memorable opposition in one arena but then shifting focus to the conflict you <i>really</i><br/></li><li>Cool narrative constraints that pace the story by, for instance, setting the subject of a conflict as off limits until the conflict mechanically resolves. This answers the question of, "if there's no combat system and hitpoints, why don't I just narrate that I kill him?" elegantly, by saying: "Anything goes, except if you REALLY care about it put it out on the table to fight over it." This also encourages you to let loose in narration, not pulling any punches, because you know you can hit Captain undershorts as hard as you can and he can still bounce back, until the conflict's conclusion.</li>\n<li>Facilitating the narration of the bold action and pulse-pounding prose of superheroes, through creative prompts like traits and Drives like Obsession, Love or Justice. Inspirations, too. These all encourage everything you want from 70s or 80s comics stories, from wham-slam action to terse pontificating tlo overwrought thought balloons.</li>\n<li>You get to play with all these toylike components like snap-together character sheets, colored chips, and piles of dice on cards! I made my own kit. How cool is that??</li>\n</ol>\nI've played with both Mike and David, above, and had a great time. Mike's absolutely right that grounding the game in peripheral relationships (which by the rules tie into the hero's Drives, so that, say, Mary Jane is Peter Parker's Love Exemplar, and Jonah Jameson his Truth Exemplar) is vital to getting an emotionally invested, Story Now experience. I have played without the Drives and their Exemplars (using the Capes Lite quickstart rules, <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/index.html" rel="nofollow">available on Tony's website</a>), and it's fun too but, as folks have said, a little loopy and random. Good for some settings and groups, and not for others. It's cotton candy and Capes-with-relationships is chili-fries, but they're all still a Carnival. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've heard about the infamous long-term game from Mike and his fellow players, and I have a couple of thoughts about that. I can definitely see how a single character repeatedly losing conflicts would become an issue. On one level the game doesn't address that directly; it's possible, with the dice flying, to lose and keep on losing. A bit fluke-y, but possible. However, there is an indirect (but intentional design-wise, I think) avenue to address it: that character's player needs to be offered (because they want sweet, sweet Story Tokens from him) Conflicts the other players are willing to let him win. Not because they simply take a dive, but because there are other Conflicts at the same time that they care about more. Which means that the player in question needs to be figuring out what THOSE conflicts are, and throwing them out as bait to distract them from his own prize. I don't know what went down precisely, but that is Capes' (somewhat Darwinistic) answer to the problem.<br/><br/>My second observation, on the subject of power narrations being unsuitable to quiet and reserved conflicts, is twofold: 1) narrating a Power doesn't have to mean using it in combat--it can mean NOT using it for fear of discovery, THREATENING to use it, or using it in a subtle way. This still puts the Action the Way You Like it, True Believer! aspect forward, but that is kinda the genre, right? Even for a "relationship scene or whatever. but even more potent for this issue is 2) you don't have to use the same "character build" for a given character from scene to scene. That's right, you can have a "civilian version" of Peter Parker with "Photographer" in the place of "Spider-Powers," and thus have more suitable traits to call on for interacting with "normal life." Or for the <i>super-</i>advanced option, MIXING Powers with civilian traits, so you might have "Spider-Powers" (as a single ability) and Web-Shooters with "Shoot a Web Unnoticed" as a style, combined with "Snap Pix," "Negotiate for Rent Money" and "Dote on Aunt", all combined on the same module! That should give you all the resources to cope with any problem Peter Parker has ever faced between 1962 and 1988, right?<br/><br/>By the way, stop me if I'm going to fast, brad. This is still your thread and I don't want to overwhelm you with all this veteran-player talk.
