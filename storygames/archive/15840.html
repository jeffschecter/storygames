After a few people urged me in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15810" rel="nofollow">another thread</a> to attend Dreamation, I took the plunge and got my room and registration and all that good stuff, so I'll be there.  Since this is my first time, however, I have a question about how getting into the available games is done.<br/><br/>From what I've been able to gather, at some point in the very near future the Dreamation site will offer up a complete list of events for which one may register.  Obviously these have limited seating, so I'm going to guess competition to be the first come and first served is fierce.  Though no one's said so, I'm further guessing that registration happens via the site somehow.  Pointing and clicking may be involved.<br/><br/>It was recommended to me that I have a couple or three backup games in mind for every slot.  Which makes me ask an etiquette question: do I just register for a whole slew of games, hoping I get one of them, and then let the other ones slide when the hour arrives?  If I end up in two games in the same slot, is it seriously uncool to choose one over the other, thus possibly cutting out someone who really wanted to play in that game but couldn't register because I took their spot?  Is this scenario even possible, given the set-up Dreamation has?<br/><br/>Anyway, I have questions.  If you have answers, please do feel free to put them here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359778/#Comment_359778" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T10:10:17+00:00" title="February 15, 2012 10:10AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You actually just send in an email once the schedule is sent out, with your preferences in ranked order by timeslot and by the event's code number. (The indie RPGs all have the prefix "R", except some of the Jeepform LARPs, which have "L.") So you'll say something like:<br/><br/>Saturday 9 AM: 1st choice R209, 2nd choice R212, 3rd choice R211.<br/><br/>And do the same for all the slots that you are attending.<br/><br/>Once Vinny compiles everything, you will only be pre-reg'd for one game in each slot. But, if something else that you wanted more in a particular slot opens up, it's not a big deal to switch\u2014most of the time the game you're switching out of will have alternates who will step in to take your place.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359786/#Comment_359786" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T10:36:39+00:00" title="February 15, 2012 10:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, so it's essentially a hand-administered thing.

What should you expect?<br/><br/><b>Finding Stuff</b><br/><br/>It's a big, sprawling hotel. You should seek out at least three distinct areas:<br/><br/>1) Registration. The place where you get your badge and shit. It's usually not far from the exhibition/dealer's room. Go there first, get your badge and welcome bag. Then proceed to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> to sign up for games.<br/><br/>2) The RPG area. Where the rooms for the games are, and where the sign-up sheets for the games are. The hallways usually have papers covering the walls. These are sign-up sheets. They're usually organized by category and number. Find games you want to play and add your name to them. If you preregistered, your name will be typed on the sign-up sheet already.<br/><br/>3) The IPR booth. This is where indie games are sold. It's usually a cramped little table or two near the RPG area -- NOT in the dealer's hall. Story Gamers also tend to hang out in this area.<br/><br/><br/><b>Meeting People</b><br/><br/>By and large, story gamers are a friendly bunch, but we often forget that there are new folks around. A lot of us already know a bunch of people there, and we can't walk twenty paces without seeing someone we haven't seen in a year. Do not let this intimidate you. We'd love to meet new people. <br/><br/>A good way to meet folks is just to say hello and tell us who you are. Remind us how we might know you ("I'm Sam! with an exclamation point on Story Games"). Don't be surprised if you get confused looks at first, and then that moment of recognition a bit later ("Oh, hi!"). There are a lot of people at Dreamation and it can be overwhelming to remember who everyone is. But it's awesome to put faces to names.<br/><br/>The best way to meet people is to hang out in the hotel lounge in the evening and at night. People start getting too tired to game, but we're too stubborn to go to bed when there are all these cool people around, so we hang out, maybe have a drink, and kibitz. Find a group of people, ask if it's okay if you join them, and they'll probably say yes. By the evening, you'll probably know a few people there anyway.<br/><br/><b>Food</b><br/><br/>People need to eat. It's a great time to get some face time with new friends. Often people don't mind if another person tags along. Find out what people are doing for lunch or for dinner. <br/><br/>Some of us regular attendees get brave and walk a few blocks to local restaurants. There's a great burrito place not too far away. There's a fantastic Japanese place within walking distance. <br/><br/>The con has food, too. The con staff tends to feed the GMs. I think the hotel sells relatively cheap, edible fare like hot dogs and nachos. Sometimes you just want to grab something quick and take it with you to your next game. I think they usually sell bottles of water, which you'll want. (Better, bring your own refillable water bottle--yay, environment!--or buy one of theirs and refill it yourself from the tap.)<br/><br/><b>Gaming!</b><br/><br/>I suspect there will be an overwhelming number of fantastic games to play in this year. Hopefully, you'll get into the games you want. Even if you can't, do not despair. It's possible (though often tricky) to find people interested in playing games that aren't scheduled or slotted. Just find an empty table in one of the free gaming areas (make sure you're not in someone's slotted table) and game with new friends.<br/><br/>There are a couple different approaches to scheduling. I used to schedule every single slot and play until I had screamed myself hoarse and could barely keep my eyes open. These days, I tend to schedule a far less busy con for myself, spend as much time socializing as I do gaming, and get a solid eight hours of sleep. Occasionally, I'll take a refreshing, one-hour nap during an open slot, mid-con. You get less gaming in that way, but the gaming is better (especially towards the end).<br/><br/><b>Other awesome stuff</b><br/><br/>Dreamation has a lot to offer beyond role-playing games. Every kind of gaming is represented there. You can probably play poker, if you want to. There are LARPs and wargames and card games and strategy games and fun family-type games and everything under the sun. I think there's usually a place to watch anime and other videos. There's a room full of chocolate for a couple hours on one evening. Check the schedule, look around, and try new things.<br/><br/>At some point, someone (in the past, it was usually Jason Morningstar) may come to you with a video camera and ask you to say, "Hi, I'm ____. One cool thing I saw at Dreamation was ____." If you're like me, you freeze in the moment and make a fool of yourself. You will call it GenCon instead of Dreamation. You will forget to say your name or maybe say someone else's name. You will forget what was cool. No one really cares. They just want to hear that you had fun. <br/><br/><b>Less awesome stuff</b><br/><br/>Confluenza. Hundreds of gamers. Small, cramped spaces. Table spaces that don't get wiped down much. Winter cold season. Shaking hands with new friends. Wearing oneself down with constant activity, poor eating habits, and little sleep. Very likely, you will catch a cold or something worse. <br/><br/>Do whatever you can to reduce the chance of that happening (for yourself and others). Wash your hands often. Cough into your sleeve or shoulder instead of your hands, if you can. Rest as much as you can. Drink fluids. Get plenty of vitamin C and zinc. I believe in the power of Zicam as a cold preventative, but you may not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360471/#Comment_360471" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-18T20:01:11+00:00" title="February 18, 2012  8:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 7:26AM by Todd_L.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think anybody yet mentioned that you can also just skip pre-reg and, Anytime During The Con, add your name wherever there's an empty slot (or waiting-list space) for any game.

Plenty of good games will have open slots. You can just add your name to the wall signup sheet for that game.<br/><br/>2. Even in full games, plenty of people drop out. Check out the wall sheets for any games you couldn't get into in case someone crossed off their name. I've also seen people add their names to full games as alternates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360529/#Comment_360529" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T09:17:48+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  9:17AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You definitely need a badge for the dealer's room.

I will try to re-familiarize myself with the AW rules ahead of time, but forgive me if I'm not completely up to speed when I hit the table.  It's been a while, both in terms of playing the game (via IRC) and roleplaying in general.  By the time I get to you I will have either acquitted myself well in six games or completely crashed and burned.  Or perhaps some combination of both.  We'll see.\n<blockquote>Or you might be in Misspent Youth at midnight, in which case say what you want, I plan to fall asleep in the middle of running that one.</blockquote>\nNo midnight games for me, thanks.  It's going to be enough of a trial for me to stay up until twelve three nights in a row, given that my usual bedtime is eight o'clock.

Because of the little one, my wife still won't be able to play anything, but at least now she has the run of the place.

Truth be told, my biggest concern about playing this weekend isn't so much the <i>rules</i> as it is the techniques necessary to give good game.  When I hit the table Thursday night it'll be the first real session of tabletop roleplaying I've had since 2001, notwithstanding a couple of abortive attempts with family.  I am quite nervous.\n<blockquote>Also, you won't be the only family there!

She is not convinced of her ability to roleplay well without the distance of a computer screen, and though I've tried to convince her otherwise, I've been so caught up in my own gaming neuroses that I haven't been the best advocate for tabletop play as I could be.

I didn't see many red-colored games on the schedule, so I don't think things are full yet. Don't forget to list several alternatives for each slot.<br/>From what I've been told, it's worthwhile to submit your name ahead of time at whatever point because the games don't automatically fill up right away.  I'm not sure how "alternates" slots work, or if that's connected to the pre-registration process, but it's at least worth asking.<br/><br/>And then there's the "sign up on the day" approach, which many seem to use.  If it works, it works, and maybe <i>that's</i> where alternates come in.  It's tough to say, as I have no experience with this at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361585/#Comment_361585" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T05:42:17+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  5:42AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll have 3 or 4 copies of carry. to sell on site.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361594/#Comment_361594" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T06:18:09+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  6:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, but do we get $7 off?

I'm not feeling too great myself, so either we all ate something we shouldn't have or we have the same strain of something that's coming to a head this weekend.<br/><br/>Anyway, thank you for everyone who recommended Dreamation to me.  I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it next year and barring unforeseen circumstances, I may be among the veterans yet again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362786/#Comment_362786" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T18:06:35+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  6:06PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam!, don't forget that if you don't want to wait a year you can head to Dexcon in July!

Doesn't make me feel less guilty for missing the other three, but at least I was able to get <i>something</i> accomplished before everything kinda-sorta went to heck.  I slept 15 hours on my first night back and my son's still running a fever this morning, so I'm thinking we just got unlucky in the timing and the incubation period of whatever we've got just happened to end at the wrong time.  Walking around in the rain looking for food on Friday afternoon/evening probably didn't help matters any.<br/><br/>How does Dexcon stack up to Dreamation in terms of size, games, etc.?
