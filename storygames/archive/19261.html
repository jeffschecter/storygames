I was going to make combat fast, fun, exciting and tactical.  That way, we could RP for like 30 minutes, do an enjoyable combat for about 60 minutes, then get back to RP (our typical game structure) for the rest of the session with possibly a 2nd very short combat (15 minutes) in there somewhere. I wanted to separate out "crunch" from RP, so things like race, origin, personality are not part of character creation. (Elves don't get +2 dex). <br/><br/>I... I created a monster. <br/><br/>I got everything I wanted out of combat. RP is dead.  It's like without hard lists to choose from, my players have lost all direction. People no longer pick out character quirks, wax poetic about their backstory or any of that. Every player has become a carbon copy of each other except in purpose. Think the board game Descent. It's like Numeria, except instead of _____ _____ who ____, players have been stripped down to just a (warrior, mage or thief). What's interesting is I play with a bunch of people who do a RP heavy larp that's ruleset mostly is about combat, so structure-less RP is their forte.  <br/><br/>I've been modifying my formula for this over the past few months, but I wanted to know what you think?

So even if there aren't modifiers, you should consider making the players write this info down and refer back to it in play Surely, race or origin must be useful in any logistics phase - "You're an elf, your racial affinity for bows gives you the edge when buying new weapons for the team," and so on.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429057/#Comment_429057" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T07:51:42+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  7:51AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can still have RP things without crunch...and still have them impact the game.

I'd carefully prep grabby situations, but players would just bomb into scenes, drive uncreatively for a conflict roll, and then flog the conflict mechanics. And they'd admit during and afterwards that they weren't having fun, because they weren't getting into their characters or roleplaying at all, but they also couldn't stop themselves from being consumed by engagement with the conflict system. The problem was because the human brain is cued to look for patterns and figure them out, and the conflict mechanics were a pattern they couldn't ignore. I never solved the problem with that game. I ended up creating a different game that solved it -- it's called The Clay That Woke. Essentially, what you have to do is extend the pattern of the conflict system out into the roleplaying. The Clay That Woke has outputs from the conflict system that impact the roleplaying, and things players can roleplay to affect their options in the conflict system.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429067/#Comment_429067" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T09:10:00+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  9:10AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and in case I wasn't completely clear, it's not about the sketchiness of the player characters at all. Starting characters in The Clay That Woke have very few characteristics that distinguish them from each other. They don't even have names. What's important is the way you connect outputs from the conflict system to the roleplayed fiction, and inputs from roleplayed events to the conflict system.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429071/#Comment_429071" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T12:23:47+00:00" title="March  3, 2014 12:23PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You can still have RP things without crunch...and still have them impact the game.

It isn't necessarily tied to something about your character, so much as individual player interest.<br/><br/>In practice, of course, it often is tied to a character quality. If your character is a sailor, than you'll likely end up as the go-to person with authority over questions involving things nautical.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429107/#Comment_429107" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-04T12:50:35+00:00" title="March  4, 2014 12:50PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            three adjectives are actually enough character background, so a class, a race and another word actually can imply a lot about the character that can be interpretated by the player in several different ways. At least one of those three words should relate the character to a group.
