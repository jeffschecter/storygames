                    Right, this idea has been brewing for a while and I thought it deserved it's own thread.  I'd like to discuss here ways women are powerful in games, gaming, and the gaming community (as characters, as players, as people).  I started thinking about it when I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=479&amp;page=3#Item_48" rel="nofollow"> posted a story</a>  in the really long gender thread about making my male players cringe and twinge by pulling out the female gun and firing hard (go to the third page; it's about a quarter to a third of the way down).<br/><br/>What gave me this power (aside from being the GM)?  Well, I think no small part of it was that I was a woman, acting as one stereotype of woman and expecting the man to be telepathic.  This made all the players go "holy fucking shit!" and start back pedalling faster than you could snap.  There are strong reactions men have to women and that gives women power in any situation (if they choose to use it) but also in gaming relations.<br/><br/>For example, I have a hunch that a woman could get into a game that was considered "full" but a man couldn't.  (Okay, all you indie equality folks, *you* may not do it, but think of the group playing D&amp;D at the next table....)  A female gamer can also walk into a room and instantly command the attention of every single male (who are probably all going OMG boobies!).<br/><br/>As characters, women can also be powerful role models, even leaders, using men and losing them at their whim.  If they want to turn on the charm.<br/><br/>However, one thing I've noticed in writing this up, it's all related to relationships and sex.  Why is that?  Can anyone think of other ways women are empowered in gaming?<br/><br/>--Nancy                </div>

I find your examples bothersome because they all assume that the gaming table will be made up of straight desperate men who fall over themselves at the sight of a woman.<br/>
<br/>
At 13, some examples you mentioned might have gone down as you described 'em.<br/>
<br/>
And at some tables to this day those examples probably still have truth in them.<br/>
<br/>
But none of your examples strike me as empowerment as I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Bitches in the Vineyard, mentioned in the thread linked above, sounds awesome and I pray for an Actual Play post.<br/>

                            Judd, you're right about my assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
As for "empowerment", perhaps that's the wrong word.  I was more looking for situations in which women have more power than men.  We've spent a lot of time discussing ways in which it's unbalanced the other way (in favour of men) and so now I'm wondering about ways in which it's unbalanced towards women.<br/>

                            Judd, <br/><br/>Empowerment is where you find power and ability to bring change to a situation, so Nancy's comments are all about kinds of empowerment, even if they aren't the kind we'd most want to see. How well they'd work in any given group is, as you say, open to question. In many groups I see playing at the FLGS? Oh hell, they'd fall on the floor. In most groups I play with? Not so much, but we're all in our 30s, many have kids, and are almost all married for years. <br/><br/>So, as you both note, sex and relationship have made up all too much of the assumed toolset of female gamers. Not that I find anything wrong with either, inherently. Its just that when that's all you can count on it's a rather sad state of afairs. Not to mention that with time and tide those things can fade or grow dysfunctional. <br/><br/>I also have to note that those elements are also not unique to women once you get past a situation where a room full of straight boys is the norm*. I've played in heavily female populated games where men used their sexuality and relationship skills to get attention, power, and control from the women. It is, admitedly, less common -- but the more gender equality we see the more likely it is to happen. <br/><br/>The thing about the issue of female power at the table is that I have a hard time thinking of things that women do that men don't do as well. I've seen a lot of powerful women at gaming tables, who are able to have power and respect in their games, but their methods aren't all that much different than those many men use.<br/><br/>Now, they may use them in different proportions: I know more women who are good at high-cooperative play and more guys who are better at high-competition play. But I do know members of both sexes who do both, and who are very good at both. So while I could maybe make some weak claims about tendancies, I can't say anything certain or strong or all that powerfully female off the top of my head. <br/><br/>The one thing that I can say, with some degree of confidence, is that <b>on average</b> and by a slight margin most women I play with are more comfortable at expessing and playing with higher degrees of emotionality then men are. And I don't mean "strength or depth of emotional intensity" so much as "ability to show, visably and vulnerably demonstrate, and then play and replay upon that emotionality." In many forms of Nar play and Immersionist technique heavy play, those abilities can be used to garner a lot of respect because they can bring an intensity, focus, and honesty to the table that is harder (not impossible) for many men to get at. <br/><br/>I suppose this ties into Matt Willson's statement that "I think the world I live in is more accepting of a woman who's both badass and emotionally expressive than of a man in the same role." So in games in which emotional intensity and involvement is a desired and rewarded element, women could well use that ability/socially granted power/whatever for them. <br/><br/>Of course, that leads into issues of the way that many gamers activly reject and mock emotional engagement with game or story, and the ways in which that interacts with gender rolls.... but I'm not sure I'm ready to tackle that while I'm packing for yet another long trip. <br/><br/>Nancy, did I say anything helpful at all?<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Though it is the norm in the vast majority of groups I've ever seen, even today.                        </div>

                            Yes, Brand, that was helpful, and is exactly what I'm trying to dig at.  I hadn't really embraced the emotionality aspect, since I play almost entirely with men and it just doesn't come up as often because the games tend to focus on things other than emotion -- as you pointed out.  Is this a problem?  Should more games focus on emotional elements (not as an equalising measure, but to fill a missing niche)?  What does the lack of these say?<br/>
<br/>
for reference, I think I've played in exactly two sex-balanced games in my life.  The rest I'm usually the only woman.  With large-group gatherings, the ratio is usually around 5:1 or 6:1 men:women, so pretty standard to what someone mentioned Forge Midwest was.  That being said, are there more women in the indie game scene?  Why do you think this is?<br/>

                            Nancy, <br/><br/>I don't think games should focus on anything, really. Games that are all cerebral (all T) are good too -- so long as that's actually what the players want. <br/><br/>But, I have seen a lot of dysfunction around games and emotionality. I have a couple players (male) in my group who to this day -- even after all our social contract and openness and all that kind of talk -- CANNOT openly identify when they are having emotional reactions to a game. The ability to do so was beaten out of them by old groups, in which (from their descriptions of it) they were pretty much emotionally screwed by the group and then made fun of if they had any visable emotional reaction. They would then do it to others in turn, in a kind of cycle of abuse. <br/><br/>Now that kind of crap is screwed up and not normal. But even in my (relativly) healthy RPGing life I remember a lot of times in my teens where we'd get games where someone was deeply into the game on on agenda or another (sometimes a lot of pride in a gamsit game, often a lot of emotional investment in a nar-style game) and when things went badly for them and they reacted with tears or swearing or any "lack of cool" we would rag them blue. "It was just a game", we'd howl, while secretly denying that we'd been just as invested a moment before, "don't be a baby! Yea, don't be a baby girl!" <br/><br/>Because you should be playing these games where you invest yourself, your self esteme, your emotional intensity, and your intimate connection to the game's fiction. But in so doing you should NEVER EVER actually commit the horrible sin of expressing the way you really feel in any way that could make others uncomfortable or reveal yourself to be anything other than cool, controlled, and on top of it. So you know, get REALLY into the game, but don't get into the game in any way that actually touches you. <br/><br/>::sigh::<br/><br/>Anyway, that's rarer these days. However, even in a lot of game circles these days, and on the more indie-edge, I see occasional degrees of shying away from emotional investment and obvious emotional reaction to game. People speak in very academic terms, speak about the process of creating and experiencing fiction as though they were the fiction's critics rather than its creators, and shy away from moments of emotional vulnerability in order to retain logical control while describing emotionally processes. As <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=51#2" rel="nofollow">Chris put it</a>, there is a "gamer shame about real emotional connection at the table."<br/><br/>Now there are a lot of groups who are starting to deliberatly reject that. To strive for emotionality and real engagment and connection in their games. It's in those games that I think women may have some level of power or advantage, as many of them didn't get as damaged as say... I did.                        </div>

                            So, is it accurate to say that women have a better handly on emotion than men?  That women are more aware of their own emotions?  more in control?  more able to express them?  more able to manipulate others' emotions?  better able to interpret other characters' emotions?  Another angle: do you think women supply both halves of an emotional interaction in-game?  i.e. that they substitute what the other player is failing to convey properly?   Do male players do the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
On a meta level, do you think women are more emotionally invested in their characters and the game?<br/>
<br/>
What emotions, specifically, do you see women having more power or control over?<br/>

                            I wouldn't say that women are essentially better at emotionality than men. I think women in our culture are less strongly conditioned against expressing emotionality than men are, and so have an easier time, on average only, at expressing a broad range of public emotions in healthy and normative ways. <br/><br/>This probably does include some degree of empathy and such, but that is actually a seperate issue. I know too many men who are excellent cold readers and manipulators to speak of it in the same way as the expression part. <br/><br/>So, I don't know tha women have more power or control over any specific emotion, but I think they have greater comfort in expressing and handling publicly expressed emotions, which can give them a confidence and saftey zone in hard core edge play that many (not all) men might lack.                        </div>

                            Nancy, I've seen and enjoyed the same sort of status when I played on a variety of online games where I was one of the few men playing.  In my less-than-ethical days, I could and would wind the other players around my finger to get what I wanted.  So while I'm sure that what you describe occurs (I've seen it), I think it's more a function of context than it is of essentialist sexuality.                        </div>

For example, I played a female character on a MUD for a while, and I similarly had various players who would play up to me.  I've never had a majority of gay gamers in a group, but enough that I can easily picture the same dynamic in an all-male or all-female group.  Desirability and emotional manipulation are forms of power.                        </div>

<code> That's an interesting point, Josh, and perhaps you're right. Does this seem true to other folks? That perhaps the people in gamer-circles who are in the minority have some emotional weight they can use?</code><br/><br/>Nancy,<br/><br/>I think that is a definite "yes".   I am normally the only female in the groups I play in.  I'm also the only bisexual player too (currently in my group).  I am sure subconsciouly, I have used those points to my advantage in game.  Even today.  Even though I try not to.  I know for a fact I have used them to my advantage previously.  <br/><br/>(Heck, when I was selling cell phones I did it all the time.  When my sales were low, so was my neckline.)   <br/><br/>Years ago, I made a point of swindling the hell out of a bunch of guys who were playing the CCG, Magic: The Gathering.  (We're talking back in 1994.)  I heard them talking about how their girlfriends were no good at such a game because they were female.  I raised an eyebrow and kept looking and listening, and began plotting.  I saw a few cards they had that I wanted and so I sauntered up and asked if I could play too.  They wrinkled their noses at me but allowed me to sit and play once they saw my deck.  (This is when you still played for ante.)  I lost.  All three rounds I played.  But I had planned it that way.  I would stick my bottom lip out at my 'loss' and ask to play another round and they would agree.  It was a shitty deck that could barely hold it's own.  But I used it anyway so that they would be comfortable with me so that when I pulled out my fighting deck, I would trounce them.  And I did.  Every round after that.  Just tore those guys up.  I took my winnings, laughed and left the table.  I know they let me play because they thought they could beat me easily because I was a female and heck, they had just been talking about how females were no good at the game.  And I led them on thinking they could.  I remember that was the same exact day and store where Eric and a friend of ours named Mike, walked up and bought some single cards and the guy charged them the list price (like $5 a card).  When I walked up and asked for the same cards, I was charged $1 a card.  Eric and Mike were so floored, they gave me their money, a list of the cards they wanted and I went in and bought them.  <br/><br/>There was a long time I was proud of that day.  <br/><br/>But back to the point, I think it's actually a subconscious thing.  No matter how much we fight it, we remember that we were raised to 'act' certain ways around the opposite sex no matter if they have a differing sexual orientation or not.  Gay men are still men.  My mother raised me that all men are evil, horrible creatures and should never be trusted.  (Yes guys, those were her words... sorry about that.  I'm glad I was able to realize that she was wrong though when I was very, very young.)  But you see, that was pounded (and I mean pounded) into my head for many, many years.   When you're 12 years old and trying to play some Battletech in a room of six other people (all guys), it's hard to not pay attention to what your mother has pounded into your head your entire life and thus, I remember acting differently.   And I know they treated me differently than they treated each other as a result of -my- actions/reactions towards them.   It was a viscious cycle.  <br/><br/>Now that I'm married, in my 30's and have a much broader gaming knowledge (and life knowledge) under my belt, I wonder if that was something I did ( and those guys did) just because of their age and inexperience with life as a whole.  *shrug*  I think very differently than I did when I was 12.  Or 16.  Or even 21.  <br/><br/>And after all that blathering, I'd say Jankai is right:  "Empowerment is about doing something for yourself, not doing something to get a reaction."  Never truer words spoken.<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

                            Brand--<br/><br/><i>But even in my (relativly) healthy RPGing life I remember a lot of times in my teens where we'd get games where someone was deeply into the game on on agenda or another (sometimes a lot of pride in a gamsit game, often a lot of emotional investment in a nar-style game) and when things went badly for them and they reacted with tears or swearing or any "lack of cool" we would rag them blue. "It was just a game", we'd howl, while secretly denying that we'd been just as invested a moment before, "don't be a baby! Yea, don't be a baby girl!" </i><br/><br/><br/>I find this challenging (in a good way).  I feel like there ought to be a distinction between the sort of thing where you soothe someone with the "relax, it's just a game" and the "don't be a baby" name calling.  I don't tolerate it well because it seems more like infantile emotion than mature emotion, the sort that feeds the game.  More often than not, the underlying current of it in my experience is "I throw tantrum now" not "wow, I'm so touched by that I cry." <br/><br/>To bring this round to the question of the place of a woman at the table--I have found that I tolerate cursing and pouting less from male players when there is a female player at the table.  Why?  Well, because I have found that more than a few female players respond to that sort of cursing and pouting as a threat (and honestly, at some level, I do too).  The woman at the table does not look to the cursing male as "oh, look how touched he is" but as "uh-oh, cursing is phase 1 of male aggression."   <br/><br/>Here is an assumption that I think lies behind this talk: Teenagers and young men frequently equate any emotion with femininity, in fact, with 'baby girl' cry baby femininity.  It's always bothered me, then, when later on we mistake the immature cry-baby reactions of men for some genuine emotional maturity (which women do seem to develop more quickly on average).<br/><br/>Does that distinction hold water?  I'm thinking, too, if there might be a better way through the (not-good) pouty response than "back away from the table."                        </div>
