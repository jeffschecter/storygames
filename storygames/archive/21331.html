What if instead this idea were turned about? What if the difficulty of a task were set, then the circumstances adjudicated to match the difficulty? In particular, the idea of the GM rolling dice to determine difficulty, then narrating the circumstances that cause a task to match the difficulty.<br/><br/>For example, let us say the players wish to climb a mountain for whatever reason. The GM would normally say, "It's a DC 20 climb check because the path is icy and there's driving wind." To reverse this methodology: the GM rolls a die or dice, tallies them, and the result is DC 20. The GM then says, "The climb will be unusually difficult for you because the paths are icy and there's driving wind." A post-hoc justification for the difficulty.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I see this less satisfying than the traditional methodology, but this could certainly have some applications. Randomizing NPC moods, randomizing weather conditions, randomizing the individual strength of monsters, randomizing the impact of certain traits (Joe's a drunkard, let's roll to find out the DC of talking him into helping you, and we'll see if he's drunk, feeling a bit tipsy, hungover, etc.).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467074/#Comment_467074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T17:55:37+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  5:55PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's how it works in many progressive (as in, non-traditional) games.

Two big, fat examples from <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> would be random encounter checks and NPC reaction rolls: both of those apply a simple random distribution to derive an outcome case-by-case, and then ask the GM to justify the event in fictional terms.<br/><br/>A perhaps more subtle foundational example is the saving throw: there is a formal target number that disregards the circumstances pretty much entirely, and once we've found out whether the character saves or not, we justify the result in narration by adding necessary detail.<br/><br/>In other words: you're right, and the procedure you suggest is used pretty much as you describe it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467075/#Comment_467075" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T18:53:55+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  6:53PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm understanding the premise correctly, the approach I advocate in a fully-GM'd game of <i>DayTrippers</i> is an example of this.  In service to building tension in a dramatic narrative arc, the GM is advised to let the difficulty of obstacles and conflicts be guided by the party's current position in the narrative, rather than by the "organic" properties of the obstacle/combatant itself.  The relative ease or difficulty of any given encounter can easily be modulated, and that modulation can be justified impromptu with declaratives of fictional positioning, number of combatants, surprise, convenient or inconvenient circumstance, etc.<br/><br/>Thus, in a typical session arc with three challenges (which we might consider "plot beats"), the first might be adjudicated to about 1/2 of the party's Total Character Value, the second at 3/4, and the third at the party's full TCV.  Note that this is *regardless* of what exactly the encounter is, or in what order the potential obstacles are encountered.  Even the very same obstacle can be modulated and remodulated, making it more difficult the second or third time.<br/><br/>The intended result is a ramping up of tension as the emergent story unfolds, increasing the challenges faced by the players in much the same way as a traditional fiction writer increases the challenges faced by the main character in a short story or TV episode, until reaching the climactic scene which tests the hero to the full extent of their mettle.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467076/#Comment_467076" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T19:02:48+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  7:02PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2017 7:06PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That's how it works in many progressive (as in, non-traditional) games.

Here's a simple run-down of the terminology as I like to use it:<br/><br/>A <b>formal</b> game element is something that exists as an artificial structure defined by formal declaration (rules, in other words - the players agree together that this thing exists). Examples of formal elements include things like procedural rules, character stats and any other elements of the game state that are, well, defined formally. Formal elements are often symbolized and tracked with physical knick-knacks like playing pieces or character sheets or whatnot, but let's not get confused by that - the real game-thing is the abstract idea of a Strength score, not the penciled-in number in a piece of paper.<br/><br/>A <b>real</b> game element is something that exists independent of formal definition. Some games have negligible real elements, but in rpgs they interestingly play a rather important role: in general the things the players actually say to each other, and the shared fiction they imagine, are all real in this sense. Other real yet nevertheless existing things are feelings, etiquette, strategic notions, etc.<br/><br/>(I'll note here that yes, calling something "real" this way may come to sound insane as a terminological choice, considering that we're actually mostly working with explicitly fictional things. I have bad rpg theorist justifications for this, but the reality is probably that it would be much less confusing if I just called these concepts "mechanics" and "fiction"; we're basically discussing the way mechanics and fiction of a roleplaying game relate to each other.)<br/><br/>A roleplaying game fundamentally acts as a formal framework that enforces player evaluation of real ideas to produce formal ideas, and vice versa. For example, a game where the GM decides when your character is dead requires the GM to act as an interpreter between the real idea of death in a narrative, and the formal, official status of being dead in mechanical terms. It may be considered quite interesting that there is apparently no way to transfer real game-state into formal game-state, or vice versa, without having a player act as the <b>medium</b> of interpretation: somebody needs to decide what it looks like in the fiction when the hit points fall to zero, and somebody needs to decide what it means in the mechanics when your character falls into a pool of lava. It's sort of the is-ought problem of rpg ontology, if you will [grin].<br/><br/>Moving on, we can characterize different roleplaying game procedures in terms of what kind of activity they induce in the formal and real elements of the game. This is an useful perspective on certain types of game design, just as we're seeing in how Valyrian underwent a perspective shift regarding task resolution: it is indeed possible to run task resolution procedures "in either direction" (from fiction to mechanics, or vice versa), and it's often very useful to be aware of both possibilities.<br/><br/>When we categorize the different types of game actions in terms of the formal/real divide, it becomes possible to distinguish and label four fundamentally different activities:<br/><b>* Abstract</b> game procedures are those that function strictly in the space of formal activity. Rolling the dice and comparing them to a score on the character sheet is an abstract activity, for example, because at no point of the procedure are you required to consider the fictional elements of the game to do it.<br/><b>* Narrative</b> game procedures are the opposite, they are things that do not formally "do anything" to the game state. For example, when the player of an adventure game describes their character as having a big fancy hat, that's often a merely narrative action (assuming that they do not need to make note of the hat on the character sheet, of course, or pay for it in formally distinct currency).<br/><b>* Formal</b> or <b>oracular</b> game procedures are ones that take elements of the formal game state and impact the real (by which we mean fictional - remember the brain disease) state. For example, looking at a chart and concluding that the next skill challenge should be "Hard", and therefore describing an imposing wall that would be challenging to climb, is an oracular activity: the player is mandated to impact the shared fiction by a formal rule.<br/><b>* Organic</b> or <b>realistic</b> procedures are the opposite of formal ones, as they instead require a player to "read" the real game state (the fiction of the roleplaying game, most often) to gauge and deliver formal facts. For example, a GM who declares a notionally pre-existing monster to be "Large" as a formal size category in D&amp;D is acting organically.<br/><br/>Formal and organic game procedures are very important to roleplaying games due to the nature of the medium, and particularly because they're generally speaking the <i>difficult</i> and <i>interesting</i> things in a game: abstract procedures are just boardgaming, when all's said and done, and narrative procedures are just playing cops and robbers - both <i>are</i> legit activities, but there are reasons for why rules-based roleplaying is such a dominant paradigm among people who actually make a hobby of it.<br/><br/>It may be of interest that when I worked on this stuff sometime in 2006 or so, I was inspired by a disillusionment with "oracular" storytelling games - that is, games that feature weak or no organic procedures at all. This terminology enabled me to verbalize my issues with that kind of game, and construct a bit of a theory on how a powerful roleplaying game needs to form a significant iterative feedback loop between the formal and real elements via a well-considered symphony of formal and organic mechanics. No matter how formal you want to go, a legit rpg <b>must</b> have those crucial moments where the players actually judge their fiction in organic terms; you can reduce those moments in number and clarify them - think <i>My Life with Master</i> as a case study - but ultimately that just makes the remaining moments of organic judgement that much more important.<br/><br/>As I indicated earlier, this is all just a different nomenclature for Lumpley's well-known cloud-box-arrow thing from years back (even his conclusions were similar, I think); the only reason for my using a different terminology is that we were working on this stuff independent of each other at the time, and I sort of got stuck in my own terminological rabbit hole as a consequence [grin].<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings" title="rhysmakesthings"><img alt="rhysmakesthings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings">rhysmakesthings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467083/#Comment_467083" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-18T00:09:03+00:00" title="October 18, 2017 12:09AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoy systems that do this, one of the things that annoys me when dming traditional games is having to set these target numbers on the fly. Deciding on a numeric representation of difficulty is not something that is intuitive to reason about and, since as a GM i have complete knowledge of the characters stats, when I make a call like this i'm directly dictating the odds that the character(s) can succeed which to me feels like one step away from just doing away with the resolution system and deciding everything on gm fiat.<br/><br/>I think the important thing, for me, is making the "difficulty" easy to reason about.<br/><br/>As to the randomly rolled difficulty, it certainly makes things easy to reason about since you're just justifying the difficulty that you're given. However, I wonder whether fixed difficulty might be more straightforward version of the same thing and how much the randomly determined difficulty adds. <br/><br/>Randomly determined difficulty on a d20 (as in your example) is essentially an opposed roll of d20's, which means a flat 52.5% chance of success with no bonuses on average. Would it be better to just use that fixed base percent chance of success like you would in PbtA and other games? I suppose the advantage you get from this technique is as an improv aid like reaction rolls and random encounter checks that Eero mentioned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467086/#Comment_467086" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-18T01:53:49+00:00" title="October 18, 2017  1:53AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2017 1:55AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think leaving "How hard is this?" to the dice rather than the GM is often a good call.<br/><br/>In some games, coming up with a reason for the difficulty after the roll establishes it might be just right!

If success is assured due to fictional position, why roll the dice? In the latter example, the debt that is owed provides a fictional position that demands compliance with the PCs. In contrast, however, there is nothing to guarantee that their request can be honored in the way that the PCs desire. A player-facing option ("roll to Persuade") seems insufficient in such a scenario.<br/><br/>One might even expand the variable difficulty in certain ways...roll 1d10 for terrain and 1d10 for weather, but in the winter months, roll 2d6 for both, then establish the fiction, then allow players to react to it. One could even assume dice-adjacent mechanics based on this generation of conditions, the dice generating, for instance, words and phrases that dictate the fiction. Roll 1d6, on a roll of 1, the path is "well-trod and maintained," but a 6 it is "arduous and unkempt," and these conditions could be extrapolated further from there: on a roll of 1 during the winter months, the path is "traversed frequently, with visible footprints in the tamped-down snow," while a 6 indicates it is "icy and laden with snowdrifts."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467096/#Comment_467096" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-18T21:19:03+00:00" title="October 18, 2017  9:19PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just noticed I've been using both formal and organic approaches in a 50/50 proportion as a GM for as long as I can remember. <br/><br/>I'd like to add that coming up with DCs of course feels and it's wrong to do totally on a whim.

We want mechanical challenge to reflect fictional positioning. (So that fictional description and player choices all have an impact on outcomes.)<br/><br/>I don't see how randomizing a DC is helpful here. (But maybe there's something I haven't considered.)<br/><br/>2. We want success to be uncertain - there to be randomness in which actions succeed and which actions fail.<br/><br/>In most games with task resolution, we are already rolling for success randomly, so adding *another* roll to establish "DC" does not give us any added value. The procedure is already random, after all.<br/><br/>The GM setting DCs randomly is basically an opposed roll, which doesn't change the math significantly. (You can just redesign the task resolution check to be more highly random, if that's the desired outcome.)<br/><br/>(I suppose there might be an exception if the game you're using includes many opportunities to retry tasks and you occasionally want some to be impossible - outside the range of possible skill checks, for example - but these are oddball side cases.)<br/><br/>Generally you're better off with a static DC for all rolls if this is your goal.<br/><br/>3. We want to leverage some random or "oracular" tools to decide things about the fiction, or to help us decide things or help us narrate details.<br/><br/>This is what David is doing in his posted examples, and I would say that he's doing so in a better way than a straight up random roll. <br/><br/>If I want fictional inspiration, it's much more interesting to roll for whether it's snowing that day than just roll to set a random DC. Skip the middle man, in other words.<br/><br/>This is kind of how Reaction Rolls work in old school D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Here, the roll is providing us with inspiration to narrate things a certain way and helping us create fiction. (Notably, before resolution - if we want inspiration for how things go, we already have the resolution check, after all.)<br/><br/>4. We want difficulties to ramp up or down or otherwise create some kind of progression.<br/><br/>This is usually not well served by randomness, although there could still be hybrid cases (for instance, write down seven different DCs on cards, and then draw them in order as you play; then you're guaranteed to have one particular difficult task per session or whatever).<br/><br/>This one is tricky, though; what is the intended goal?<br/><br/>If it's to create a dramatic arc, this might not be the right approach. In stories, we feel a rising level of challenge/tension throughout, but I see designers misinterpreting what this means regularly.<br/><br/>However, the actual common outcome in such a story is the opposite: the protagonists struggle through early challenges but almos inevitably succeed in the end. This means that, if anything, DCs should drop as the game progresses. (I don't know if this the case in your game, Tod!)<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the desired situation is that getting to the end of the road successfully is difficult and rarely succeeds, a series of identical challenges which must all succeed (like a long string of coin flips) is better and simpler.<br/><br/>There are many different angles here, and all worth considering,                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467140/#Comment_467140" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-20T23:49:17+00:00" title="October 20, 2017 11:49PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, Paul.  It's true that by increasing the actual DL as the climax approaches in <i>DayTrippers</i>, I am mechanically making success <i>less</i> likely.  In other words, it is not the "success arc" that I'm modeling, but rather the <i>tension and risk</i> experienced by the players.  Another way of putting this is that I'm modeling the subjective <i>experience</i> of the protagonists, rather than the <i>outcome</i> of the traditional narrative arc.  This is a "Simulationist" approach - not to fictional "reality", but to the protagonists' sense of the narrative construct as viewed from within.<br/><br/>There are a couple factors at play here, part illusion and part woo.  Firstly, as you may know from my statements elsewhere, the DayTrippers CORE system depends a lot on "psychic content" and one of its guiding values is <i>Bleed</i>.  I find that the propensity for outbound Bleed tends to increase as tension and stakes increase, creating a feedback loop between diegetic and non-diegetic actions and effects.<br/><br/>Secondly and related to the above, I am a firm believer in dice magic, having seen it work so well for so many years.  I can't explain how it works scientifically, but it does seem to play out that increased tension somehow increases the likelihood of surprisingly advantageous real-world effects (such as the outcomes of dice rolls).<br/><br/>Finally (and this is where the "illusion" comes in), I hedge my bets by constructing the probability arc in such a way that while earlier challenges are easier to overcome - notice that the curve described above is 1:2, 3:4, 1:1, meaning that the final challenge actually has about a 50/50 chance of success (i.e. "balanced") - but the relative ease of the earlier challenges can be easily masked by fictional positioning and description.  Again, here I am prioritizing subjective effects over mechanical odds.  There are a few techniques that can be used to pull off this illusion.  It's a bit long to quote here, so instead I'll link to an excerpt from the <i>DayTrippers GameMasters Guide: </i><br/><a href="http://daytrippersrpg.com/sites/default/files/tension.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://daytrippersrpg.com/sites/default/files/tension.pdf</a><br/><br/>Let me make clear:  I don't expect (nor advocate) that this approach would be equally useful in every RPG.  It works for <i>DayTrippers</i> because of the design goals and values of this particular game.  It's kinda like Hunter S. Thompson said, "I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467141/#Comment_467141" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T02:02:41+00:00" title="October 21, 2017  2:02AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf" rel="nofollow">AsIf</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>part woo ...

However, we don't need to get into a debate about magical thinking: what's interesting about this particular example is that it's equally relevant to randomized difficulty in RPG design.<br/><br/>Hypothetically speaking - at least to a scientifically-minded person - a typical "adventure" in Tod's described "three-tier difficulty" model should conclude in failure about 75.25% of the time (or 50% of the time, if only the final roll matters).<br/><br/>My guess is that, for most tables, this is far from desirable. So, how can you have high odds of failure and still have above-average success? This is where it gets interesting from a design standpoint, as Guy points out. That second bullet point in Guy's reply is a common technique, and quite effective.<br/><br/>What are other possibilities?<br/><br/>* False "difficulty". This is often seen in boardgames: the level of "difficulty" keeps rising, but so does some kind of positive - the resources or abilities of the players. Perhaps, if you're smart, you can collect special items or "bonus points" all through the game, and then cash them in on that final roll, for example. This still creates the *feeling* of tension and difficulty, but, in practice, your odds may be *better* than they were earlier in the game. In video games this might mean getting better weapons, or even just getting better at playing the game (e.g. hand-eye coordination). In D&amp;D it might be a question of saving most of your hit points for the final fight, and now finally being willing to put them on the line.<br/><br/>* "What are you willing to risk?" Somewhat related to the hit point example: in many "narrativist" designs, the player and/or character has the ability to accept compromises or sacrifice things the character values to increase the odds of success. Here, the real "cost" of a difficult challenge is to make the characters suffer, to ask them what they're willing to give up or wager in order to get a high probability of success after all. Maybe sacrificing your left arm doubles your odds of success, and putting your lover's life on the line gives you another +10; you pile these up until you get your success.<br/><br/>* Looking for clever tricks and optimizing your odds. In this game, there are many ways to get bonuses to your attempt - find a way to roll a different skill/stat, get circumstance bonuses, or create a situation where many people can try. As difficulty rises, then, the players have to get more and more inventive or clever; eventually, their clever ideas overwhelm the apparent difficulty and they achieve high odds of success after all. For example, when an enemy's combat statistics become too hard to handle, the players have to conspire to poison him first, and then fight him in a specially prepared ambush location.<br/><br/>So, if and when you have randomized difficulty, as the OP posits, what is its purpose? Does it relate to any of these things? Of the categories we've mentioned:<br/><br/>* The players will make multiple attempts, until one succeeds (as per Guy's post). The challenge will take longer to play out, as tension mounts.<br/>* The players must accumulate resources during earlier play in order to face the challenge.<br/>* The player/character must make greater sacrifices or face greater risks in order to have a chance at success.<br/>* The players must use more and more wits/inventiveness/strategy to overcome a higher challenge.<br/><br/>If you like for challenges to vary in these ways, then changing the difficulty from situation to situation is a good thing. Now, *when* do you want it to vary? If it's at very specific times and places (e.g. the final encounter/scene), randomness will not serve you well. But if you like the idea that some situations require more or less of the above, then randomness could be a great idea.<br/><br/>I think these are also fruitful ideas to ponder as a designer.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467152/#Comment_467152" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T05:48:49+00:00" title="October 21, 2017  5:48AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you scientific prudes. I'm totally on board with the magic dice rpg theory, it's clearly a bold new direction to take in game development. Who's going to take the first step with a game that <i>really</i> puts this concept through its paces?<br/><br/>I'm imagining something like a boxed set game with dice included. There's three parcels of d6 dice in there - "normal", "cursed" and "shriven" dice respectively. (Separately packed, so they don't get to rub into each other, of course.) The game revolves around using these as bonus and penalty dice - whatever the rolls made in the game, you get your circumstance bonuses not as old-fashioned numerical additions or extra dice or such, but rather you'll replace normal dice in your pool with either negatively or positively charged magic dice.<br/><br/>For added benefit, the game could give the players options to express their metaphysical understanding: you can either take a +1 to your roll, or you get to swap a normal die (let's say it's a 2d6 roll or something) with a shriven magic die. This will keep the scientific minds happy, while the true believers know that they've got the advantage - after all, a 2d6 roll with one normal die and one shriven die is <i>obviously</i> better than 2d6+1 with normal dice!<br/><br/>Character advancement in this game should occur in two forms: on the one hand the players will need to develop their magic powers to grant them increased control over the dice, such as they are, and on the other hand your normal dice set gets to spend time in the same dice bag with shriven dice and appropriate healing crystals and other such fortune-enhancing knick-knacks. This elegant advancement scheme doesn't require any number-crunching or messing with the character sheet, as your play will just naturally improve session-by-session, as your dice improve, and you improve as a dice-roller as well. After a mere few months of play one may expect the players to consistently roll 10+ on 2d6 time after time, barring the unfortunate accident of having to roll with the dreaded cursed dice.<br/><br/>As I see it, the game basically writes itself, so the only real challenge here is the production aspect: how do you produce cursed and shriven dice efficiently enough? I suggest simply sourcing them from different manufacturers and imagining really hard that whichever batch arrives last is cursed. Perhaps the shriven dice could also have little halos next to the numbers to emphasize their saintly nature.<br/><br/>Best part: once you've solved the dice production issue, you can sell this same dice set to be used with Burning Wheel. That game makes much use of the concept of dice "shade", which is much more elegantly simulated by dice magic than the more conventional method of re-jiggering the target number. With cursed and shriven dice you can just keep the target number at three all the time, and just swap dice as necessary to get that same effect of increased efficacy per die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467153/#Comment_467153" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T05:49:03+00:00" title="October 21, 2017  5:49AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2017 5:50AM by AsIf.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup!

For example, I've often seen a series of lucky rolls by an enemy in an old-school dungeon crawl turn a "regular" foe into a hated villain. The PCs couldn't defeat that goblin? It must be a super-goblin!<br/><br/>If and when the GM takes that into account, giving the foe a fictional status ('super-goblin', 'goblin-in-chief'), and maybe even upgrading the foe's combat stats ("a super-goblin must have at least 5 Hit Dice, so let's change this part..."), then this is exactly what's happening. Oracular outcomes get integrated back into the fiction and the mechanics, creating a feedback loop.<br/><br/>I know that at least one video game has used this kind of "memory" to create "enemy bosses" - the more encounters with you they survive, the more dangerous they become, and the more likely you are to see them again.<br/><br/>Apparently (I haven't played the game in question) it works very well, and feels very organic.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467174/#Comment_467174" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-22T16:17:11+00:00" title="October 22, 2017  4:17PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man!

As a byproduct, the character gets even more hated by the players. It's not that just the dice failed them, it's "this stupid goblin that comes back more and more powerful each time!". But fumbles are kinda scarce sometimes. This could probably work better with an actual rule to guide NPC development with a bit more of chances of this happening.<br/><br/>Hmmm, maybe each failed roll of the players could add to a count for making the NPC survive/escape the scene for free and levelling up for the next? I mean, it's already hard to stage NPCs surviving battles, specially if they are minions, have a good motivation to remain in battle or no way to escape easily. However with this mechanic the GM could add wight to any justification for it or even ask the players collaboration to some extent.<br/><br/>So, like, players fail 5 attacks against this NPC, fumbles count twice; the Narrator can then make it escape the scene automatically, even if their side loses the battle and all the rest gets killed. It's up to everyone to collab with the narrative to make it possible: the PC who was about to kill it decides to be merciful instead, isn't sure if his last arrow actually killed it or maybe just wounded it badly, etc. Then it's up to the GM to bring that NPC back, powered up, after a couple of sessions, ready for revenge.<br/><br/>Needs further testing, but who knows?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467226/#Comment_467226" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T09:36:46+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  9:36AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So "failure clocks" basically?

NPC levels are rather arbitrary in sandbox play anyway, so adding the occasional level is well within the scope of the simulation.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467245/#Comment_467245" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T20:43:03+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  8:43PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2017 8:47PM by WarriorMonk.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, if the fiction allows for the NPC to escape, making it come back empowered is a given. I merely suggested linking that to fail forward because it's actually rare that players just let go an enemy. They will usually pursue them or keep draining their resources otherwise until it's dead.<br/><br/>But there might be more than one way for a character to make a comeback: there's magic, technology, it can come back as a ghost and possess others, etc. Also, I'm totally against keeping tabs on how many failed rolls has each NPC accumulated through the combat and I admit that giving the character a free escape is too much. <br/><br/>Let me rephrase the idea a bit: what if each failed roll is narrated as if the PC should have hit... but then the NPC reveals to have something that might make him special? It may start simple, like some uncanny lucky move or a particular trained trick. Perhaps a piece of their equipment isn't as common as it looks, perhaps he's a believer favoured by his god, just remembered the advice of his mentor or is copying another PCs moves.<br/><br/>If the character escapes, then it gets upgraded for the next encounter to match the PCs level, and his new abilities are now based on what happened at the last battle. Perhaps it learned magic, became a cleric or an specialist. If it got killed perhaps he gets raised as an undead, his older brother comes after the PCs looking for revenge, is brought back as a cyborg, etc.<br/><br/>The main thing here I think, is capitalizing on failed rolls and characters who are already remembered by the players, to obtain charged characters able to elicit more intense emotions from the players by triggering their memory. It's doable even with minions, as sometimes consecutive failed rolls give even more relevance to those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467271/#Comment_467271" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T22:35:44+00:00" title="October 26, 2017 10:35PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One simple way which would work is simply to grant NPCs or monsters "XP" or additional traits each time they appear "on screen". </p></div></blockquote>\nI basically use this method in my Nemezis System influenced vanilla fantasy campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467449/#Comment_467449" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-04T09:30:54+00:00" title="November  4, 2017  9:30AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2017 9:54AM by Rickard.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In all honesty, the die sets the difficulty, not the skill levels or DC.<br/><br/>This is more apparent in games like <b>RuneQuest</b>, where you roll against your skill. If rolling d20 under your skill, you succeed.<br/><br/>Normally, each player rolls a die. If the player got a skill of 12, and the die shows 14, then the die tells the player "This is too hard for your character. You needed a skill level of 14 or more".<br/><br/>If we expand on this, at any time several people would try to accomplish the same thing, the game master could roll a die. That would set the difficulty for the task. If any character has skill levels equal or above, then they would succeed.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In my first published game <b>Matin\xe9</b>, the player could describe whatever (with some restrictions), but unless the roll succeeded, the game master could give a counter description that nullified that explanation. The same thing applied in the opposite direction, and I used this a lot as a game master. Here are two examples I fondly remember from when we playtested the game.<br/><br/>Me: "The guy throws you out of window in the tower". [Rolled failed]<br/>Player: "I grab hold of one of the vines on the tower wall, and swings back in again."<br/><br/>Me: "The dragon fills the room with fire." [Rolled failed]<br/>Player: "I fall down on my knees and pray, and the fire splits in front of me."<br/><br/>The huge gain from playing like this was that the interaction between player-game master became more fluent, even during combat, where each action normally are chopped up and doesn't related to each other. When we played, it all felt like one continuous flow.<br/><br/>And Matin\xe9 were all about the characters being heroes. They never failed because they were bad. Instead, unexpected circumstances came up that made them fail, and new situations were often created from this. The thief didn't fail to lock pick, but guards arrived instead. A new situation to overcome.<br/><br/><b>Mouse Guard</b> got the same thing with complications(?). Failed rolls that leads into something else.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467474/#Comment_467474" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-04T22:33:27+00:00" title="November  4, 2017 10:33PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice technique!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
