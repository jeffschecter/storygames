It's excellent! <br/><br/>For example: <br/><br/>Starting on page 16, it has a whole section on Social Contract. They discuss in detail topics like Respect, Distractions, Food, Character Names, Missing Players, Table Talk, In Character vs. Out of Character Talk, Rules Discussion, Who DMs, Meta Game Knowledge, Dice Rolling Conventions, DM Fudging... and how to customize all this to your specific group.<br/><br/>It's very well written. Even if D&amp;D 4E and tactical RPGs aren't your thing, it may be worth looking at the new DMK for inspiration if you GM, design games, or write rules.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
