Thus PoliCon was born.  PoliCon is a "salon" con I do every year, often trying new formats and such.  This year is a private affair with less people at my own home.  Right now I expect between 12 and 20 people in any given slot and I'd love to have just a few extra games available if we need.  It run 9am to 11pm Saturday and Sunday (3/31 and 4/1).<br/><br/>So I have a pretty cool line up but I find myself running in nearly every slot due to having more participants than GMs.  Anyone that's gonna be in or around Philly this weekend is welcome to let me know and I can send you info.  There is free food and cake involved on Saturday <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>You can find the game list for the convention here: <a href="http://www.realityvault.net/PoliCon/PoliCon_Game_List.htm" rel="nofollow">PoliCon 2007</a><br/><br/>Several of the games are SGs but I have front loaded some of the characters and plots due to time restraints.  I didn't want to rush the game's end so I set up situations, characters and settings.  I am proud to say that I have several folks running "our" games for the first time (namely the two Mountain Witch games).  We're really excited to see how it all pans out.  <br/><br/>As usual your input, praise and criticism is always appreciated.  Let me know if any of you have time for a slot or two to GM/Guide <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I will let you all know how it pans out,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62540/#Comment_62540" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T04:59:39+00:00" title="March 30, 2007  4:59AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, no takers <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>The Miller's upped their GMing and Mike's going to run another playtest of <i>By The Stars</i>.  I played last week and it was spot on for a playtest.  There is some cool dynamics going on.<br/><br/>No doubt some of my friends are rolling their eyes over the "Indie Fest."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62541/#Comment_62541" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T05:21:40+00:00" title="March 30, 2007  5:21AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can run Dogs on Saturday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
