I know some of you from the Forge (sn: Charlie Gilb) or from the Burning Wheel forums (sn: Charlie)<br/>\n<br/>\nDown to business:<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout my history of GMing, the past few years have been full of problems in having a consistently scheduled game. Oftentimes, my players will get really excited about a game, play it for 2 or 3 sessions, and then attendance will start to waiver. I wanted to ask your advice on how you structure your games to accomodate schedules that don't always mesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit more background:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all independent adults, and generally the things that crop up to interfere with our games are usually unexpected family, school, or work obligations. We all agree that these kinds of issues should take priority over our game, and that some level of scheduling conflicts will always occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 4 of us, and our current game of choice is Burning Wheel. If our current campaign doesn't end up working out, then it is likely that we will start a new BW game. All of us want a longer-running 'campaign' rather than a game that will only last a few sessions. We try to schedule our games every week, but schedule conflicts usually mean sessions get adjusted or postponed from every few weeks to once a month, and even that can be a challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have mostly had an issue because we will only play our games when all 4 of us can make it. This has caused me some frustration, because I find it difficult to maintain 'momentum' in a game that people are only really thinking about maybe 2 hours a month. My players seem to agree with me, for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few initial questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you all do to deal with scheduling a long-running game around conflicting schedules? <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have advice specifically in the areas of game premise, session/scene framing &amp; pacing, or anything else? <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you try to make every session a 'self-contained' episode, or are there other techniques I might be overlooking?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you feel about characters being 'ghosted' (i.e., being functionally in the scenes, even when players aren't there)? What are the merits and flaws?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other thoughts or advice would be very appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190219/#Comment_190219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T10:32:01+00:00" title="January 27, 2009 10:32AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Charlie, and welcome.  <br/><br/>I'm in two groups.  One is small enough that a missing person effectively derails our plans - when someone can't make it for whatever reason, we confer and do something else.  Sometimes that's board games, sometimes it's dinner and a movie, sometimes it is a one-shot or a playtest.  Occasionally we'll just skip a week.<br/><br/>My other group is larger and more long-term oriented.  There are seven of us, so one person missing is actually the norm.  We'll fade the missing guy's character from the action typically.  This only poses a problem when they are pivotal for some reason - we had this problem in a PTA game where the spotlight protagonist's player couldn't make it.  In that case we shuffled things around and continued, and it was fine, but at other time's we've played board games or a one-shot.  If we have two absentees we usually pack it in for the week or do something social but not game-related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190220/#Comment_190220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T10:33:16+00:00" title="January 27, 2009 10:33AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen it handled in a bunch of ways.<br/><br/>I am running (well, facilitating; it's GMless) a short series of evenings of Annalise. Four of us are sorta core to the game, not because our characters are core, but because the other two players kinda turtle (we love them anyway). If one of those core players cancels, we can probably soldier on, but we hate for them to miss the fun. If two cancel, we definitely postpone. We try to game weekly, but end up gaming every 2-4 weeks because we have busy schedules. Also, because one player can't make the game tomorrow night, I'm playtesting Verge with them instead.<br/><br/>You can just soldier on. Make up reasons the character disappears. My brother was saying that his group jokes about stuffing the dwarf into a backpack. In other words, the fiction is not all that important. Just handwave it.<br/><br/>Another way I've seen people deal with scheduling conflicts is a combination of episodal play and a large play group. Basically, you cast a wide net to 10-12 people, hope you get at least 4-5 players (and turn away people if you can't handle them all), and make sure each game session is relatively self-contained. That means that next time, when a completely different group of 4-5 players shows up, you're not caught [i]in media res[/i]. The last episode finished up satisfactorily and this week is a new one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190221/#Comment_190221" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T10:38:34+00:00" title="January 27, 2009 10:38AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried having a really big group and play drop games so that we always had "enough", but that didn't work - ultimately it meant that one or two people would show, tops.  <br/><br/>So now I try to find 4 people that will commit to a game, and I set the expectation that the game will be cancelled if there's any cancellations by the players.  So far so good.

One group always plays on Mondays from 7 to 11. Another group always plays on Thursdays from 7 to 11.<br/><br/>After that, it's really on the players to be courteous to each other and not schedule against those periods. They're blocked off in the calendar.<br/><br/>Now, of course, certain unexpected obligations come up. That's life. There are legitimate reasons for not being able to make a session and we all understand that, and it's not a big deal if you have to cancel. <br/><br/>However, we expect everyone to behave like adults: 1. If you know ahead of time that you can't make it, you let everybody know as soon as possible, 2. You never cancel at the last minute unless it's completely unavoidable, and 3. You don't passive aggressively use a lack of attendance to show your displeasure with a game or as a way of leaving the game; you either work with everyone to address your issue or you excuse yourself for the run of that game. <br/><br/>The Thursday group has an issue in that one of the regular players is a first year lawyer and sometimes has to work late into the night on little to zero notice. And one of the other players is in film school and sometimes has shoots that are inconveniently scheduled or run over their scheduled time. For that group, we have an expectation that we will play as long as there are three players and a GM. The characters of any players that aren't present just don't show up in our session. We just don't have our characters notice it. It's a D&amp;D game, so it doesn't seem like such a big deal.<br/><br/>The Monday Burning Wheel game will generally go on if one player can't make it, but will almost certainly be canceled if two players can't make it. We'll tend to focus on subplots for a session when someone is missing, using it as an opportunity to explore character issues and relationships. These sessions tend to feel like character-centric midseason episodes of certain SF television shows, when they're trying to save their budgets by reducing the number of actors they have to pay and skimping on special effects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190228/#Comment_190228" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T11:06:45+00:00" title="January 27, 2009 11:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the replies!<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Jason: Do you define "party play" as what you would normally see with, say, a typical DnD group, where all of the PCs tend to be together all the time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Grant">@Grant</a>: Any particular reason fading is better than ghosting?

I killed a PC while his player wasn't there. Never again.<br/><br/>I was running 2nd edition MechWarrior set in the year 3000; no Clans. etc. I lifted some stuff from Pendragon in the hopes of running a 'dynastic' game, where each session would represent a year of game time. Each player ran an entire family and estate, with diplomacy through betrothal and such. If a character died, the player could apply their Adventure Points to the next character.<br/><br/>All of this blew away in the cold reality on the ground. Each session picked up where the last one left off, the group gathered together and bonded immediately, and no, the player was not at all pleased about having to make a new character, though he is the greatest guy and was very gracious about it.<br/><br/>It's certainly a player-control issue, as it should be. Fading means the character isn't there, and for me it means you don't spend another moment dwelling upon it. If it's a role-critical game like D&amp;D4 or Shadowrun, perhaps you can have a fill-in NPC who also fades away at the end of the session. <br/><br/>If it's a roleplay-intensive game, where character interaction is the focus, then you can't properly ghost them anyway. But consider TV dramas where actors can skip whole episodes without impacting the plot. Name one character in Grey's Anatomy that is essential to everything going on (and the actors, to their chagrin, can't seem to learn that lesson).<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190241/#Comment_190241" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T11:36:14+00:00" title="January 27, 2009 11:36AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie G</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Thor-">@Thor-</a> How many players are in your two groups?

However, this often requires a big shift in player expectations, and for some folks, party play is why they roleplay, so this option may not work for you.<br/><br/>Going biweekly seems to work for some other groups, but in my experience anything less frequent than weekly tends to fall apart.<br/><br/>You might also investigate a different day or time.  It might be as simple as that.<br/><br/>Short games are another option, although you've said that your players want long.  Have you considered doing a series of short games featuring the same characters?  Formally recognize that the next three weeks is "The Mystery of the Forbidden Temple" and that that will be one complete story, a complete cycle of play.  Players need to show up to all three, but then when the next story starts up, they can take a story off.<br/><br/>Lastly, take a peek at <em>In a Wicked Age</em>.  The "Anthology Engine" that it runs off of produces (typically) one-session stories that are still intertwined together in a satisfactory sort of way.  You might try playing IAWA straight up, or just stealing the good bits for your BW game, and attempting to "anthologize" Burning Wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190322/#Comment_190322" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T16:28:20+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  4:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my D&amp;D and D&amp;D-like games, we always just played on with whoever was present so long as we had enough players (enough players sometimes defined as two players). Sometimes we NPCed the characters of missing players. Sometimes they weren't present. Sometimes it varied session to session (sometimes the missing player would let us know if he wanted us to NPC or absent the character). The games were generally relatively low death rate so the risk of having your PC die while run as an NPC was low (to nonexistent - sometimes with a fudge). We never gave much thought to the in fiction rationale. In one Fantasy Hero campaign, the players cried (or I would announce): "damn that wizard gets around" to signal a reality shift as a PC faded in or out. In a game with mostly wilderness encounters, the missing player's PCs would have been off in the bushes taking care of business when an encounter happened.<br/><br/>Thor gives some good suggestions for Burning Wheel. Another idea if you know you will have spotty attendance is to set up each PC with an ability to scout or do research on their own. If the player doesn't show, the character is sent off on a scouting or research mission. The next session when the player is present, you can resolve the scouting or research with a test or two or three. The fact that there could be combat resolved by a bloody versus (or just plain versus) test may be sufficient incentive for the players to show up as often as possible.<br/><br/>Josh's note that the "party play" that is troublesome is when it is hard and fast. Loosen the expectation up just a bit, and it becomes less troublesome (and really, the PCs fading in and out is just one way to loosen up expectations).<br/><br/>The real key is you need to make sure sessions don't end in a cliffhanger that requires everyone to show up the following week to resolve.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190463/#Comment_190463" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T15:03:54+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  3:03PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>If your play group can't consistently make total attendance to a weekly game, then... don't schedule a weekly game that requires total attendance.</blockquote>\nThis is pretty much it. I think just <i>discussing</i> it with people will work out a lot of issues.  Don't just leave it with "everyone is going to be here all the time, RIGHT?!" because everyone will say yes and will still give gaming whatever priority they had already given it.  What you need to do is say "I know everyone is going to try to be here all the time, but let's just be clear on what will happen if one or two of us can't make it."<br/><br/>My group loves party play, in fact I'd say the primary reason for them to play is for them to play their characters riffing off each other (riffing off my (as GM) situation is a close second).  So if half the group isn't there, there's not much point playing - not for story reasons, but just because they're not going to get what they want out of it.  Hell, the story might march onwards without a hiccup, but that's not what they're after, or not the only thing they're after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190534/#Comment_190534" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T09:47:52+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  9:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the ongoing long term campaign of In Nomine I'm presently GMing, I can deal with one or two cancellations.

What I've decided upon is to run things in an episodic fashion. Conceptually, it has let me organize my adventure ideas into blocks, leaving individual side-plots to run "whenever". The final 2 sessions (it will run for 7 sessions) will, however, be a single arc. I've let people know that they should try to commit to both or miss both. We'll see how that works, because I really want to run a big finale with a cliffhanger on the second-last session.<br/><br/>As for players taking responsibility, from experience I know that the best I can hope for with this group is that if someone doesn't show by an hour after we start, they probably won't show. As bad as this sounds, this is the most reliable rpg group I've found in the past couple of years, and the only one that managed more than a single session. I find that, amongst other things, teaching players to take responsibility for their involvement in a game is a very long-term process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192074/#Comment_192074" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T07:28:42+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  7:28AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a floating and gradually changing group of players over the years, with only Steve left of the original group. The important thing for me is to have a sufficiently large pool of players that it's very rare that only two will tutn up due to last minute cancellations. We've got a forum to keep an eye on this, and we never hold it against people if they can't or don't want to turn up. Any three people together and we can roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe work around absent PCs fairly easily. Very occasionally we have to cancel a game and run another one where the presence of one player is essential. Then, we can resume it, or not. We have a keen sense of when a game has outstayed its welcome, and at the end of each session we decide if we want to run it the following week. We are unusual in that we have three GMs eager to run stuff. In a group with just one GM, it's much easier to take it personally if the players want to do something else. Occasionally, Graham will run a game, and we will participate out of politeness to avoid a sulk or hissy fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe magic number of players is six, I think, and if numbers fall below that we start looking. At the moment, a new player turned up for a week and may or may not return. If he doesn't, there'll be no hard feelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192081/#Comment_192081" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T08:30:32+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  8:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've adopted a version of Bush's policy on torture.

When I can't make it, I make sure someone else in the group runs a one-shot to keep the group together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192442/#Comment_192442" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T08:28:02+00:00" title="February 13, 2009  8:28AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've battled with similar issues (as we all have apparently): With my current BW game, we've specifically set up the game to be episodic in nature, with the goal of finishing an episode each session. I have different story lines developing for each character, along with a couple of larger, group story lines. BW is particularly good at this since you can target certain beliefs during certain spotlight episodes and focus on the larger story development when everyone is present. Thus we just mix and match the themes and issues of a particular episode to fit the characters present. It requires a bit of improv but it's worked well so far (2 sessions in so knock on wood at this point).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
