The concept is a set of rules that constantly sees updating, available to the public (or signed up members of a forum). These rules gradually evolve and improve based on feedback from those who are a part of a community of regular users, the rules never get "formalised" in a static printed version, they remain electronic, dynamic and fluid.<br/><br/>I'm toying with an idea that fuses these two concepts. A living ashcan.<br/><br/>Participants buy into the project, and if they buy in early it doesn't have much cost. Once they have bought into the project they continue to get updates for the life of the game (such updates might be weekly, monthly, quarterly)...as the game gets more refined, it costs a little more for new participants to access the rulebook, but they are buying into a more refined product (so there is less risk for them, and they can see more of what they're buying into).<br/><br/>The living rulebook will keep evolving and advancing until specific points in the project's timeline or funding. Once these points are reached, a specific hardcopy is released and everyone who is a part of the project gets subsidies for their dedication and input.<br/><br/>I've started this concept with a game called Voidstone Chronicles...it went live on DrivethruRPG/RPGNow yesterday. If you're interested, <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/127610/Voidstone-Chronicles--Living-Ashcan" rel="nofollow">go over and take a look</a>.

Which makes a lot of sense; game rules can be seen as "code" that incrementally develops.  What remains to be seen is whether that model can successfully be applied to an industry for which the market already had another model.<br/><br/>Another radical idea that began with software developers is the "opensource" model, which began with things like <a href="http://apache.org/" rel="nofollow">webservers</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org" rel="nofollow">content management systems</a> but since has been applied to everything from <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/" rel="nofollow">industrial machine plans</a> to <a href="http://www.coultersmithing.com/forums/index.php" rel="nofollow">technical engineering solutions</a>.  An opensource project is like a big public "library" that not only allows people to check things out, but also put things <i>in.</i>  A typical opensource project has many contributors but is owned by no one, it develops emergently based on community feedback and is in a constant state of flux, it is comprised of hundreds or thousands of small functional contributions or edits made by different people who will probably never meet each other, and may possess an infinite number of divergent "branches" or specific applications which assemble the available parts in different ways.  Unlike most other innovations from the software industry, one thing opensource projects are <i>not</i> designed to do is generate profit for the people who create them.  Opensource projects are free in both senses of the word.  They may be seen as the application of socialist or anarchist philosophy to problems of technological innovation and knowledge distribution.<br/><br/>I'm currently involved in (what may be the first?) opensource RPG design project, right here on this forum [<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development" rel="nofollow">DayTrippers</a>].  I hope to spread more awareness not only of this project, but of the opensource development model in general, to RPG designers.  Opensource is The Future(TM).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430236/#Comment_430236" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T14:28:35+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  2:28PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2014 2:31PM by Rafu.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>, aren't you conflating "open source" with "crowdsourced"? I mean, the idea of releasing RPG texts as <a href="http://freedomdefined.org" rel="nofollow">free cultural works</a> is pretty widespread by now: just check out the <a href="http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">FOSsil Bank</a>. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitodirafu/Home/i-miei-giochi" rel="nofollow">My own works are available as such</a> (only one "finished" English language game for now, I'm sorry), and indeed one of the many advantages is being able to keep refining and perfecting both design and text over a long time without ever feeling "at a fault" toward end-users who might have given me money at a given moment (possibly receiving a copy of the "most current state" of the text as a token of gratitude).<br/>But\u2026 the idea of licensing off game texts in independently published and creator-owned RPGs is at least as old as Clinton R. Nixon (one of the founding fathers of the Forge and, to my knowledge, a free software user/advocate) releasing <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> under permissive terms (might be full-on Public Domain, I would need to check) \u2014 which did in fact spark a significant "new edition" in the form of <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen%27s">@Eero_Tuovinen's</a> <i>Solar System</i> (which I think is licensed CC BY-SA or something close) and <i>The World of Near</i>.<br/>All of the above would qualify as "open source" projects in software code terms, even if the number of people involved in creating each is small (often as small as a single author-designer). Another significant implementation of the open source concept in role-playing games, explicitly taken from software coding, was with the d20 System: whatever one's overall opinion of it, one <i>could</i> conceivably think of the whole of D&amp;D3 + compatible third party books as a single huge crowd-sourced effort. It also spawned new ideas or significantly affected more efforts, such as introducing the concept of a System Reference Document (SRD, now employed by such game engines as <i>FATE</i> or <i>Gumshoe</i> to initiate crowd-sourced projects affiliated with those brands) or producing the D&amp;D retro-clones which, arguably, became a foundation for the OSR movement (though, ironically, you wouldn't actually need any license at all from the copyright holders of D&amp;D <i>texts</i> to lawfully clone the game mechanics of D&amp;D to any extent).<br/><br/>Gosh, this became a long rambling post\u2026<br/><br/>I was just trying to say: <i>DayTrippers</i> might well be the first purposeful crowd-sourced RPG design effort, for all I know, but I don't believe it accurate to call it the first "open source" one. And by saying this I don't mean to diminish the value of your work, not at all: rather, I think you should rejoice in the knowledge that you're not alone in your endeavors, at all, but indeed in quite the merry company.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430239/#Comment_430239" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T16:28:40+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  4:28PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> - Please note my question mark.  I'm not unfamiliar with the publishing methodologies you mention, and I don't feel this thread is the best place to get too far into semantic arguments, but what you are proposing effectively removes any difference between "crowdsource" and "opensource", which would render one of those two words useless.  I do not believe this is the case.  A crowdsourced project is typically not applied in as modular a fashion as it was assembled, for one thing, and the opensource understanding of the word "free" is not merely economic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430258/#Comment_430258" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-30T02:58:06+00:00" title="March 30, 2014  2:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really ought to do something about my forum posting habits\u2026 Like, I should quit posting to any forums, period. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> That's cause, apparently I'm often coming up as an asshole without meaning it.<br/><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>, my whole, rambling post was meant as a reply to your question mark (or, rather, the question I read to be implied in your question mark: "is this the first experiment?").
