(And really, why do you think that liking narrative control is a sign of courage, and that your friend is "afraid" because he doesn't like the same thing you do?  What's that about?)<br/><br/>Second, why "convert" him?  Have you knelt before the altar and swore a holy oath to forsake all games that do not include this mechanic, and shun the nonbelievers?  That seems weird.  If there's some game you love that's no fun for you unless he  exercises whatever narrative control it gives him, then maybe you should just resolve to not play that game with him.  Play something else with him, and save the troublesome game to play with other people.<br/><br/>Really, all you can do is try playing it.  If he likes it, he likes it.  If he doesn't, he doesn't.  This is not a matter of conversion or the One True Way or anything like that, it's just a mechanic.  It doesn't appeal to everyone, and it probably shouldn't.<br/><br/><br/>Still, here's one thing that I have noticed which makes it much easier to pitch a "weird" game to an entrenched RPG veteran:  don't try and sell the mechanics.  Don't tell him it's a revolution in game design or the greatest thing since sliced bread or that it makes D&amp;D look like a busted Monopoly board with half the pieces missing, because that kind of hype is poisonous and counterproductive.  Don't try and get him enthusiastic about the system.<br/><br/>Instead, pitch the game you're going to play:  sell the setting, sell the characters, sell the idea that this is going to be you sitting down with your friends and having fun together.  If there's something in particular that would appeal to him ("it's just like Aliens," "it has a really cool and easy to use way to make new magic spells," or whatever), mention it.  That's where you want to generate the enthusiasm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227429/#Comment_227429" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T23:20:52+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 11:20PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, what do you mean by "Narrative Control"?<br/><br/>I prefer games like My Life with Master, Sorcerer, Dogs in the Vineyard, Don't Rest Your Head... and several others where "Narrative Control" is not something fixed.

Is he not taking control of the narrative simply out of habit, or because he doesn't enjoy that kind of game, or maybe because he doesn't fully understand how much power he is allowed to have? Maybe you should just have a quiet word with him on one side, away from the rest of the group but without arousing suspicion, and explain to him that nothing he can possibly try and do will ruin your plot.<br/><br/>I've had a few players like this, and I usually find the problem is either that they lack confidence in their ability to weave a cogent storyline (or have a poor imagination), or that they are worried they're going to mess up someone elses' plans, usually the GM's. In the former case there's not much you can do about it beyond encourage them to take part. In the latter, you just have to get them out of the idea that you've got a specific story already planned out.<br/><br/>Or just keep playing and rely on the other players to lead by example. You never know, if he sees everyone else doing crazy stuff and fiddling with the 'official' story, he might get the idea, see how fun it is, and join in.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227545/#Comment_227545" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T09:30:07+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  9:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 9:30AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group just doesn't like it.
