I'm limiting the game to 4 players and myself and hope to get an area where I can fold up the tables and run on the floor "caveman" style.<br/><br/>I do worry a bit about players getting frustrated with all the grunting after awhile.  My searches for AP reports have turned up very little,  so any feedback/suggestions/experiences would be very helpful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59072/#Comment_59072" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T13:17:02+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  1:17PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I layed it as a one shot at Gencon. It rocks. Hard. The grunting is actually tons of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would go to great, great lengths to explain to people that you cannot TALK during the game. You can't step out of character and explain what your character is trying to say. Yes, I know it seems obvious, but in the game I played there was one player who just did not get this and kept trying to explain to everyone what her character was trying to say! So really, if you think there is any confusion at all, go out of your way to explain how the game is supposed to work. Nothing ruins it faster then one of the players saying "my character is trying to tell you that you need to follow her".<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a copy of Primitive at Gencon, but lost both it and 1001 Nights on the way home. I just finally got around to reordering both from the new local store that opened just blocks from my house (next to the really good new sushi place)!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59083/#Comment_59083" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T13:51:49+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  1:51PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting.

When we played at Gencon we could certainly describe what we were doing in general. Like "I'm climbing this ridge" or "I'm attacking this thing". But you couldnt have tyour character say "I'm attacking this thing" he'd have to say "abugah bugah bugah" and everyone would have to figure that out. I'm sure i'm remembering it all wrong, and I don't have the book in front of me unfortunatly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember waving my arms around a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59127/#Comment_59127" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T16:42:42+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  4:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris, thanks for picking up the game and extra special thanks for the length you went to get and play it. To answer the question first put out there...<br><br>Yeah you can describe to the GM what you are doing. "I'm going to go hide behind the tree" if your telling your GM, totally fair. If you're telling the tribe, point at the tree, cover your eyes, grunt like a great ape, whatever you gotta do but then you cant talk.<br><br>What Jake says above is totally legit. Really emphasize that the no talking thing is important, I've found the best way to really drive this point home to the players is to explain to them that it's really a lot of fun. I like to have a simple problem solving scene to start so people can get comfortable with each other and the language thing.<br><br>If you have any other questions please feel free to ask them here, i'll be glad to answer. But i would also love to hear other people's input as to how they play the game as well. I'm really no more an authority than anyone else who has played the game and read the book. Everyone's conclusions are worth a lot here.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59202/#Comment_59202" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T08:02:50+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  8:02AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I think the best advice is what Chris is already doing (having seen his draft write-up): he's very clearly noted the non-traditional PC-to-PC communication style of the game.<br><br>While I respect folks' comments re: "tell them it's really a lot of fun", I think the best time to let players know about this constraint is up front when they are considering the game, and not after they've committed to the game.<br><br>Not everyone is going to enjoy the no talking thing.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
