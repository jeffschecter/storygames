They could be used for a lot of games - any game where you're supposed to come up with a goal or two for your character before play...<br/><br/>I've got about 18 vague motivations which you roll a die to get more specific with, for example:<br/><br/><b>You want a closer relationship with them, but ...</b><br/>1) They're too busy.<br/>2) They don't feel that way about you.<br/>3) They're  not ready for children.<br/>4) There's too much bad history there.<br/>5) They don't know you exist.<br/>6) They're involved with someone else.<br/><b>Do you get it?</b><br/><br/>But I want more!<br/><br/>So ... same question as my other That's Drama thread. Should I put out the list I've got so far, so you can say "I can't believe you forgot X", or should I let you all go at it, unpoisoned?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
