Undying has a set of rules that (hopefully) focus play better, so the way people play should be more in line with the principles of Vampire. That said, it still comes down to how people play \u2013 Undying could be supers with fangs too.

Note that the 5-7 and 8+ architecture only applies to moves where you roll +Humanity vs. people (which includes your connection).<br/><br/>I started the game design with the Humanity/Will sum to zero stat concept. I wanted Resisting Temptation, the most important Humanity-driven move, to have no better than a +1 stat to for it \u2013 so you can\u2019t be too good at resisting the Downward Spiral. On the other side of the coin, Will drives your vampire moves, so going to +3 is the limit (mathematically, going higher on 2d6 pushes you into auto-succeed territory).<br/><br/>The problem that sum to zero causes, is that your character is likely to fail more often than not if I make you roll straight +Humanity for dealing with people when you have a non-negative Will score. From pretty much all vampire myth, you should be able to succeed against most people, at most things, most of the time. My solution is to effectively add +2 to all your dice rolls on moves against people. Now, when you have a +1 Humanity, it\u2019s like rolling +3 against them and, even if you have +3 Will, you\u2019re only effectively rolling -1 against them. <br/><br/>Right, so why not just have Humanity and Will add up to +2  so that Humanity mechanically works right with people in the first place? I probably should have. Why I didn\u2019t: first, because Resist Temptation works with the normal move architecture and is biased against resisting \u2013 the way it should be for an emo vampire game; second, Observe is biased against understanding people \u2013 that sounded good to me; and third, the Devil\u2019s move Monster makes them roll all +Humanity moves on the normal 7-9 and 10+ scale, which biases them toward violence as the solution for Prey-related problems \u2013 which (I think) gives the playbook a really cool synergy. Also, aesthetically, it says that people are a lesser challenge than vampires, so you succeed on a lower result.<br/><br/>I like the approach in theory; but, having written this, I\u2019m going to reconsider that design choice. Particularly, if it trips people up in practice. So, to those of you giving this a shot, please let me know how it went.<br/><br/>Thanks for asking!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391111/#Comment_391111" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T14:00:05+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  2:00PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the answer, actually. Perhaps a conceit could push towards "on rolls vs prey, 5-8, 8+; on all other rolls, 7-9, 10+. Mortals are simple to a creature like you", or more simply, "take 2 forward on all rolls when dealing with Prey". Hah, an interesting side effect of that would make it harder to Hunt animals than people, making the Vampire Vegan diet harder. Assuming you consider that even possible for this game. Anyway, I'll likely be testing this out with a friend over the next few days, and I'll let you know what we think. It looks great and thematic, its just less elegant, and I'll take theme over elegance any day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391113/#Comment_391113" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T14:27:56+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  2:27PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome! Thanks for giving Undying a try. Playbook layout is coming - hopefully next week.<br/><br/>Agree it's less elegant. I think some vs. Prey moves need to be hard and Resist Temptation definitely needs to be hard. I'll keep looking for a better compromise.<br/><br/>As to whether or not Vampires can feed on animals, that falls under Vampire Lore - check that section out. Basically, whether they can or can't is totally up to you! I've only made hard and fast rules out of the things I think are must-follow. I think there's enough vampire lore out there these days that to enforce WoD dogma in an indie hack is detrimental. If that's the way you want to play, cool- play it that way! If you want Buffy, True Blood, or your own way, you should be able to play it that way too.

I love the <i>Blood and Feeding</i> rules! I'm eager to see if I can find some folks to give this a try (all my RPG friends have moved away, sadly)...<br/><br/>I have a writing style question for you. You...um...drop the old f-bomb plenty. I'm no prude, but stylistically suggests a couple things to me. Firstly, I sense modern feel for the setting (and I am definitely one to associate a rule-set's writing style to the setting). Was that part of your intention? Secondly, I'm curious why you chose this language? Mark Twain called the difference between the wrong words and the right words the difference between a "lightning bug" and a "lightning bolt." Did you consider other words? I would love to dive into your writer's head and see where the vulgarities emerged!<br/><br/>~K.G.<br/><br/>P.S. I'm totally cool with using foul language, but I'm always curious to hear a writer's justification, especially when used to communicate rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391117/#Comment_391117" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T16:48:52+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  4:48PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2012 4:52PM by Paul_Riddle.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair question. In contrast is the other gaming project I\u2019m working on, the Regiment, which is quite the opposite. Let me say that the intent of the language is not to offend, though some of the language is probably offensive. That\u2019s not what you said or asked; but, since we\u2019re on the topic\u2026<br/><br/>I think the language sets the tone I want for the game, which is dark, personal, and gritty. So I wrote it largely in the second person (I wasn\u2019t super-consistent) with a lot of fragments, run-ons, and foul language. It\u2019s modern, for sure; but, this is supposed to be a VtM hack, not dark ages or Victorian, nor is it my intent to make a setting-neutral game. Incidentally, I\u2019m going to run a Victorian era Parisian game next week. We\u2019ll see how that goes.<br/><br/>Back on topic - I thought that talking to the reader this way would convey the game\u2019s message of struggle and personal horror clearly, in a way that proper, clinical English might lack. Even if the technical aspects of the rules are defined precisely, if they don\u2019t have the right emotional punch, particularly in the context of Vampire, they miss the mark. The language choice is intended to hit that mark. <br/><br/>I may be wrong; but, that\u2019s the choice I made. I think the world is too uptight and serious these days and could use some R-rated, 80\u2019s-style action movie throwback, so yippee ki-yay motherfuckers!
