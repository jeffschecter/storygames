Is the trust score of a relationship only a game pacing gauge telling us when to play a fallout or breakdown action? Do the players have to come out with something that explain why the relationship "naturally" breakout in the fiction? <br/><br/>Or do the damage received by the relationships composing the ANIMa actually do something to the characters feelings? Like if your character loose his ANIMa shield who was his brother relationship, when he come out of the ANIMa rig, do he now feel strangely cold, distant or irritable toward his brother? Do it mess with the character emotions, feeling and psyche? Or maybe do it mess with reality? Like you come out of the rig, you are glad to see your brother but he ignore you or don't want to talk to you anymore and you don't know why.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258551/#Comment_258551" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T14:57:15+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  2:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very much a "how do you like to play it" question. It can work both ways (yes, there's a direct impact 1:1 from ANIMa damage to emotional turmoil; no, it's a correlative, not causative thing). Sometimes in the same game.<br/><br/>One thing generally NOT to do is let the numbers dictate how you play the relationship. They do point you at what kinds of scenes you as a player may want to pursue, and limit your options, but they don't dictate the characters' feelings and priorities.<br/><br/>My most recent game had the technobabble as the damage in-dream inflicting trauma on the limbic system - making characters erratic, emotionally labile, and impaired in memory and bonding. But lots of ways to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258560/#Comment_258560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T15:38:54+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  3:38PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of making it an in-setting thing just because that's so freaky. Here we are, using technology we hardly understand, and for some reason everybody's so <i>tense</i> and <i>resentful</i> all the time... then somebody might at some point put two and two together and realize that ANIMa does, in fact, run on human relationships. Weird metagame territory ahoy, as the characters start to strategize about their relationships <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Mark's point about the meaning of numbers is important - for the most part those numbers do not dictate the nature of relationships, only whether they exist and what you need to do to change the numbers. So what you do in the fiction gets reflected in the numbers, but not the other way around. There might be an exception for when a relationship gets broken; at least I've found it difficult to completely ignore that, so in practice it becomes something like, your character wakes up the day after the mission, goes out to meet the love of his life and then realizes that hey, actually I don't care about her anymore, oh how fickle is the heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258597/#Comment_258597" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T20:50:06+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  8:50PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Often times, we have scenes after missions that show just exactly how the relationship got fucked up due to the mission, but -- you're totally right -- it's not always entirely clear until we make it clear.  In my mind, it has something to do with the pilots projecting the stress of the mission on their relationships, but you could do it some crazy mindfuck psychic way too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258600/#Comment_258600" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T21:07:40+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  9:07PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 9:34PM by Cedric P.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep I noted that the numbers should not dictate the nature of the relationship. This is why I was thinking about trust as a pacing mechanic. <br/>Well, crazy mindfuck psychic or not, this is all very interesting. I agree that if the pilots catch how the ANIMa can influence relationships... love triangle could become quite interesting... One anchor or pilot could try to figure out what part of his best friend ANIMa represent their common love interest, try to make a accident happen, etc...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
