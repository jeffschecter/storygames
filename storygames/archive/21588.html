However, reflecting on things recently, I've realized that all my most contentious GM interactions have been with GMs who didn't obey AW's dictum to "Be a fan of the PCs." I'm actually willing to be slightly forgiving of a *little bit* of heavy-handed bullshit with rules or rulings, as long as I feel like the GM actually knows who my character is and respects who they are.<br/><br/>I mean, in many ways this isn't some deep insight: if you bother to build good relationships with the people around you, you have more room to make mistakes. But in the case of an RPG, I think the key about the way Vincent concisely articulated this principle is that it's not just about the real people, but also about each player's avatar in the game. Know who they are and what they care about, and you're also respecting the player's choices.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471936/#Comment_471936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-14T16:04:43+00:00" title="April 14, 2018  4:04PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2018 4:11PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed.<br/><br/>I don't think I'd enjoy GMing at all if I were <i>not</i> a fan of the player characters, and this holds for <i>every</i> GM style, including "impartial ref" and "guy who's totally running the show".<br/><br/>If there's one opportunity I always try to afford players when I GM, it's to play their characters in such a way that we can become fans of them.  Play which lacks this feature (e.g. play where the PCs remain unknowns) generally lacks what I like about roleplaying.<br/><br/>FWIW, for me, PC fandom takes different forms in different play styles.  In protagonist-driven story games, it's more like TV show fandom ("What'll they do next?"), while in challenge-based play it's more like sports fandom ("I'm rooting for your victory!").  In railroaded play, I suspect it's more the former, though I haven't really thought about that before.

I wrote a list of what not to do, which I'll put here, but bear in mind that not all of these things happened in this particular game -- it's from a combination of games.<br/><br/>* Don't bring a town with preset secrets and plots. (This is not 100% true of Monsterhearts 2nd edition if you're using the Small Towns, but I note Small Towns present questions, not answers.)<br/>* Don't bring a plot. More precisely, don't bring a plot that you insist on the players sticking with if they don't want to. (This is Monsterhearts-specific, possibly PbtA-specific, but if you're running Call of Cthulhu and you tell me the uncle I didn't know my PC had has summoned me to spend a night in his creepy manor, I'm not going to say, "Nah, I'd rather go to the beach" because I've signed up for a CoC game with a specific plot.)<br/>* Especially with one solution only.<br/>* Don't break my toys! There is a lot of advice in Monsterhearts and in other *World games about how to be a fan of the players and their characters. Breaking their toys, denying them the cool stuff they signed on expecting to have in favor of your cool plot is not being a fan of them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471992/#Comment_471992" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T14:21:59+00:00" title="April 15, 2018  2:21PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, I don't understand it.

If my character concept is a friendly, charming politician who is beloved by everyone, I might be able to stomach a scene I have no control over where I charmingly win over the opposition and then bask in my popularity, even if I have no say in it, because it's still based on my original contribution to the game - the character concept. However, if the GM railroads me into a situation where I piss everyone off with a terrible faux pas and then murder someone... now we're really in "I'm walking out of this game!" territory. Not only am I being railroaded, but it's clear the GM isn't even considering my input (via the character concept) into the game, so I can't even enjoy playing the character I wanted to play.<br/><br/>Similarly, fudging the dice so that my Awesome Warrior gets to kill Orcs instead of dying in a pointless scuffle is somewhat palatable. Fudging the dice so my Awesome Warrior gets captured by a bunch of Orcs he should be able to defeat... again, the player is more likely to be upset or to speak up. Why did she bother making the Awesome Warrior in the first place, if the GM is going to cheat so he loses every fight?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471997/#Comment_471997" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T15:17:29+00:00" title="April 15, 2018  3:17PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa, that sounds like the GM was more a fan of their plot than a fan of the PCs.

Now I see this practice as totally disrespectful towards player even when it may be tolerated and become hilarious to everyone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472044/#Comment_472044" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T15:16:16+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  3:16PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, great point.

The NPC has been established as someone who is scared of physical violence. We play out a scene where you try to intimidate them.<br/><br/>1. The GM has a plot in mind where the NPC acts a certain way or does a certain thing, so they override your attempt (doesn't matter whether it's played freeform or a roll - maybe the GM just says, "Nah, he doesn't care", or maybe he sets an impossibly high difficulty for the roll).<br/><br/>2. The GM sees that the game's rules, procedures or habits should result in the NPC not being intimidated, so they cheat or fudge so that the NPC <i>does</i> get scared.<br/><br/>Heck, in a worse version, the GM just SAYS you look intimidating, even though you said nothing of the sort! Maybe she demands a roll even though you didn't ask for one, and it succeeds.<br/><br/>In all cases, the GM might be cheating and/or railroading - doing something against our agreed-upon sense of how we play this game, whether it's acting in accordance to freeform roleplay, fudging the dice, or taking away your agency in how you play your character - but the first case goes against your character concept and the second supports it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472094/#Comment_472094" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T19:06:36+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  7:06PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, the GM doesn't have to be using Force against my aims. <br/><br/>Using Force to help me win makes me mad, too, because it takes the victory away from me.

What would be an example of FT use to counter someone's character core concept?</div></blockquote>\nOK, so let's take the example of the invisible hag escaping combat a little more easily than she probably should have been able to. Under the circumstances, it wasn't that big an issue, because we only had "ordinary" tools available to us, like looking for her footprints in the dirt and listening for her moving around. But if someone had a class feature or even just a spell that let them see invisible? And the GM had just overridden it? That's when I'd get pretty angry.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Thinking about it more, most of my really bad examples of when a GM failed to be a fan of a character I was playing were <i>not</i> necessarily about "railroading" in the traditional sense. That is, in the cases I'm thinking of, the GM wasn't invested in the story as a whole having a particular outcome. <br/><br/>It's more that he was either (a) trying to block me from doing *a* particular thing at a particular moment (that I really should have been able to do) or (b) wanted to use the system to inflict maximum pain and misery on our PCs, such that even if everything he did was technically "by the book," it was done sort of vindictively.<br/><br/>For an example of (a): Burning Wheel, post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. One of the big mysteries of the campaign was how exactly the apocalypse had happened, several centuries before. I and another player both had written Beliefs about finding the true cause of the Apocalypse. We spent several rolls establishing, successfully, that a particular noble both had the relevant documents and was willing to help us. I then went into the basement to actually look at the documents which, again, had been <i>established to contain the relevant information</i>. I wanted, naturally, to roll my character's rather massive History skill (especially massive given some bonuses from helping skills like Research)... and the GM said no, that it wasn't an appropriate use of that skill, and that I'd need something non-existent and specific like "Apocalypse-wise" to be able to make the roll. It was a mind-bogglingly bad call, I basically bullied him into letting me roll my skill, and the group ended up breaking up over the whole thing.<br/><br/>(BTW, all my supposedly vaunted anti-RR techniques basically amount to, "Be willing to be a bully and make enemies." There's one exception which I'll get into in a separate post.)<br/><br/>Now, there was a whole lot going on here, that I don't have the time / space / energy to get into, both with that specific scene and with the group. But the point is, the root of the failure here was that the GM (a) didn't know or care about my character's Beliefs, which are the most important part of play in BW, (b) wasn't willing to respect where I had put my focus in character-building (i.e., my character's "deal" was that he was an accomplished scholar), and (c) was trying to prevent a particular outcome that made him uncomfortable\u2014namely, the revelation of one of the campaign's big mysteries, as authored by me (not that he had figured it out...).<br/><br/>As for (b), it's a little trickier to explain, but just to give one slightly concise example, also from BW, different campaign: we were having an *extremely* brutal fight, but finally managed to start wounding the monster, getting through its (frankly game-breaking) defenses and draining its dice-pool. The tide of battle had, mathematically, finally shifted in the PCs' favor sufficiently that we pretty much *had* won, but it would have taken a whole lot more real-life time to seal the deal. We ran out of time IRL, and the GM declared that the creature ran away.<br/><br/>This was immensely frustrating, for obvious reasons, but by the same token I *don't* believe he would have negated our impending victory if we hadn't run out of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472137/#Comment_472137" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T04:23:14+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  4:23AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> In b) The GM's reaction/decision confuses me.

I imagine a PC-loving GM that wants to curate the drama curve by selective obedience to dice including occasional violation of gloracle.<br/><br/>Hence Adam's and my confusion here, because you haven't been saying why railroading for the sake of the PCs was <i>good</i>; you've made it clear that you've identified a subset of the opposition that you feel is worse but not why we should absolve the rest.<br/><br/>Again, to railroaders: I've buried the hatchet. Once I found (and helped create) a steady stream of GMs who <i>don't</i> railroad I stopped being so panicked over the ones that do.

The gm is providing the opposition for these characters, it's his job to make life difficult for them.  You cant be so much a fan that you cant bear to see them get the tiniest scratch or so happy to see them succeed that you hand out mounds of loot for the most minor success.  There's a balancing act and it's tricky.  <br/><br/>Lots of good advice here about being true to the character concept but even that is a little tricky when different people can have a different idea of the concept.  I remember a Gurps character who was a bit of a con-man adventurer who ran from the police on occasion where I felt the gm went overboard on tracking him down, including using lots of magic.

Maturity because trying to feed your ego by imposing your will over others is a proof of insecurity. Use a rulebook or subtle force techniques, justify it behind rule zero, "because the story demands it" or "because the game is meant to me challenging" etc. you are still being childish. I've got that clear now.<br/><br/>Experience because most of this sort of railroading happens when the GM becomes afraid. Afraid that players will end the campaign too soon. Afraid of seeing all your efforts go to waste. Afraid the mood is switching to something you don't want. Afraid something you didn't expect will send the plot out of control and more important, outside the bounds of your prep. Experience can save you then. There are many ways to avoid falling into the fear and it's best as a GM to learn them.<br/><br/>The worse ways you can learn -and sadly, the first you learn about- pass through all the bad railroading topics mentioned. They are the worst because they don't really fix anything and players end up noticing, no matter how good your illusionism and misdirection are. <br/><br/>The best pass through communication and trust: you talk with the players, hear the players, negotiate a common ground. If they are your friends they will understand. You can ask them for time to prep more or a bit of collaboration so things can keep going. It's harder to learn than bad railroading because you have to admit "defeat" (it feels that way at first but we all know it isn't) or "lazyness" (you didn't prep enough and now you don't have anything to throw at them, but nobody should actually need to prep that much to GM). Also, some players can be poor winners, which doesn't really help insecure GMs to learn to communicate more openly.<br/><br/>There are practical ways to get through this too, like impro and random tables, but the best for me were stated in AW principles: Play to find out what happens and Look through Crosshairs (be willing to destroy your own stuff). For me it means that as a GM I can't fall in love with the prep. My mission is to set starting points and introduce some interesting material, but never create perfect solutions or complete scenes. That's the players right and I learned to make that the reason I love the game. I want to see the players surprise me, I want to know what kind of things they do and enjoy a story I couldn't predict as it unfolds before my eyes. So whatever the players want to try, I roll with it and set the difficulty that makes sense for their actions. And they I enjoy the story amazing twists as they unfold.<br/><br/><i>(I've never ended up with way too much gonzo play.

Besides fear, your own principles and tastes may end up getting the best of you. I wrote before about letting the players go GTA with the setting, because by default I can't stand evildoers getting their way in a world I'm authoring, specially the kind that only want to kick dogs for fun or pray on the weak. I'm all for tricksters that defy authority but can't help to make the world rise it's ugly head and send consequences after murderhobos.<br/><br/>I was hoping getting in the GTA mood as a GM could help me deal with it, but haven't been able to test it. Another of my players can't stand when others play evil characters, so we haven't been able to play an evil PC campaign. Perhaps it's for the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472164/#Comment_472164" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T18:42:14+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  6:42PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, lots and lots of us used to use these techniques.

A lovely list.<br/><br/>For me, the concept of Creative Agenda was HUGE in getting past a lot of these hurdles, too. <br/><br/>For instance, WarriorMonk's issues (with murderhobos and such) can easily be fixed if the group can chat about the game and agree about their creative priorities. Like, what are we playing this for? What's the point? Are we celebrating the adventures of heroes, pursuing challenges, trying to win, challenging characters' moral stances, or what?<br/><br/>"Be a fan of the PCs" is a great reminder to stay on board with a mini-Creative Agenda of sorts: we're all here to be fans of the *these* characters. If you understand the implications of that and agree with them as a group, a lot of play problems go out the window immediately. ("Hey, Jim, your character seems to be a murderhobo. We're having trouble being a 'fan' of such a character. Do you want to change the character, make a new one, or are we misunderstanding something about them?" That can be a really fruitful conversation.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472230/#Comment_472230" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T23:42:29+00:00" title="April 17, 2018 11:42PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am totally down with that list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472238/#Comment_472238" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T00:44:23+00:00" title="April 18, 2018 12:44AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 Sandra.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472244/#Comment_472244" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T02:13:51+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  2:13AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what you is meant by being "boringer but more moral."

So it might not be <i>just</i> imitation.<br/><br/>I remember a really interesting game where one player (a newbie to roleplaying) seemed incredibly shy and totally unengaged. I could barely get him to speak up. Well, after a fairly unimportant missed roll (a training fight with his weapons teacher; he was a young prince), I asked him to tell me how his character failed or lost. <br/><br/>He got a really intense look and described losing the fight and throwing away his sword in anger - he got so into the description that he accidentally threw his pen across the room.

If they were to stop fudging it would just be more boring (they believe. more tense, more exciting, more awesome is what we believe)<br/>3. And they think that we're a bunch of prudes who are willing to have boring games and the only reason we flinch at sombunall of the force techniques is that we want to appear moral<br/>4a. And they argue why their way <i>is</i> moral after all, their doing it for the greater good<br/>4b. Or they argue that we need to wake up and smell the coffee, this is how the sausage is being made, earn your salt<br/>4c. Or they accuse us of escalatingly calling them immoral<br/>4d. Or other variations on the theme "this is the only way to do it, to not do to would break the game so stfu"<br/>5d. And I get sucked into the rabbit hole of the new argument that they've successfully created, argue for hours, get really emotional, delete my account on RPGgeek, discover the next morning that that also deleted all of my hundreds of BGG reviews, photos, strategy articles etc etc.<br/><br/>Instead, a new strategy for the "clarity + coherence" team is to show people awesome ways of playing first, and argue against force techniques only after, or in conjunction, with showing the awesome way of playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472253/#Comment_472253" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T05:01:33+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  5:01AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, another great summary!

Lots of naturalistic drifting from moment to moment with no scene framing ensued, as I tried to be less pushy but the players were used to being led.  This wasn't all the time; often a player would take charge for a bit, or I'd slip back into force techniques and make something interesting happen.  But "boringly principled" was definitely a thing.<br/><br/>Obviously there's no inherent connection between GM force and scene framing, but for us back then, "Agree to follow the GM's lead and then cut to the interesting thing the GM wants to show you," was the basic unit of play.  That may not sound like force, but when the alternative is "have no fun at all", it basically was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472306/#Comment_472306" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T14:05:52+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  2:05PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right: second biggest new GM mistake: not being able to manage diegetic time. everything becomes super meandering.

The GM was really god at not railroading us... maybe too good, on this occasion. We were flying around space, looking for [something I don't remember]. The GM rolled up some planets in the current system, and one of them had an ice moon. We decided to go visit the ice moon. The GM said something like, "Are you sure you want to go there? It seems to be uninhabited."<br/><br/>( <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> , note the use of "seems" there! We were talking about that earlier.)<br/><br/>We didn't know what else to do, so we did. Taking off and landing, under those rules, required a Piloting roll. Our Pilot failed miserably, which indicated (according to well-known and established rules - none of this was, or what follows, out of the blue) that a component of the ship was damaged, and that it wouldn't be able to take off without it. Of course, the moon was a ball of ice, totally uninhabited, no breathable atmosphere, totally inhospitable.<br/><br/>There was no way we could fix our engines without supplies or tools, so we were basically stranded there. We continued to play for nearly 4 hours, frantically searching around the ice while the GM, more and more angrily, kept ticking off our remaining oxygen supplies (we had a few hours' worth, from what I recall). Eventually we had to agree that we were all dead; a painful situation for a continuous campaign with characters we had played for about two years.<br/><br/>Everyone was angry; the players were pissed off at the GM, and the GM was almost yelling at us for being such idiots and why oh why did we have to land on that stupid empty planet?!?<br/><br/>Amazing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472344/#Comment_472344" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T15:45:00+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  3:45PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of importance to this thread:<br/><br/>The people involved were mature adults (25-40) and very experienced gamers (with a long-time successful publishing company, no less).<br/><br/>I eventually managed to have lots of fun with them by making sure I GMed the games and didn't show up when someone else was running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472345/#Comment_472345" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T15:45:54+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  3:45PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2018 3:49PM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate hearing that story very much.

It's so much fun to stay in that moment, just for its own sake, that it's easy to let other stuff go by the wayside!  I continue to believe that that sense of transportation is the primary appeal of RPGs for many people.  Unfortunately, once you lose track of everything else, you wind up playing out boring crap at excruciating length.<br/><br/>If you can fast-forward, the "boring" problem goes away.<br/><br/>If you use rules where certain actions always require a roll with a chance of disaster, then you're playing a game in which you have to be very careful about when to perform those actions!  Y'all took a risk despite no promise of safety or reward, and unsurprisingly died for nothing.<br/><br/>I suspect my solution would have been to not use those rules, either eliminating the roll or the disastrous outcome based on other play considerations.  In a game that's run <i>that</i> way, you actually have a reasonable option to land on empty ice balls at a whim.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Obviously the GM could have stepped in and said, "Do not risk breaking your ship for this ice ball.  Your characters are not that stupid.  I forbid this."  But that clearly wasn't part of the group social contract.  Instead, he handled it through the fiction ("seems uninhabited") as per the social contract the group employed, and allowed you all to make a poor risk/reward calculation.<br/><br/>Changing the social contract certainly would have avoided this snafu.  But so would changing the rules-usage, and so would working skillfully with the rules-usage you had.  So, to me, "seems" isn't necessarily part of the problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472349/#Comment_472349" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T16:40:23+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  4:40PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, agree absolutely.

They were very good at allowing characters and players free rein. <br/><br/>I think your observations about transportation and the primacy of the moment are excellent. (Although I think it has to do with following familiar procedures as well - in our case, we weren't entranced in the moment, but we didn't have techniques like "fast forward" in our bandolier of procedures or "how we play".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472352/#Comment_472352" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T17:07:43+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  5:07PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed -- "Do that thing that allows us to be entranced in the moment" becomes habit even if the moment isn't entrancing.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472360/#Comment_472360" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T17:55:15+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  5:55PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I continue to believe that that sense of transportation is the primary appeal of RPGs for many people.</p></div></blockquote>\nI've learned that some players that are very resistant to hard cutting can handle other subtle fastforwarding very well.

current positioning</i>.  <br/><br/>If we skip over my character eating and sleeping and urinating and walking between bed and outhouse, I care 0%.  <br/><br/>But if we skip to the end of the swamp-trek without me deciding whether I'd rather spend more money and carry more food and move slower (so now I'm late and poor but in better shape for a fight) or whether I'd rather not (so now I'm early and wealthy but utterly exhausted), then look out:<br/><br/>Which condition am I in?<br/><br/>Either we go back in time so I can make the decision in sync with my character, which dents the momentum of the fast-forward, or the decision gets made out of sync, which breaks the sense of the character being an extension of the player's self.<br/><br/>Dunno whether this is a problem in all play that prioritizes a sense of transportation, or just for character-POV immersionist challenge gaming...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

But since it was 2 years of campaign with the same characters that sounds like what got established at the beginning was princess play instead. If this was the case:<br/><br/>-The GM handled the data poorly; players should had a more clear course of action ahead or a more interesting destination so they could pick that instead of the ice moon. That doesn't require force, but talking a bit with the players so they make up their minds and lead the way instead of expecting empty planets to suddenly become interesting or fun. --Populating the galaxy with random empty places isn't the same as populating it with interesting and relevant places. That was the downfall of No Man's Sky.<br/>-The GM made a mistake by using a random table to introduce something irrelevant into the setting, as players seem to be used to all things being relevant/interesting or fun.<br/>-It could have been solved by not using the usual procedure and fast forward 4 hours of boring exploration instead. The usual landing procedure generated expectatives that were betrayed when nothing of importance happened.<br/>-The GM could have inserted a random event to keep things going and give the PCs a chance to get back on track. Did something prevent them to send a distress signal?<br/><br/>Otherwise it seems the GM was using the wrong procedures for the type of play that was established.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472376/#Comment_472376" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-18T20:07:07+00:00" title="April 18, 2018  8:07PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I know they knew the <i>chance</i> of it breaking down, that helps make it awesome.

The GM set up a situation on some outer space setting on some planet or other where we had move characters (PCs and NPCs combined) than would fit in some vehicle or other. After 20 minutes of listening to our debate, the GM told us that we could do this in more than one trip. In other words, this wasn't anything critical, and we didn't know this. Sadly, the rest of the game (that we attended) didn't improve; otherwise, I'd have chalked it up to a communications gaffe. These happen.<br/><br/>On the GM side, I was running a pbem, basically urban fantasy set at a strange high school. A couple of students, PCs, were talking about how to deal with a situation that an NPC student had gotten into, and one of the PCs called the NPC student, asking him to come over.<br/><br/>So a move or two later -- this was basically just dialogue, no mechanics -- I had the NPC student show up, basically fast forwarding the time. And one of the players was absolutely not having that -- how had this student JUST HAPPENED to be near enough to just pop in, rather than to come in with the PC? Clearly, he'd been planning to just pop in and was being manipulative or cowardly or otherwise unworthy or respect.<br/><br/>Er, no, I said. The GM was just expediting matters. The player still insisted on time moving forward the way it would be if we played out every moment of everything, and finally I said something on the order of "Okay, fine -- we're rolling this back because I really don't want you blaming the NPC for my attempt to fast forward. Please let me know when he can show up and not get accused of being manipulative."<br/><br/>I could have been more gracious, I suppose, and said, once I understood what had happened, "Sorry, I thought we should fast forward. Let's rewind, and you tell me when you want him to show up." There was no doubt a bit of unintentional bleed on my part, but also general annoyance that I couldn't frame and fast forward. It was a mismatch of expectations and gaming styles, and also communication. I'd have been fine with, "Er, no, we're not finished talking -- could you hold off on that?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472406/#Comment_472406" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T06:44:58+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  6:44AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Lisa Padol" rel="nofollow">Lisa Padol</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>GM told us that we could do this in more than one trip</p></div></blockquote>Since there were so many NPCs there, they could\u2019ve said it.

I'd probably have had the same issue (though hopefully have handled it better) as the player in this example if I was having a conversation and then the GM just said "Okay, Bob shows up..." which implies that no time has passed.  If the GM had said "An hour later, Bob shows up..." I would have been fine with it, but you really need to make it clear that time is passing if time is going to pass.  It's easier if other things are changing. If it's clear you are framing a new scene, because the time and place have changed, those provide the obvious shorthand -- I don't have this problem with "Okay, you arrive at the town." because I don't imagine that I've somehow teleported to reach it, but if everything else is otherwise the same, there needs to be some indication that time has passed.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472438/#Comment_472438" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T13:59:54+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  1:59PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2018 2:03PM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>are you suggesting that you or other people usually cut time without in any way announcing/making it clear that they cut time?</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is going to sound super weird if you haven't met people like this:<br/><br/>I'm saying that there are players who do not want to cut time at all, as weird as it sounds.

That fun might well involve having to solve the problems presented by the GM's scenario, where monsters are there to be slain and problems solved. On the other hand, it might mean letting them go wild in a less constrained manner.<br/><br/>I am currently playing a D&amp;D5 game with a few people who haven't played RPGs much (plus some who have). The GM has just given the ranger her animal companion, a black panther. The girl playing the ranger has decided that the panther must be 'blinged' up with fancy collars, a coat, possibly ear studs and lord alone knows what else. <br/><br/>Now, this is quite obviously not an easy thing to achieve even in a fantasy world and there are surprisingly few 'outfit your panther' shops in the area. The player really wants to play out this whole shopping trip. Does the GM handwave it and say 'fine, your panther is now dressed like a pimp', does he say, 'there are no such outfits available', does he painstakingly make her (and the rest of the party) crawl from shop to shop?<br/><br/>As it turned out, he dealt with it well. The rest of us were (surprisingly) uninterested in playing 'shop for the panther' but were nonetheless happy that the ranger's player was allowed to do so. We split up and played in scene changes, player time here, player time there, and so on, each doing something else. <br/><br/>That shows a GM willing to alter his scenario, willing to deal with a split party, and willing to let a player do something which is bordering on the ridiculous (but insignificant mechanically). The player was delighted and had her fun, the rest of we were happy to take the mickey and have our own time doing 'personal stuff', and the GM then managed to steer the game back on track. Next session we'll do what was planned for the last one.<br/><br/>GMs sometimes have to be hard and wind the players in, but usually they should be resourceful and flexible. Nobody said it was an easy job, but it should be a rewarding one if done right. Angry or frustrated players is not 'going it right', entertaining players enough that they later talk about the session affectionately is spot on. <br/><br/>Ice moons are nasty places to crash, but maybe someone else had also crashed there?

Maybe the wreck has a handful of still-operating security droids who provide a challenge to secure those parts?<br/><br/>No ill-informed player decision should spell disaster for the campaign. Berate the players, have in-game penalties, make them work for the solution, but GMs should not be setting out Gygaxian 'save or die' traps in this day and age of gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472467/#Comment_472467" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T18:37:05+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  6:37PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Probably because you're not a control freak when you play RPGs!

Let's try some new ones.<br/><br/>I consider these two examples basically equivalent:\n<blockquote><b>Example 1</b><br/><br/>"I toss the last bugbear carcass into the chasm."<br/><br/>"Okay.  Bob still hasn't arrived.  What do you do now?"<br/><br/>"I'll sit around until he does."<br/><br/>"Okay.  You sit around for an hour, and then Bob arrives."</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>Example 2</b><br/><br/>"I toss the last bugbear carcass into the chasm."<br/><br/>"Okay.  Bob still hasn't arrived.  What do you do now?"<br/><br/>"I'll sit around until he does."<br/><br/>"Okay.  An hour later, Bob arrives."</blockquote>\n"Cut" vs "elide"/"zoom out" isn't really an issue here because the player got to make a decision about what the character would be doing, and form a vision of that, which accounts for the fictional period we're not playing through.<br/><br/>Some players may still prefer Example 1 over Example 2, but I think the <i>real</i> reason for that is simply this: it's nice for the GM to confirm what that hour was spent doing, like, "Yes, player, I heard you."  <br/><br/>I do not consider either of the above equivalent to the following:\n<blockquote><b>Example 3</b><br/><br/>"I toss the last bugbear carcass into the chasm."<br/><br/>"Okay.  Bob still hasn't arrived.  You sit around for an hour, and then Bob arrives."</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>Example 4</b><br/><br/>"I toss the last bugbear carcass into the chasm."<br/><br/>"Okay, cool.  An hour later, Bob arrives."</blockquote>\nCertain players hate this kind of jump forward because it creates a gap in their experience of character control (Ex. 3), or control and knowledge (Ex. 4), thus breaking identification.  <br/><br/>Adopting a process wherein we "elide" or "zoom out" covers the knowledge issue.  It also makes any control issue explicit: if the GM says, "You sit around," that's an opening for a player to say, "Wait!" and then make an actual decision to sit around or not.<br/><br/>If the details of the original example obfuscate this for you, then I think you should ignore them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472469/#Comment_472469" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T19:16:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  7:16PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, that helps a lot, and ties back to what I was saying earlier:  I'm not a control freak and have no problem with eliding time or cutting scenes, but there needs to be some sort of indicator that it is happening. <br/><br/>Also, in traditional games, it should probably be accompanied by some sort of semi-explicit statement from the players that codes to "we want to move on to the next thing now" -- whether that's "Okay, we go back to town." or "We wait for Bob to arrive." or whatever.

I'm happy to answer them, if people don't mind repeating themselves (or someone can copy and paste them into a new post)!<br/><br/>I'll mention one thing:<br/><br/>Someone said that the group should have been aware of the non-trivial chance of disastrous failure, and, therefore, avoided landing on a moon.<br/><br/>However, "non-trivial" is hard to define here. <br/><br/>Disaster happens on a Piloting critical failure, the odds for which are either just under 2% or, more likely (we probably had a skilled pilot), about 0.4%. That's pretty low.<br/><br/>After that, if I remember correctly, we rolled on some kind of "systems damage" table, which told us that some particular component of the ship was broken and needed repairs. <br/><br/>The procedural moves made to get to this point, in other words, were totally legitimate, and the odds so low that none of us even considered them a possibility (assuming, for instance, a 10% chance of an outcome which can't be repaired on the spot from the "systems damage" table, we're talking about cumulative odds of about 0.04%!).<br/><br/>We had thoroughly scanned the planet before landing, so it was known that it was uninhabited, with no signs of life or technology. I can't remember if we went down because we thought the scanners might have missed something, or because we wanted to grab some ice to study (the Traveller has some "historical" secrets, so archeology is occasionally a thing).<br/><br/>The game was a (generally quite good) sandbox-type thing, so none of that was terribly unusual (and pursuing potentially pointless tangents was definitely something which happened now and then, too, although I didn't love that). It was all pretty routine for the group's playstyle.<br/><br/>I see the failure being the group's absolutely slavish adherence to the procedures of play, to the point where they (we?) were all willing to sacrifice our <i>actual human enjoyment or fun</i> to maintain them. <br/><br/>Worse yet, though, it wasn't a <i>conscious</i> choice. They didn't see it as a choice - it was just, you know, 'how you play RPGs'. (Although the anger people voiced during and afterwards tells me that they/we weren't *really* on board with that as much as they/we might have thought.)<br/><br/>The whole experience was definitely a turning point for me in my gaming history, in any case! <br/><br/><br/>(DannyK: hell, yeah! Or even a new set of characters finding the crash site, if the frozen revival isn't to the players' tastes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472486/#Comment_472486" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T20:46:40+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  8:46PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2018 8:51PM by Airk.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "We don't really understand that we can make a choice here to make our game experience better" phenomenon reminds me of the example here:<br/><br/><a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/37103/what-is-my-guy-syndrome-and-how-do-i-handle-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/37103/what-is-my-guy-syndrome-and-how-do-i-handle-it</a><br/><br/>Hah.

Really would want to run a great space campaign one day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472499/#Comment_472499" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T21:26:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  9:26PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2018 9:27PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The way your campaign was set up, the fidelity with which it was played, sounds awesome to me.</p></div></blockquote>I'm torn.  I like the unbiased simulation.  I like the fact that unlikely things can happen, and that the possibilities aren't arranged for character convenience.  But I dunno about, "Doing routine task X entails microscopic risk Y, which is so unlikely as to be easily forgotten, but if Y happens in situation Z, it's a TPK."  I guess I wouldn't want to just omit that possibility from the Traveller universe entirely, but I do think I'd want to design against the confluence of Y and Z, or give the players a series of rolls and choices as the TPK likelihood increases, or <i>something</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472503/#Comment_472503" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T21:51:10+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  9:51PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2018 9:57PM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well it only takes doing something that has a 0.4% chance 171 times until you've reached 50% chance cumulative.

href="/forums/profile/StoneTharp">@StoneTharp</a> ), one of my great GM buddies whom I'm so grateful to have met, often asks people who say 4d if they've ever tried it the other way: rolling in the open, and sticking to whatever the dice say, no matter what. What's so interesting is that they often refuse to answer! But obviously, they haven't.<br/><br/>And they absolutely refuse to listen to those of us who have run hundreds of sessions that way. It's like they think we're lying. Very exhausting. And a big part of the reason for my cynicism in that other thread.</blockquote>\nJust seeing this now! I should mention that my tactic of asking that has only been partially successful. It has given me a lot of insight into how many Force-reliant GMs literally don't have any firsthand idea what the alternative looks like. So that's kind of a success? But it's certainly never yet proved persuasive to anyone I've gotten sucked down the rabbit hole with (and Sandra, I increasingly feel similarly to you about your idea focusing on being awesome first and arguing against Force Techniques only later or in conjunction). The question I find most interesting, and about which I have no data, is whether it's ever been persuasive or at least eye-opening to others reading the exchanges where I've done it. I have no idea. I <i>hope</i> it has been, but...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472606/#Comment_472606" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T04:25:00+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  4:25AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like, I think that's part of why I like Clint's approach so much in his video. He is presenting it as a variant almost. He teaches how to prep, what attitude to take to rules, and then it's like he's saying that in the variant that he proposes, don't fudge and don't prep events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472649/#Comment_472649" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T21:21:18+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  9:21PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, what video are you referring to?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21588/the-importance-of-be-a-fan-of-the-pcs/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21588/the-importance-of-be-a-fan-of-the-pcs">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21588/the-importance-of-be-a-fan-of-the-pcs/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21588/the-importance-of-be-a-fan-of-the-pcs/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21588%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21588%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
