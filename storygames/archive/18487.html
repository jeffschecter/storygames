Sort of a strange version of "keys" and character specific quests.<br/><br/>Just that alone made me excited to add more to my backing, and is making me think of ways to add the XP system to other game systems I already run - I adore how their are basically "genre specific" keys that everyone contributes to to get shared XP, and then character quests and "arcs" of quests that improve your character in specific ways.<br/><br/>K                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416650/#Comment_416650" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T09:48:52+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  9:48AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've donated, and I'm about half way through the draft.<br/><br/>I've always liked Keys, and these sort of group generic keys I think will work well to direct the group.  I like the quests idea so far.  There still a lot I need to get my head around, and the draft jumps around a little.

The worked examples Ms. Moran's put out made some of the ideas clearer. The XP and the genres encourage specific types of stories/events in the near term, while the Arcs are where your character's going (both mechanical advancement and their story-arc) in general.<br/><br/>I've been dying to do a Persona 3-type RPG forever, and I've toyed with hacks of various systems, including Panty Explosion, Apocalypse World. Chuubo's the latest. It just seems perfect: the "at school" part of the game is Pastoral. During the Dark Hour, you're in Adventure Fantasy. Then, once per month (since Chuubo's really good for keeping track of "now it's next week"), you hit a Full Moon, and suddenly you're on the Road of Trials. And it seems to me that the Tarot/Arcana of the Personas should map wonderfully to the Arc types.<br/><br/>Dunno how well the game will work in real-life, but it sounds great on paper.  That said, I showed it to some of my fellow players and Pastoral play just seemed to fly entirely over their heads. "Watching a Hayao Miyazaki film about pastoral, country life in rural Japan is one thing. PLAYING it, though?" seemed to be the general response.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416678/#Comment_416678" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T18:28:09+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  6:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know Buddha has been all over this draft, so lemme see if I can get him to comment here.

I have read a couple of the playbooks, and they already kind of make my head spin (and firm up my suspicion that the reason Nobilis 3 seemed so undercooked is because she was already thinking about making this game instead).<br/><br/>Don't forget <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/336494#Comment_336494" rel="nofollow">Ryuutama</a> is due out this year too.
