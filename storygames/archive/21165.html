When playing games like Lady Blackbird, City of Mists or FU that essentially allow you to stack tags for dice rolls, often <i>the game flow is interrupted</i> by players searching for any applicable tags they can find. <br/><br/>2.) Also in my experience <i>counting tags leads to unbalanced results consistently</i>.<br/>For example, a fighter has "just" a magic sword and gets a +1. Another PC attacks with a pocket knife and has some applicable tags, gets a +4. <del> In the fiction, though, this makes no sense.</del> It's ok if the underdog pulls off something surprising occasionally.

You let your aspects / FoRKs do the talking. They're like Lego pieces. The language of the game, then, is no longer plain English. Maybe that PC with the pocket knife, <i>because</i> of the applicable tags, is more likely to cause harm than the magic sword. And that's 100% appropriate in the genre the system is designed to emulate. The "show" <small>(as much as it pains me to think of RPG as a TV show)</small> has "established" that the knife fighter is fighting sober, having the wind on their side, have the moral support of someone they've sought validation from etc. <br/><br/>The book of Samuel does the same thing when David is prepping to fight Goliath. It makes clear to establish that he's killed a bear and a lion, and it shows him trying to wear armor, a helmet and a sword that he rejects since they impede his movement to much. It shows him selecting five stones, worn smooth from the stream.<br/><br/>That's how the "narrative physics" work in these games. "One in a million chances succeed nine times out of ten" in Pterry's words.<br/>Establish, use. Establish, use. Etc.<br/><br/>In 5e, advantage is often bigger than +1.<br/>In Blades, position, effect, and push/help/bargain are three axes with complex interrelationships on probability.<br/>In Fate, invocations are pretty straight forward.<br/><br/>They are "fiction last" using the definition of "fiction" only being the natural langugae expression of the diegetic shared imagined space. They're not if you have a more mimetic view of the SIS.<br/><br/>Like, in dice/cloud terms\u2026 are these extra FoRK dice right-pointing arrows? Yes. They are added to the pool <i>because</i> the SIS made them applicable, even when that applicability isn't <i>expressed</i> in natural language narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463831/#Comment_463831" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T07:14:31+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  7:14AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" rel="nofollow">BeePeeGee</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What I do usually as GM is basically use the tags as "vague indicators" but essentially decide myself how many dice I grant.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's going against how the game is supposed to work, which is narrative "physics" over physics physics.<br/><br/>At that point, why are you playing the game?

I've changed my original post accordingly.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with the "fiction last play style" itself.<br/>When playing Fate or Blades in the Dark, I don't have this problem at all:<br/>In Fate, as a baseline you start with a skill/approach and <i>then</i> modify that based on i.e. aspects. Also, the use of aspects is limited because it costs an action (create advantage) or a Fate point (your example of David vs Goliath would be David investing a lot of "create advantages" prior to the fight, then invoking them all).<br/>In Blades, by choosing the appropriate position (controlled/risky/desperate) the GM keeps the result in an adequate ballpark. And if you use a Devil's Bargain, you pay for it.<br/><br/>I have this problem in games like Lady Blackbird, FU, City of Mist. <br/>Here, you could have i.e. Dwayne Johnson "The Rock" wrestling Kermit "The Frog".<br/>Dwayne has +1 for "super strong", Kermit has +4 for "long arms", "stealth green", "frog legs" and "big eyes".<br/>It just <i>feels wrong</i> that Kermit the Frog goes into the fight +4 vs +1 <i>by default</i>.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463835/#Comment_463835" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T09:35:32+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  9:35AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Good rephrase.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s about establishing what we see.

A common terminology for talking about this issue is to talk about "freely formed traits" (as the players get to pick whatever traits they want) with "formalized mechanical weight" (as the traits have simple pre-defined mechanical weight) and "universal conflict resolution mechanics" (as there's just one set of rules for solving all sorts of situations, and traits are simply fed into that system to get a result). <i>Heroquest</i> is perhaps the most emblematic and clear example of a game like this, but there's a whole bunch of games out there that use this particular mechanical approach.<br/><br/>A common element in these kinds of games is to accept that the players are <i>genuinely responsible</i> for what they put down on their character sheets. If you put down "my race car is red +100", then it's on you if being red gives a +100 to winning races. The only one who can prevent forest fires - and maintain sensibility in a free trait system - is you. This is true even if the game puts limits on how many traits you can have and how high their mechanical weights can be - the fact that the system lets you write your own traits means that it's impossible for anybody except the play group to police that those traits are "sensible".<br/><br/>Another common element is that the game has a specific set of rules for trait scoping and applicability. For example, the game might say that "Strong as an ox" applies to a given situation better than "Long arms", and therefore the character using the former gets some sort of advantage over the latter. Or, another example, the game might say that you can only use traits that apply clearly and unequivocally to the situation. It all depends on how, precisely, the game applies traits to conflicts.<br/><br/>But in truth, there's a whole bunch of rules detail that goes into this stuff. For example, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> relies on rather arbitrary scoping, and gets away with it due to sharply diminishing mathematical returns: the second and third trait you add to the conflict have less and less impact on the outcome, and therefore players don't generally bother with it too much. Meanwhile, Dust Devils says that you can only apply one trait, the one best fit to the situation - again, it avoids most complications. <i>Tales of Entropy</i> basically just treats the trait thing as arbitrary narrative color for the fact that the player's gonna get roughly as many dice as he wants anyway, so we just need them to explain a bit about where those dice come from.<br/><br/>So I'd say that there's a whole continuum of subtle techniques that games use to improve the play experience in this kind of free-trait formal conflict resolution system games, but which ones specifically are in use depends on the specific game. Learn the game you play well, and pay attention to how others get it to lift its weight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463841/#Comment_463841" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T13:52:04+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  1:52PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the issue isn't just whether the traits apply.

A 10+ fight roll where you rolled at +4 has a +4 effect (a serious injury), while a 10+ where you got lucky at +1 has only a +1 effect (a scratch). <br/><br/>It strongly incentivizes players to tag spam, and makes rolling at low Power almost useless.<br/><br/>The system seems dubious at best.<br/><br/>Anyway, on a brighter note, in Lady Blackbird at least, there's a few subtle controls. Very few characters have tags which stack in large quantities together easily. (Naomi's Pit Fighter is one of the exceptions, and it represents how just awe-inspiringly badass she is). Always/Never/Now I think missed this, and it led to a lot more easy tag stacking.<br/><br/>In general, as a GM, other than just being willing to acknowledge that occasionally you will push back a bit in LB, I think rewarding people for more precise actions with lower difficulties is your key lever. Fighting a big group of marines in the Hand of Sorrow is a 5 difficulty. Tricks or clever plans may have a lot lower difficulty. The more tags a person brings in, the broader the action, but also consider that the scope of the enemy's response grows broader.<br/><br/>Similarly, each tag can imply fictional consequences: Kale can use Repair, Efficiency, Spare Parts, but now their cache of spare parts is gone. If they want to drag in Sabotage, well, what did they sabotage, etc, etc. If Kale is being Quiet, Sneaking, Hiding, and Perceptive, it's unlikely anybody else can follow along with that, and he's on his own.<br/><br/>In the end, I think tag spamming isn't a big deal for LB, especially given that it's only a session or two. But I think part of that is the tag design is very precise and controlled.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463849/#Comment_463849" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T19:00:32+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  7:00PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the problem necessarily is with 'silly tags' like big eyes beating 'hard tags' like super strength.

It's one of those mechanics that's too universal for its own good. I suspect that the best results with it can be achieved in some sort of limited context (maybe the game forces you to select from a limited set of tags or something).<br/><br/>I'd love to give some advice on City of Mists, because this sort of design is right up my alley, but I've no idea about that game in the specific. As a general observation, though: if the game just piles on freeform trait bonuses on top of a 2d6 roll, and there's no disadvantage or cost to doing so, there needs to be other, firm and real limitations to answer why a player wouldn't just whine their way into adding every trait their character's got. Usually for games that don't have anything particularly clever going for them in that department it's gonna be group standards: you write reasonable, useful traits, and you apply them consistently and clearly. No "stretches" (as Heroquest calls it when you apply a trait with weak justification).<br/><br/>That sort of "naive" free-trait play can work well, but it truly needs to be economical: few traits, more important traits stronger than the less important ones, and no piling weakly associated traits into the conflicts. An individual conflict should look like "master swordsman" + "at home on a ship" vs "flight magic" + "master slinger" rather than a cavalcade of "but I mentioned my character's red backpack, so I should get the points for my fancy backbag trait" whining. And yeah, if the system assigns mechanical weight to the individual traits, the actually more important traits should be assigned higher numbers than the bullshit ones.<br/><br/>And of course all that does nothing for the fact that most free-trait games have in-built attenuation effects, while a system that simply adds bonuses linearly on top of a bell curve dice roll actually causes further bonuses to be <i>more</i> effective. Practically all functional games with loosey-goosey dicing modifiers have attenuation: either it's a dice pool where adding even more dice has less proportionate impact, or the order the traits are added in matters to favour the early ones, or you pay incrementally more juice the more traits you add. It's a major issue for the overall game design, and should be considered very carefully.<br/><br/>No idea if the specific game you're pondering about suffers from these sorts of issues. If it does, it's not that difficult to fix - there's many ways to do it, really, just depends on what one likes to do. For example, you could say that "stretch" traits are always only worth a +1 in total regardless of how many or how big they are, and only traits that are central to the situation (in the GM's judgement) are worth their full value. This would effectively mean that most characters in most situations get one trait at full value, +1 for having some bullshit traits they force into the situation - but they don't need to force more than one to get that full bonus, and there's no need to do lengthy beg-and-whine routines to collect every little bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463855/#Comment_463855" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T00:48:55+00:00" title="June 12, 2017 12:48AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree:<br/><br/>These sound like design issues in the games being played.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, in my own Lady Blackbird play I use a hack which makes the number of Tags used far less important.

It looks good so far, though there's no telling how it will end up in the final draft.<br/><br/>It describes "Specific" tags as being useful in one of three (or two of three in specific ways) types of scenes; Investigation, Action, or Dialog.  "Broad" tags are useful in two of the three types of scenes, and "Too Broad" tags are tags that are basically useful all the time. A player is allowed to have one Broad tag, but the rest are supposed to be specific. <br/><br/>Of course, it says the GM can approve whatever, but it also has some guides for either making tags more specific, or allowing broader tags with restricted use (the PC and GM would agree that the tag needs a Change the Game move to "activate" it). <br/><br/>Again, it's still in playtest, so there may be more or less or different stuff when it's released.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jeridas" title="jeridas"><img alt="jeridas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jeridas">jeridas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463950/#Comment_463950" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T09:14:18+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  9:14AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A really good discussion you guys are having here.

Also I've been prepping Cthulhu Dark which has a similar mechanic.<br/><br/>So two concerns. First of all:<br/>12.5% of 1\u20133 at 3, 6.25% of 1\u20133  at 4? Hmm\u2026<br/>Maybe. In Blades, a 4-5 is often <i>very</i> punishing. Depending on the position, you can die on a 5. Is that the case in City of Mist, too?<br/><br/>Second, you lose the moves-as-written. You can no longer take the part of the game text that reads 7\u20139 and literally take it as "seven" to "nine". If you are going to stray from the CoM texts that far, you might as well port the game over to any good mechanic that gives you partials (like Fate, Blades [as you suggest], other systems are possible too).<br/><br/><a href="http://anydice.com/program/c01e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://anydice.com/program/c01e</a><br/>Here's your program, jeridas, followed by 1d12+power vs 7-9 / 10+, followed by 1d12 + power vs 7-11 / 12+.<br/><br/>Just swapping 1d12 for the 2d6 seems like the quickest but dirtiest fix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jeridas" title="jeridas"><img alt="jeridas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jeridas">jeridas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463969/#Comment_463969" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T17:13:27+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  5:13PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry if I wasn't clear about the intention of my post.

I hope that was within scope of the question.  <br/><br/>You are completely right about the vanishing 6- results and the totally different ranges.  In my opinion it's still a better compromise then having the 7-9 results at a constant 25% and a much higher spread of the distribution ( which still might feel alright at the table). Most importantly at 3 tags the 1d12+X would still have a 25% chance of a 6- result (standard PbtA would be at 8.3%).

3) but would rather prefer a 4 or a 5 than a 6.<br/><br/>I'm quite sure that this idea can be adapted to other systems as well (in Cthulhu Dark, getting a 6 while investigating triggers an Insight roll).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464073/#Comment_464073" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T14:36:39+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  2:36PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna" rel="nofollow">CarlosLuna</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm arriving way too late to the discussion, but let me suggest adding a <i>blackjack-like</i> mechanic to your game to avoid the "tag-hoarding effect".</p></div></blockquote>\nI love this. <br/><br/>Ron Edwards and Raymond Chandler used a similar concept for their <a href="http://adept-press.com/wordpress/wp-content/media/Supervillain-You-plain-draft.pdf" rel="nofollow">Supervillain You</a> game. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464082/#Comment_464082" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T16:59:06+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  4:59PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed!<br/><br/>I used this in my game <i>Inconceivable</i>, and it adds a nice balancing factor to this sort of player choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464115/#Comment_464115" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-17T05:49:54+00:00" title="June 17, 2017  5:49AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2017 5:52AM by BeePeeGee.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> , I like the idea of having to fit your tags into a (meaningful) sentence, thanks.<br/><br/>Carlos' proposal reminds me of Paul's  "Oracle".<br/><br/>Yes, the number of relevant tags seems to be a good way for balancing. <br/>Let's say you can choose 4 tags.
