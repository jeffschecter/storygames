If you don't like the Matrix franchise nor find any story value in it's celuloid then PLEASE, PLEASE don't participate in this thread.  I am not really cool with you airing your disatisfaction or critique.  Start another thread if you want to talk about that stuff.  Thanks!***<br/><br/>I adore the Matrix.  I know this isn't Knife Fight and not about delving into our darkest secrets or airing our dirty laundry but THERE, I said it.  I love everything about it.  <br/><br/>I get a thrill watching these films, reading the comics, playing the games.  I can't get enough.<br/><br/>I am watching the second film and te temple scene - I get chills over Morpheus's St. Crispin's Day Speech, I get a rise out of the dancing sequence.  I love the spiritual overtones and the hard-tech of Zion. <br/><br/>I want, no NEED, to play the Matrix game.  And no traditional ruleset will do.  I need a Matrix Story Game.  Who's gonna help me?<br/><br/>So lets start with this:<br/>What themes can we explore?  What are the central principles?  What is the Matrix? ... or more importantly what sort of stories need to be told?  <br/><br/>I don't want to talk about mechanics yet.  I'd like to explore those themes.  No doubt the different movie have different things to say.  i'm cool with that.  Let's take these movies apart (in a constructive and loving way) and see what sorts of stories lie there.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144323/#Comment_144323" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T17:52:25+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:52PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assume we are including the Animatrix then?

Thanks!<br/><br/>Animatrix included?  Hell, yes.  I don't think the movies stand by themselves at all.  I think to get what's going on you have to immerse in all the media.  I'm even cool doing that with a game - like little SG subsystems talking about different themes and a "glue" system that ties it all together and allows them to affect one another.<br/><br/>Callan's Questions:<br/>I don't know that's possible aside from the idea that there is a littled pool of macro-plots.<br/>Now if it were a solid SG, there might be some limit to what can be told.  I mean there's probably a finite number of Mountain Witch or MLWM games, but on a practicle level after playing each of those games a dozen times I still have ideas.  So it's hard to relate to your question to answer it effectively.<br/><br/>Are you asking if I want and endgame?  Absolutely.  I am a structure kinda guy.  I am not a "lets wallow in the setting in adnauseum" kinda SGer.  If we were to tell a story about "Will the real Chosen One Please Stand Up" then the game would end when we find the chosen one.  Do I want some rambling epic?  Hell no.  I can tell vignettes until the cows come home.  As long as they are contained compelling stories inspired by the setting I'm happy.<br/><br/>The Animatrix is an excellent persepctive.  I could totally see a "campaign" being a compilation of stories about different characters all tied together by an event or a theme.  There are so many themes going on I'd like to find the ones I'd be interested in persuing.<br/><br/>I wonder if it would be interesting to have shifting authorship roles - sometimes the machines are incontrol and sometimesthe humans are in control.<br/><br/>Does that stuff answer your questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144483/#Comment_144483" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T11:56:24+00:00" title="May 16, 2008 11:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, eruditus, I'd love to see how you'd set the game: In Neo's era, with no Neo (so that the PCs can All Be Neo instead)? Before those events? After? It's kind of the problem in media where "The World Ends, And Everyone Knows It", and I guess the question is how much is that part of the movie Canon?<br/><br/>So, I can't help too much on the story aspect, but here's a die trick that may help you.<br/><br/>I designed a d6-based Matrix game after I saw the movie, back when I was living in Japan. Played it a few times, lotsa fun. Here's how I handled People vs Agents. You have to know d6 Star Wars to get this though (I based my game on that one):<br/><br/>Humans used all d6es for rolls, and could use Force Points and the like to double their dice (to simulate that "we can think outside of the box" effect).<br/><br/>Agents stats looked very similar to the PCs or other characters: But they used d10s for all their rolls, all the time: They are the pinnacle of "human" power within the confines of the code.<br/>And, here's the kicker, they could not use Force Points or the like: The are powerful overall, but can not "get outside the box". <br/><br/>So, gross advantage goes to the Agents, but there are those rare moments when a human can kick their asses, given enough Force Points saved up (I think I called them "Matrix Points" or something)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144521/#Comment_144521" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T13:26:39+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  1:26PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might be close to useless to non-spanish speakers, but I share <a href="http://www.salganalsol.com/foro/comments.php?DiscussionID=279&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this link</a> so you know you are not alone in your crusade.

I really wonder if this has any themes to explore beyond the same kind of suspicion about the world around them theme presented in Beyond.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Kid's Story</b><br/>\n<i>- Neo sends cryptic messages to a kid, opening his eyes to the matrix</i><br/>\nSo this really is just like A Detective Story in heart, with the main difference being the feel and the attitude of the person who is being targeted by Neo. Same theme with a lot more emo + rebellious spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Matriculated</b><br/>\n<i>- A rogue group attempts to educate AI machines with positive human traits</i><br/>\nThis is also one of my favorite three, and has pretty interesting ideas. Here we are exploring the nature of the machine AI, something that is almost untouched upon in the whole franchise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Program</b><br/>\n<i>- Rogue crew member runs a loyalty test 'program' on a fellow shipmate</i><br/>\nI liked this one a lot, but it just missed my top three. Here we are using the virtual existence program in a very cunning manner, something more interesting than the rather dry approaches made in the movies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>World Record</b><br/>\n<i>- Top athlete with the ability to see the matrix learns a tough lesson</i><br/>\nYea, I can't help it, this one is my favorite even in the top three. It really speaks out to unlimited strength of the human spirit, esp. in resistance to oppression. This is one of the major themes in pretty much all the movies and much of the franchise. We also get to see how the matrix works on the inside, how people play down the freak occurrence so that it fits into their world view (he must have been on drugs, and so on).<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I left out the other three. I pretty much hate Final Flight and don't think it should have been in the collection at all, and I would have to go back and watch The Second Renaissance with a notebook to accurately surmise themes there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144740/#Comment_144740" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T13:18:41+00:00" title="May 18, 2008  1:18PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JP, that's just what I was looking for!

You know in the end your not going to write rules for someone elses beloved theme, when they aren't going to put any effort into that themselves*. And your not going to explore your own except in what interests you in someone elses theme. The only thing that'll be produced is a shared imagined space about matrix themes, which will fall apart once participants leave because of that reason above (with the asterix). This is just (simulationist) gaming. Or to put it in a more negotiable form, I see this as just gaming in a thread, so I'll catch you latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
