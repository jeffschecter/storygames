But I know and love Demons Souls (although I gave up and sold my copy, I may one day buy it again).<br/><br/>What's in StWT that evokes Demons Souls? Is there features for:<br/><br/>* DS's level of total butthurt brutality? (one stroke kills etc)<br/>* Respawning, ghosts, etc?<br/>* Crafting?<br/><br/>Just curious if there was more to it than using the setting of Dark Souls (basically Western Fantasy, but dark and brutal; likely German) with another game rules? Break it down for me!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363838/#Comment_363838" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T10:11:44+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 10:11AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It came out through a long discussion about gaming. StWT has a lot of awesome in it, but I will have to sit down tonight and reread it to remember what. <br/><br/>Besides that what actually lead us to this discussion was interesting dice mechanics. One that we felt would work great for a game like Demons Souls was "Momentum Dice",  essentially after every confrontation you get more and more dice to roll. But, eventually you must stop and recover, thus losing all of those extra dice. The mechanic essentially encourages you to push beyond what you really should, because you need those dice to win at many points. <br/><br/>I think this "could" translate to a game of StWT, but I am not sure if something like Dungeon World, or even something more traditional would be best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363857/#Comment_363857" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T11:00:39+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 11:00AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>Besides that what actually lead us to this discussion was interesting dice mechanics.

Sounds like fun.
