The era is one in which the opinions of literary figures are considered important. I think I've got the beginning of something very interesting here, but I don't think I have the skill to develop it.)<br/><br/>Looking at settings for DramaSystem, a couple passages from a couple settings stuck out to me:<br/><br/>From \u201cThe Champion of Florence:\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIf [the players want to adhere to Shakespearean conventions] characters of no particular visual distinction except for their youth, vitality, and general attractiveness can disguise themselves effectively and with no great effort. With a simple change of dress, perhaps a prop or two, and maybe a false mustache, a noble may pose as a peon or a woman as a man.\u201d<br/><br/>From \u201cBattle of Wits:\u201d<br/><br/>This male dominated world [of influential writers] still grants ample room for female PCs. The leading poets and dramatists were men but women had huge success as novelists: Henry Fieldings classic Joseph Andrews was outsold by his sister\u2019s David Simple. Also, pseudonyms and anonymous publishing were widespread; Jonathan Swift published almost all of his work anonymously. The true identity and gender of these authors provoked great rumour and debate.\u201d<br/><br/>And then I thought of tavern-keeper.com, which is designed to keep track of campaigns, including text rp that happens between sessions, and which seems to do that well. In a game about writers, you could post excerpts from your character\u2019s work.<br/><br/>I feel like there\u2019s something to be made from these three things. Playing as marginalized characters who maintain a separate identity and who speak with power through a nom de plume could be really interesting, especially if you can write little excerpts from their work between sessions. I really don\u2019t know how to set this up, though.<br/><br/>I do have a few ideas about settings:<br/><br/>- the Shakespearian one of \u201cThe Champion of Venice\u201d<br/>- an ancient Athens-based one dealing with the contrast between the role of hetaerae (courtesans) who were expected to be suitable companions for men of learning socially and wives, who weren\u2019t even supposed to leave home if they could help it<br/>- a medieval one contrasting courtly love and the ideal of chivalry with the bloody reality of day to day life<br/><br/>But then I have no idea what to do with this. Any advice?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444584/#Comment_444584" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T19:15:02+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  7:15PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Well, you could run a game where this is the premise?<br/><br/>In other words, I am not sure what kind of advice you are looking for. This does indeed seem like a great set-up for a game. I would pick the setting you find most interesting, gather some players, and try playing it. The part where you write as your PC between sessions seems... ambitious... but could be great if people get into it. If that is central to your vision of the game then you might need to do some work tying it in to the rest of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444586/#Comment_444586" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T19:23:16+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  7:23PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a fantastic premise. I've often daydreamed about playing an RPG where the pen is mightier than the sword. Where publishing a book -a manifesto, a work of art, a song, a poem, an essay - can change the world dramatically.<br/><br/>My initial reaction is the opposite of IceCreamEmperor's:<br/><br/>Make the entire game about writing "in-character". The entire game consists of nothing but letters from one character to another, excerpts from published works, and art/projects created by the authors.<br/><br/>There are a few good novels which are written this way: there is no prose. The entire novel is just presented as a collection of letters from one person to another - or several people to each other. Kind of like reading a diary, or going through someone's mail.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John" title="Virginian_John"><img alt="Virginian_John" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nK0KBJPN6LXY5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John">Virginian_John</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444592/#Comment_444592" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T01:02:01+00:00" title="April  6, 2015  1:02AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2015 1:02AM by Virginian_John.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a><br/>There is a RPG called "De Profundis" by Michal Oracz and published by Cubicle 7 Entetainment around 2010.
