Everything's either 10 minutes or 40 minutes away, in the Triangle; so having a final night clot end at midnight and the first slot the next day start at nine means some folks don't get a full night's sleep. Sure, that's true of most cons. But still....<br/><br/>* Public spaces and conventions centers have some things that some homes lack: seating for multiple groups of 4 to 6 people; easy-to-access, on-demand refreshments; more than two toilets; parking--in general, support for comfortable gatherings of more than 10 people. Therefore, I would definitely try to hit up the richest gamers in the area. That said, I know a couple that does monthly board game nights that host upwards of 30 people (by having a LOT of folding chairs and tables, and using every square foot of "public" space). Perhaps the "con committee" could get a van and rent some tables and chairs and transport them nightly?<br/><br/>* Did you consider having the house cons going in all three houses, all weekend? Bigger, better, bolder, themed (i.e. each house would focus on one third of the interests for the con overall). Of course, then it's really just three simultaneous house cons with narrower themes, I reckon.<br/><br/>* If you were thinking LARP, this would be easy and PREFECT for a weekend-long game. Then, you've got the whole property to use, and less of a demand for table space.<br/><br/>Sounds like fun, though. re you thinking public invites or private con? (The former has its own associated issues, as anyone who's thrown a kegger can attest.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216966/#Comment_216966" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T11:17:43+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 11:17AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Playing different games with each other, via Skype.

I know people who play in mixed human/cybertron groups, too, with one or more players on the wrong side of the Atlantic.  So you could have a "robot head" seat at each table and invite remote people to robot in on sessions.  I don't want to mess with the technical end of that but I know people who might.<br/><br/>Thanks for the ideas, everybody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217031/#Comment_217031" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T14:01:24+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  2:01PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great idea.  A local over 2.5 days - the 'drop-in' aspect you and Andy touched on actually appeals to me.   I know I could get to at least one if not all.  Spreading out the work among several people is appealing too.   The local part is very appealing as I would have trouble with an out of town trip.  I like the idea of deluging a local eatery in the evening to get to know people.  Being local to you, please let me know if this happens.  I'm really itching for some indie gaming right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
