                    All the posting on the Game Chef forums this week has got me thinking about  ways of giving feedback. Especially as - if I understand this correctly - the Game Chef entrants will be reviewing the entries soon.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, when you give feedback on someone else's game, do you have any rules for yourself that you follow? I've noticed some people seem to make a point of asking questions rather than stating their opinion; some people state directly what the game is missing; some look for holes in the rules ("what happens if..."). What's the content of your feedback and do you have any special way of phrasing it?<br/>
<br/>
And some specific questions too:<br/>
<br/>
1. Should you give feedback on writing style? For example, if you read a paragraph three times and couldn't understand it, would you say so?<br/>
<br/>
2. If called to give feedback on a game you didn't particularly like, how would you do it?<br/>
<br/>
3. How do you handle a situation - which seems to happen quite a lot - where the setting idea is great but the mechanics are either unwritten or very light or they don't support the desired play style?<br/>
<br/>
Do feel free to use this thread as a general dumping ground for ideas on giving feedback. Any ideas would be very useful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Graham<br/>

                            First of all Graham, this is a great topic.<br/><br/>Second of all, I thought you gave good and useful feedback on my game last year.<br/><br/>Feedback is an awkward subject and I think a lot depends on your relationship with the recipient.  I tend to keep my feedback positive and questioning in general with people I know only slightly.  I wouldn't, for example, tell a virtual stranger that i didn't like their game.  It's not helpful, really.  <br/><br/>With people I know a little better, I'll certainly provide more hard-nosed feedback, but I try to ask what parameters will be productive for them.  Some people copy edit at the end and don't want to be told they are making grammar mistakes, and others may want that pointed out.  Regarding mechanics, I actively try to break them whenever I can, and I think this is one of the most helpful things you can do - provided you announce your intention.<br/><br/>Everyone responds to criticism differently, so I think just establishing what will be useful to the author is the best way to approach feedback.  That way you've got an understanding and won't injure anyone's pride.                        </div>

                            My 2 cents: think really hard about why the good things are good and talk about them a whole lot. It's easy to find problems.                        </div>

                            Also, look at the "Iron Game Destroyer" thread from the 1km1kt forums from last year.<br/><br/>That was so influential and substantive to what the contest was for, and encouraged so much further feedback spinoff, that I decided that this behavior would be rewarded this year.  I'm giving prizes to the "top three feedbackers".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Thanks. Jason, good comment on the relationship with the feedback's recipient. I'd hardly considered that and it's important.<br/>
<br/>
Matt, that's useful advice. Personally speaking, though, it's incredibly useful when people find problems with my game. They give me something specific to go and fix.<br/>
<br/>
Andy, the Iron Game Destroyer threads were great. I've been reading through Tobias' old posts and trying to work out how he wrote them. It seems to go something like this:<br/>
<br/>
1. He often starts with an honest compliment of what he liked about the game<br/>
2. He points out bugs in the game or omissions ("What happens if...")<br/>
3. He points out if something is unclear or appears to be missing in the text<br/>
4. He says if he's worried about an aspect of play and often says that playtesting will resolve the issue one way or the other<br/>
5. On writing style, he does give comments such as "The text needs proofreading (but is gripping)" or "Clearer IIEE is needed". This works fine but I think it does so because he has a previous relationship with the recipient of the feedback (Jason's point): it's not the sort of feedback you'd give on a first draft someone had posted.<br/>
<br/>
My personal rules on feedback, for what they're worth. Since I know little about the theory, I try to avoid theoretical terms (other people will explain the theory side much better than me). <br/>
<br/>
If I'm giving feedback on a set of rules, then, I come from the point of view of "Could I run a game tomorrow using this ruleset?". If I couldn't, then I ask the questions I need to ask in order to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I often recommend people read other games, which have mechanics I feel they would find useful. <br/>
<br/>
I have a policy that, if a post has zero replies after a day or so, I'll try and reply to it. Often, of course, the post is quite hard to reply to: perhaps it's just a description of setting. A lot of these replies take the form "I like X - could you tell me more about Y?". With posts which are all about setting, I'll say what I like about the setting, and then say I'm interested to read the mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, do use this thread as a dumping ground for thoughts on feedback, if you have them. I'm still interested in responses to the three situations above.<br/>

                            To riff on Graham's last post: All feedback is good feedback.<br>
<br>
The moment we post our shit up for feedback we are entering a social agreement where we know we'll get pointed at its weak underbelly. If we're aware of it, cool, if we aren't, also cool.<br>
<br>
I also agree on replying to unreplied posts. Nothing sucks more than watching you put up the result of your spent time and imagination and seeing that evidently no one cares.<br>
<br>
I tend not to reply on writing style, I can understand posters who use zero punctuation, I'm sure others will point at that aspect. Unless the meaning is obtuse and then I point it out.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Especially in game design, I find it is very useful to start off describing the kind of game that you would expect to play and the kind of game that you would like to play using that design.  While this may sound like just parroting back what the designer wrote, this establishes an essential baseline so that everybody can get on the same page.  It can also turn up very interesting discrepancies between what the designer wrote and the reviewer read -- he might have written a game about space exploration and you're all excited about meeting aliens, and that's good things to know both in general and in terms of contextualizing the ensuing review.<br/><br/>I don't soften the blow or try and couch all my criticisms in qualifiers.  If something is unclear or broken or adolescent masturbatory fantasy, I say so.  On the other hand, if I do my job right, these criticisms are side-by-side with me gushing about the parts that I'm really excited about.  So I end up writing things like "I totally dig on supporting your character's core beliefs with a trio of their skills, and think that's going to lead to some stellar introspective roleplay, but the mechanic linking abilities to beliefs is a pretty weak support system for such a powerful mechanic."<br/><br/>And I cannot agree enough with Jason that you've got to find out what kind of feedback you're supposed to be giving.  There's a mammoth difference between copyediting, content editing, and playtesting, and I'm of the opinion that you should not even try to do them at the same time.                        </div>
