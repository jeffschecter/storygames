From the reading looks like fun though getting control aka becoming gm can happen only after the lots of sessions. Players must first get enough points. Other fun things:<br/>\n- gm has its own character in the game,<br/>\n- the scenario is semi structured - gm chooses the agenda (killing player character, subvert or assasinate world leader, gain a new resource, raise the controller's control level) of the adventure and the goal of the players is to stop the agenda of the gm,<br/>\n- gm has somewhat limited resources set by his conspiracy and there rules are for this<br/>\n- players are awarded for succumbing for weaknesses and uncovering new info on conspiracy which can probably lead the game in interesting directions<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are quite a lot of rules for a small book it is (hit location chart, modifiers in combat, many specific skills, etc.) and the mechanic is more or less mainstream besides the control and conspiracy thing which may be or not your cup of tea. Also, there's this conflict between refeering the game and playing the conspiracy and its leader. There could be similar troubles like in Burning Empires - setting apart these two roles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the game looks interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179554/#Comment_179554" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T14:40:26+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  2:40PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 2:40PM by chearns.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buddha the postman</cite>I bought the paper version.</blockquote>\nYeah, rules for hit locations and such will probably bore me beyond reason, but everything else you mention sounds really interesting.
