You don't need to make them roll. This move is already limited by whoever frames the scene (if you don't want the minion there, don't have the gang there). <br/>Alternative Name for this move: Perfect Attendance. <br/><br/>Did you reference the Velvet Underground in this skin? Take 1 forward. <br/><br/>I don't quite understand what is happening in Tribunus Plebis. The wording is difficult and I don't get what is happening in the fiction. I googled it and found the wiki on Tribunes, but I still couldn't quite make the leap. <br/><br/>You Rebel Scum is an awesome move, but could use a bit of trimming. You could reduce the options; "their numbers..." and "they'll believe any one thing..." would be the first against the wall if I lead the revolution. Also, reducing the 7-9 options would allow you to get rid of the miss text and fold the ideas in it back into the 7-9 area. <br/><br/>What if the Acolyte was a skin that didn't get a gang. What if you got to switch gangs as an advancement?<br/><br/>I'd trim the last backstory move, "someone thinks". <br/><br/>Love the darkest self. <br/><br/>I wish one of these moves let me be more like our leader. Oh wait, I can buy the Hollow's move to steal moves. Or crap, I can just buy the Queen's move and be just like her.

I guess I wouldn't want to take away what's cool about another character, you know? That doesn't mean i don't want to play it, though! I'd just make sure that at-the-table buy-in takes place.<br/><br/>The sex move feels more Dark than Volatile to me. Regarding that, can i switch which move in a different scene? Who picks which move from which character? <br/><br/>Really cool ideas, really cool execution of themes of conformity. My hat is off!<br/><br/>Love that idea behind Without Number (as you'll see when a couple of my Skins hit the ground &amp; are public, i've got similar inclinations) but i'm a little worried that the move won't trigger that often...? Inasmuch as players already have two ways to avoid complete death... but this is a much better price to pay, mechanically, so maybe it doesn't matter... But it's similar (more thematically rich for the acolyte, but less mechanically valuable) to the Ghoul's move Wait It Out or whatever it's called. <br/><br/>Anyway, fuck yeah. If you're done with it altogether, nice work. If you want to trim it up a little and playtest it a bit more, I think it'd got room to grow even better.<br/><br/>-Jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385904/#Comment_385904" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-27T18:07:51+00:00" title="July 27, 2012  6:07PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2012 6:08PM by Lula.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the help and enthusiasm, guys!

But it's only interesting if another PC is part of the gang- a lot of Acolyte moves have this problem- and that's not likely to happen by default. Just like the Mortal would be kind of flat with an NPC lover, the Acolyte will be flat with an NPC leader. I wonder if you could push picking a PC leader more, either in the backstory or in Playing the Acolyte?  I wouldn't want a player to pick this skin, have them not realize the dynamics at character creation, and spend a whole session orbiting a character no one else cares about. It also wasn't clear to me on reading if a PC leader needed to have a gang already (through being the Queen or spending an advance) or if by virtue of declaring them leader in my backstory I was giving them one.<br/><br/>It's kind of strange that you join another characters gang, but simultaneously there are several explicitly cultist-like bits. Like, if you're part of the Queen's clique, are they actually a cult? Or do you *also* belong to a cult? The cult things I'm thinking of: all the origins ("indoctrinated", "runs in the family", etc) and the talk of "faith" in the Darkest Self. Maybe it's "faith" that Regina George is your best friend and would never steer you wrong? If that's what you're going for it it's neat, but it could be clearer.<br/><br/>I like I'll Be Your Mirror, Omega, Seventh Sign, and Rebel Scum. I think I get Tribunus Plebis now, and it looks like it could be cool as long as the other PCs buy into it.<br/><br/>I don't like Without Number, not because it isn't interesting, but because doesn't mesh well with MH's themes. We're supposed to Give Everyone a Life, and that means even if they look like it from the outside, the Queen's flunkies aren't just carbon copies of each other with no distinguishing features. An official version of that D&amp;D cliche of replacing your dead character with a copy and going on like nothing changed would be really jarring for me as another player at the table. I'm supposed to care about Alex now because I cared about August before?<br/><br/>Also, if I were handed a pile of skins, it would stand out to me that the one and only Arabic name was on the cultist, right next to the one and only West African name. I assume you were just going for name diversity, but there's unfortunate implications there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385912/#Comment_385912" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-27T22:25:03+00:00" title="July 27, 2012 10:25PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2012 11:29PM by Benhimself.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One random idea: you can be a member of any PC's cult, and if they don't have a cult, they get one according to their advancement options, but you get a bit more control over it's nature than they do?

The backstory section could be the part of the skin where you make your... I mean the Leader's cult. You could give a player the gang advancement on their sheet, and then be like, "I'm this one". <br/>Maybe bribing the other players with that advancement is the key to the buy-in that Jackson is talking about. <br/><br/>Hmmm... does this mean you don't know about your cult until you get to the backstory discussion phase? Is that a problem?<br/><br/>By trimming the backstory move "someone thinks" I mean that I think there are too many backstory moves that deliver too many strings, and the fourth backstory move should throw itself on the grenade of conciseness. <br/><br/>I think I get Tribinus Plebis now. I found a good article on Novaroma. You're rewrite makes it clear what is happening. <br/><br/>I like the new True Believer. I'm glad that is +1/-2. Forget everything nice I said about Ben. <br/><br/>What I meant about folding the miss text in: I don't like it when moves arbitrate the miss in games fueled by the Apocalypse. When you miss, the MC gets to make a hard move. Don't take his hard move. Instead, put the Judas condition on the list. It might be awesome to pick it. (Also, here's a secret that you probably know... sometimes instead of coming up with something totally different to mess you up, MC's just pick things off the list when they make a hard move and will probably pick Judas). <br/><br/>Did I mention how much I like the Darkest Self text?<br/><br/>I am excited about Without Number. Here is my secret plan. Play an Acolyte in a game in a one-shot. Get everyone nice and cozy with the moves. Keep the Acolyte skin around. Make lots of copies and make sure they are in all of my friends stacks. <br/>One day, in a completely different game, play a different skin (like the Mortal since it's easy to advance). I'll take Without Number as my first advancement, blow my brains out, and become an Acolyte in their gang. Hilarious! Please make sure the move facilitates this plan that will take months to turn work out once. <br/><br/>If the Acolyte is widespread, it will revolutionize changing characters mid-campaign.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386155/#Comment_386155" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T13:38:58+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  1:38PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Diving back into editing now!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386161/#Comment_386161" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T15:03:09+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  3:03PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u2022 Regarding names, it seems I have a choice between Eurocentrism and negative associations, although I'm not convinced this skin has worse associations than, like, the Infernal and the Witch. Are there negative associations between Ghanaians and cults that I don't know about? I know a lot of Ghanaians are Christian, and I've definitely been including some Christian stuff in this skin, so that might be a thing. I included Ma\u1e25m\u016bd because it's a close variant on the world's most common given name, and also because it works as both a first name and a last name; but I added a line to the ending section about that just in case.<br/>\u2022 I imply cultish behavior on the Acolyte's part on purpose, although you can definitely make choices that are less or more cult-y, like emphasizing devotion over faith, or choosing the "desperate to belong" or "thinks it's a game" origins. It's quite possible that the Acolyte sees their group as a cult or a religion while everyone else is just like, dude chill, it's the cheerleading squad, not Opus Dei.

Now you either have a PC gang leader, or you pick a PC whom you want to replace the NPC gang leader. That way you can start to set up a power struggle, and start framing towards that PC eventually taking the gang advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386179/#Comment_386179" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T21:00:11+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  9:00PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's quite possible that the Acolyte sees their group as a cult or a religion while everyone else is just like, dude chill, it's the cheerleading squad, not Opus Dei. </blockquote>\nI am so doing this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386236/#Comment_386236" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T12:08:47+00:00" title="August  2, 2012 12:08PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\u2022 Regarding names, it seems I have a choice between Eurocentrism and negative associations</blockquote>\nI struggled with this, too. In the end, I think the best strategy is to list names from a variety of cultural/ethnic sources. The key is to pick those sources somewhat randomly, rather than asking yourself, "What cultures have creepy cults?" Don't typecast, instead sample from diverse sources.<br/><br/>I strove to pick symbolically meaningful names for each Skin. Once I'd picked out an ethnic or cultural group, I'd scan a names list (baby names lists work great) looking for one with a fitting meaning. I did this because it was on-genre (having rich symbolism in each name choice), though to be honest, sometimes I feared that it might be considered appropriative. Your mileage may vary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
