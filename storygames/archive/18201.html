No system, no rules, no character sheets, no dice. The first time was as a teenager; the players couldn't grasp the concept and it fell apart. The second time, in my twenties with two strangers, no less! (friends of a friend who went to bed). It was a success! I think at one point a coin came out to determine an event. We knew the tropes of the genre, we bought in to the premise of Characters having to do Something. It was actually a good "bonding" experience. <br/><br/>Have you ever heard of (or experienced!) a session in which the "Rule Book" was never consulted or the dice (cards/Ouji board) never consulted?

Regardless of the rules used, the next session was certain to involve their confrontation of the problems they'd unearthed. I mean, assuming they didn't suddenly decide to ignore it all and leave, but I guess that would also have been a continuation of the story.<br/><br/>So yeah, it totally could have gone forward with other rules. The "setting up" was a narrative setting up of conflicts, rather than anything mechanical. The reason those conflicts were nearly inevitable the next session was basically because they'd written themselves into a place where thing left to do was to jump into the conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410803/#Comment_410803" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T22:04:27+00:00" title="March 29, 2013 10:04PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2013 10:06PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last year, I was hanging out with two friends who'd played Pathfinder, and we started talking about Pathfinder, and one of their friends showed up and said, "What's that?"<br/><br/>"A roleplaying game."<br/><br/>"What's a roleplaying game?"<br/><br/>So I responded, "You wake up in a strange, ancient-looking room.

The new guy was poking around the room when one of my friends starting announcing fictional actions too.  (Me: "Oh, I guess you're also there!")  The third guy waited for a bit and then described a creepy doll crawling out of the new guy's backpack.  He then proceeded to play the doll, with various "extend and reconfigure self" powers, while the other two players more or less played their real-world selves (except for, y'know, not freaking out about being stuck in a magic room).<br/><br/>I would totally do this on a regular basis.  We don't <i>need</i> formal systems to determine what could/should happen, we just need a small set of techniques to structure the conversation and keep everyone on the same page.  <br/><br/>My biggest challenge as GM was acting as the enforcer of fictional time, and telling the fast-talking player to shut up for a sec so we could learn what the other players' characters were up to.  (Not that this issue is unique to rulesless play!)  As long as we maintained everyone's ability to play all their characters acting simultaneously, the whole thing went smoothly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410811/#Comment_410811" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T01:40:46+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  1:40AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll clarify my own reasoning for not wanting to do it on a regular basis. I think I could pull it off, but my players enjoy having the rules there to give them a structure to fall back on when they don't know what to do. On my side of the game, I like having a system there to introduce complications and situations I wouldn't normally have considered. In particular, the Fiasco setup comes to mind as helping to generate great ideas and situations that I probably wouldn't get from just our own imaginations.<br/>Apocalypse World resolution also does this for me, since even when you don't get what you want, interesting and DIFFERENT things happen, things that change the story in ways I wasn't expecting beforehand. You can get surprise out of freeform from the other players, but rules can provide things that were unpredictable to everyone.<br/><br/>So for me having the rules is a way to enhance the experience I might have during freeform, while at the same time providing a safety net to fall back on when we're directionless or when there's disagreement between players over what should happen.<br/><br/>However, at the same time, the occasional session without it can be very interesting because it gives the group a greater level of control over the interesting things we want to see happen. Plus, there's no structure the group needs to understand or have explained, which makes it easy for new folks.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410814/#Comment_410814" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T02:46:13+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  2:46AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of things I like about Archipelago is that it's <i>almost</i> systemless; it's really just a framework for systemless play (admittedly the That Might Not Be So Easy call adds a random factor, but you can do away with that).

Somewhere on the interwebs they have a pretty nice text well worth searching out.<br/><br/>There are a number of problems talking abut this kind of thing though.<br/><br/>1) There actually are a whole bunch of rules to this stuff<br/>If you played anthropologist and watched people involved in this sort of play, and could put aside what you already know, you'd pretty quickly be able to suss out the rules involved. We generally tend not to write this stuff out, or we gloss over it, or we write it up in a way different from the "proper" bits of the rules. Some of it just seems way too obvious to bother writing down. Some of it probably is, but it could be worthwhile to do an experiment writing out the instructions clearly and briefly.<br/><br/>If you ever had a grade-school teacher who made you do the "Write Instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich" exercise as a kid, you'll know what I mean by this. (Hint: It's a lot harder than you think it would be, as the teacher in the exercise will basically play the part of a completely uninitiated reader of the instructions).<br/><br/>2) Hobby gamers have a fairly different idea of what a game must be to be a game than lots of other folks<br/>The vast, vast majority of games in this world are extremely simple. OTOH, most also have some kind of clear goals which at minimum act as an "off-switch" to the activity.<br/><br/>3) At some very basic level, we all know this stuff is Play Pretend.<br/>We need to be able to find a way to convey that, along with the idea that Play Pretend itself is fun, worthwhile, and perfectly acceptable as an activity for adults. Mechanics do lots of positive things, but one of the things they do is act as a shield to criticism that this stuff is really an activity for children only. That attitude is bunk, but I really do think sometimes there is an attitude of "Baffle those critics with bullshit" in the love for complex mechanics.<br/><br/>4) Social recognition by turning stuff into a for-sale commodity<br/>One of the great successes that came out of The Forge days was a whole lot of info about becoming an independent small game maker and seller in a reasonable and do-able fashion. Awesome! I think there was a downside though: It really cemented the idea that not much was worthwhile, unless you could turn it into a commodity, and that doesn't fit well with this type of gaming.<br/><br/>5)Factions: <i>System Matters!</i> vs. <i>All this stuff is a bunch of optional tools!</i>, and everyone in between.<br/>As noted in point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, there actually is always a system in place, even if we don't recognize it. Having said that, the type of gaming we're looking at in this thread tends to fall closer to the second attitude up there in italics. In fact, most of the tools are so very optional, that you could play successfully without them. <br/><br/>The classic "We played all night and never opened a rule book or threw any dice!" line is a nod to exactly that.

I was thinking about the other side of the coin in regards to # 2 "different idea of what a game must be ". Even non-gamers have an idea of how stories go: heroes, villains, conflicts, twists and turns. We've all seen movies and (hopefully) read books. This commonality helps to make a shared story. I think I'm talking about social contract and buy-in. Here's the Genre, Setting, Theme, etc; now, let's play with the tropes. <br/><br/>At what point do we separate Play Style from Rules? I can think of three instances where I was involved in a game where another player couldn't "get into" the style of play, even though the Rules were agreed on. None of them ended in acrimony, I'm glad to say. I think the worst comment was "Thanks but I don't think this is for me" (can you tell we're Canadian, eh?).<br/><br/>I think the point I'm fumbling with is really just the basis for my own brand of Social Contract which goes " We are going to gather together, as a group, and enjoy this game". If we can agree on that, then everything else should come together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410834/#Comment_410834" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T07:40:55+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  7:40AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2013 7:48AM by Rickard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...but my players enjoy having the rules there to give them a structure to fall back on when they don't know what to do.</blockquote>\nRules are structures but freeform uses structures as well. It's not 100 % improv in freeform. Even if you think you're doing it, it's still implicit structures that you implement, like story structures or conversation structures. I believe that when everybody using the same known structures, it's a bigger probability of creating a great game session. Otherwise, it would be the equivalent to one player using the d20 system and another the Storytelling system without telling each other.\n<blockquote>So for me having the rules is a way to enhance the experience I might have during freeform, while at the same time providing a safety net to fall back on when we're directionless or when there's disagreement between players over what should happen.</blockquote>\nThat said, I do agree with this although there are structures out there that does this without being in form of game mechanics.<br/><br/>More information:<br/><a href="http://playwithintent.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Play With Intent</a> (here's <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/playWithIntent_newLayout.pdf" rel="nofollow">a pdf</a> with layout done by me)<br/><br/><a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">Jeepform</a> - Vi \xe5ker Jeep                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410957/#Comment_410957" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-01T07:25:47+00:00" title="April  1, 2013  7:25AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2013 6:47PM by Evan_Torner.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Germany, they call this an "<i>Erz\xe4hlspiel</i>."

For instance, did a player ever say something which led you (or someone else) to say, "Hang on, that's not how this works. If you want to find out what's behind the door, you've got to open it, and then I'll tell you what's there"? Or was it all, "Cool, this just turned into a game where we're all making up the contents of the rooms and trying to see whose idea is more interesting.

The invitation was to friends already hanging out/gather for game playing of various sorts: "let's do free form roleplaying".  We had a GM, and it was really just a more pure form of some of the play we engaged in, but without the rules of D&amp;D to obscure GM fiat (e.g. turning a 20 on a to hit roll to bash down a door, into you getting your sword stuck in the door).  In that way it was much more functional and saved time (especially in character creation), while allowing much more flexibility.  I remember playing a lizardman who could run on walls.<br/><br/>More recently, I GM'd a couple asynchronous games with friends online.  There I just launched into it directly, invitation was play.  Maybe because I was GM'ing, but here I felt that there was a lot more exploring what the rules were.  I was occasionally uncomfortable having so system to tell me when to make hard moves, and there was occasionally a player asking if what he introduced was ok (narrating the existence of things beyond what his character was doing).  My tendency was to always allow everything and incorporate it.\n<blockquote><br/>5)Factions: <i>System Matters!</i> vs. <i>All this stuff is a bunch of optional tools!</i>, and everyone in between.<br/>As noted in point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, there actually is always a system in place, even if we don't recognize it. Having said that, the type of gaming we're looking at in this thread tends to fall closer to the second attitude up there in italics. In fact, most of the tools are so very optional, that you could play successfully without them. </blockquote>\nHow is "system matters" a faction?

We'd already gone way beyond the rules, since the book had no rules for pretending to fly Airwolf, and giving up the dice seemed like a reasonable sacrifice to avoid 45 minutes of tedium. That particular line of continuity ended up permanently in that ad-hoc format, because we couldn't think of a game system for it back in 1985. It did eventually get gheto-ized into a school lunch thing, though, because we also liked some other games whose written procedures of play worked for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411016/#Comment_411016" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-01T17:35:44+00:00" title="April  1, 2013  5:35PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An interesting discussion.

It seems like this problem can easily come up in a freeform game as well.  Whereas something like microscope, which I've played several times and always enjoyed, I've never had this problem with - probably because the rules so clearly govern who can say what when.

I had a quick read-through of Play With Intent and will have a longer look when I can "absorb" it at leisure. It's interesting that your "part in it was definitely inspired by the free play I did over the years".  Also, "Having structures in place really helps play keep going though". Specifically, I am now wondering if I (or someone else) could distill these structures down to a simple method of telling a good camp-fire ghost story collectively.<br/><br/>"Yeah, I know a ghost story but you have to help out. We just have to follow five simple guidelines..." Now, THAT would be a Story Game!<br/><br/>I was reading JEEPform but when I got to the part about the Rapist holding eye contact with the Victim - well, let's just say that I immediately thought of Lamentations of the Flame Princess for some reason. Must be something in the Nordic water. Makes me wonder if Vikings were the original LARPers ; )<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/timonkey">@timonkey</a>. This is why I find Actual Play more engaging than theory. "a lizardman who could run on walls." Very cool. I don't know the current state of affairs but back in my day "official" lizardmen couldn't do that. But why not? We've seen little lizards do it; by extrapolation, why not big lizards (giant spiders, Attack of the Giant Ants - "An ant that big would collapse under its own body weight!" "Sit down, shut up and enjoy the movie!" ); but we have no problem with the fact that he's, you know, a LIZARDMAN, for crying out loud! Don't crawl your "pedantic" over my flying "awesome"! Fine, but he can only RUN on walls or cling motionless. Yeah, I could see that. Story trumps Game.<br/><br/>I also thought it interesting that your first example mentions D+D, a d20, and a lizardman (how many old grognards have gaming "war stories" that use those very same words). But your second example uses "make hard moves" and "narrating the existence of things beyond what his character was doing". A definite change of influence to your freeform approach. Or was it? I wonder: if there was a Paladin in your first example, could her player introduce a Squire? You see, in D+D a squire adds a tactical advantage; he's a tool, essentially a +2 sword. But in a Story, a Squire might be a liability - a pain in the ass. Hell, the Squire might be more interesting than the Paladin and BECOME the player-character. I mean, if a Lizardman can run on walls...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411055/#Comment_411055" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-02T02:28:59+00:00" title="April  2, 2013  2:28AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2013 2:29AM by TotallyGuy.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I spoke to my youngest brother the other day and he was suggesting running a game for his friends where they're in a zombie apocalypse frontiersman scenario.

But your second example uses "make hard moves" and "narrating the existence of things beyond what his character was doing". A definite change of influence to your freeform approach. Or was it? I wonder: if there was a Paladin in your first example, could her player introduce a Squire? You see, in D+D a squire adds a tactical advantage; he's a tool, essentially a +2 sword. But in a Story, a Squire might be a liability - a pain in the ass. Hell, the Squire might be more interesting than the Paladin and BECOME the player-character. I mean, if a Lizardman can run on walls...<br/></blockquote>\nThere was definitely a change of influence (although "hard moves" was not among them in my second example, that's me of now looking back).  I do think that a Paladin could probably introduce a squire in the first example, as with anything plausible and inside the scope of the character.  If we were pretending to play D&amp;D, it probably wouldn't be cool, as it would come with mechanical bonuses, but freeform didn't offer us that so more was fair game.  How impromptu this play was also may have been a factor; without an adventure planned, the GM is naturally more receptive to input.  At start of play, my character consisted of "I am a lizardman" (I probably had a name too).  I believe the running on walls bit came about because I was in a corridor trying to get past some guards, and I'm like: I'm a lizard, I run on walls!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411070/#Comment_411070" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-02T07:05:10+00:00" title="April  2, 2013  7:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had to run systemless games many times, because existing systems just put too much weight on things that either didn't interest me or which I preferred to dictate myself.

This type of play is vastly more free in form than other, related games which are more familiar, but the suggestion that they are without rules is a red herring.<br/><br/>Most of the rules are not written out, and that's a bit problematic, for many of the same reason's you have talked about in other threads. <br/><br/>For purposes of functional play, the most important rules may well be simply assumed to be understood, and that can be a very poor assumption when it comes to transferring the concepts to someone not in direct face-to-face contact.<br/><br/>A practical example of this:<br/><br/>I was messaging with vulpinoid, trying to get some insight into setting up a kind of miniatures using/LARPish hybrid type thing, similar to what is known in Australia as a <i>multi-form</i> which is out towards/in freeform territory. He has a great deal of experience with that, as a player and designer.<br/><br/>I wanted to know how, as a designer/ref/helper one prevented PC A from simply going and killing PC B, especially since the set up for the scenario certainly indicated violence was a viable solution (and there might be some mechanism for that). Back and forth messaging occurred until he told me the most important part:<br/><br/><i>In Australian freeforms/multiforms of this sort, it's simply considered extremely bad form to go and kill off someone else's character straight away, even in a fictional set up with deadly rivalries and capacity for violence. Everyone else had also paid to participate. It was something understood socially by the players that if some kind of terminal violence was going to occur between characters, it didn't happen until well into the game, and then usually only near the end of the time slot.</i><br/><br/><b>That is an incredibly important rule.</b><br/><br/>Unwritten, understood if you're part of the play culture or you encounter it face to face, amazingly non-obvious to me initially. Also a rule that is vastly more important than any later additions of fiddly nonsense about miniature positioning or dice rolling and whatnot.<br/><br/>To me, that's a really good example of the sort of unwritten mechanics that are way more important to play than all of the stuff we tend to traditionally think of as important. We tend, I feel, to focus on writing rules that are two or three categories down the scale of importance in proper, non-freeform games.<br/><br/>I do think there is an entire realm of development worth is exploring in writing down those higher level, more important rules and even an entire unexplored/poorly explored path in the presentation of those higher level rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411282/#Comment_411282" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-04T07:20:53+00:00" title="April  4, 2013  7:20AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2013 7:23AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To me, that's a really good example of the sort of unwritten mechanics that are way more important to play than all of the stuff we tend to traditionally think of as important.

"Hey guys, let's make sure we give everyone a chance to talk," etc.  If you can write a system for turning an average conversation into a spectacular one, you've mastered freeform design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411358/#Comment_411358" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T06:01:59+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  6:01AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David:<br/><br/>That's kinda where I'm going with that stuff.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of threads at RPGnet where people are trying to get a handle on really old school style D&amp;D play, people who didn't start playing back in Ye Olden Dayse. There inevitably seems to be a ton of confusion.<br/><br/>Part of it seems to come from the fact that no one wants to just say: Actually, D&amp;D was nothing but a form of freeform. That's the core of the whole thing. All of this other stuff is a narrowing down and a focusing tool, or a set of basically commonly used but optional tools that exist for [reason X for given tool Y].<br/><br/>I do think you could write up tools/techniques for good conversation, for good freeform. Matthjis and Emily are already taking a stab at some of that. One can recombine or limit those tools. Archipelago is almost the classic example of that in action.<br/><br/>My own interest these days is in presentation. What is the best way to convey that stuff that makes everything work?<br/><br/>The best-best way seems to be what you suggest in your last line: An aware player takes the lead, by example by preference or by calling a quick timeout, mentioning a better technique, and acting as teacher/leader that way, in a face to face interaction with their own local group.<br/><br/>What are the next-best ways? Printable posters that we put up until we don't need to put them up anymore? A list of techniques geared to whatever game is being played? Pre-game conversation checklists? A small fold up list of techniques that can go in a pocket? A simple video on Youtube demonstrating the idea/technique?

But that's what some gamers do I guess - they start to emulate the authority they know, which is to say they attempt to emulate their dad (or mum). Which really only works in the context of a parent/child relationship.<br/><br/>But I guess maybe it'll seem you can fail to communicate something to a peer, then treat them as being in poor form for not forfilling it latter on and such a state could be called a rule.

They're a tool, written out and made official, that cover tons of useful behavioral ground quickly. They also cover lots of ground that in other games is never truly put in the spotlight but is terribly important to functional play.<br/><br/>Having said that, they still exist within a body of text, and that's where I start  to ask questions about presentation options/tools.<br/><br/>In my own experience, most RPGs are transmitted orally with only one player actually reading the text and then explaining to the other players. Often, that player has actually first had the mechanics/structures/tools explained to them orally ( usually through play themselves) and may only have a spotty, at best, understanding of those things.<br/><br/>I have no scientific evidence to back this, no numbers to name, but my own best guess is that the bulk of people playing RPGs are effectively playing some kind of structured freeform anyway.<br/><br/>Certainly accounts by Mike Mornard (Old Geezer) talking about playing early D&amp;D with the designers with no access to written rules sounds to me like structured freeform as the core activity. I'm willing to bet that many people who have played over the years have experienced much the same kind of play. <br/><br/>For them, RPGs really are a sort of stylized play pretend verbal game that they learn through practice and have only the vaguest understanding of the intricacies of the written text beyond color and setting (common among the White Wolf  Classic World of Darkness games I participated in years back).<br/><br/>If this is common and if this is fun, then maybe it would be more useful to look at those kinds of play and see what is going on. Figure out what structures/mechanics make that sort of play work, and really understand what the most minimal and easiest to describe structures are in actuality.<br/><br/>Getting a handle on that could very much up-end how texts are written, how they're presented, and change what we think of as valuable even on the consumer end of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411489/#Comment_411489" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-06T22:04:49+00:00" title="April  6, 2013 10:04PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I have mixed feelings about rewards.

The structures seem to be:<br/><br/>The GM is the judge of what contributions are valuable.  The GM's basis for this is not spelled out as explicit rules, but is consistent enough that anyone who plays with him for a while gets a good sense of it.<br/><br/>The GM provides the setting, and the players' goal is to traverse that setting and make valuable contributions.<br/><br/>When a player attempts to contribute:<br/><br/>- If the contribution is not deemed valuable, the GM will look annoyed, ask for a d20 roll, and only grant success if the player rolls a 20.<br/><br/>- If the contribution is deemed valuable, the GM will express approval, interact with the player for a bit, ask for a d20 roll, and grant success on a difficulty number that seems appropriate to the fictional task and conducive to fun results.  The interaction will then continue, elaborating on the results of the attempted task.<br/><br/>There are lists of things you roll for, and the player characters have stats in those things.  These represent the characters' fictional abilities.  The GM will factor these fictional abilities into the difficulty number, though less so than the roleplay.<br/><br/>When rolling the d20, a 1 is always a problematic failure, a 20 is always a useful success, and a 10 always gets you an experience point to boost a stat.<br/><br/>That's the structure and mechanics.  The rest of the game is "the GM's basis for judging contributions", which is all colorful portrayal, clever problem-solving, and riffing off Tolkein.  If you can do all three at once, the GM will love you, and the other players who've bought into the GM's taste will love you.  You and your contributions will receive attention and enthusiastic response, and that's the game's primary reward.<br/><br/>Many will find this social set-up a huge turn-off, but it's one example of a system that's pretty freeform and pretty stable (been running for years, and Jay seems to have standards and enjoys it).<br/><br/>I, uh, don't have any brilliant takeaways from this, but hopefully someone else will...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411494/#Comment_411494" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-07T04:00:33+00:00" title="April  7, 2013  4:00AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2013 4:01AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's interesting in the above is that the GM is a part of the game system.

What does that mean? What are examples of that? What are reactions to it like?<br/><br/>Once we've got some examples and their impact, we start to see a pattern developing.<br/><br/>We can write things related to the pattern.<br/><br/>Then we can take that part, and consider presentation possibilities.<br/><br/><b>" Interpersonal stuff like what Emily mentions is already influencing play; is there any way to make that dynamic quicker and easier to learn, or more reinforcing? "</b><br/><br/>I have considered this question as well. So far, the only method/mechanic/tool I've come up with was a little orphaned thing for one of my own never-completed-picked-up-now-and-then projects. They were a series of cards asking questions about play, that were couched in language implying that game just played had been a movie. All of the questions were open-ended, and were sideways attempts to make it easier for the players to talk about what they had or had not liked during the gameplay, and even what they like in gameplay and player contributions generally.<br/><br/>The idea here was to simply make post-game chatting about play an official part of play, and encourage group dialogue. Picking a cad and answering the question on it ( possibly with a tiny bit of on the spot fiction created to go with it) was meant to help the group learn what each member considered important, and also generate ideas for future sessions of game-play.<br/><br/>There was no mechanical reward at all. Any positives were simply in helping the group gel in future play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411497/#Comment_411497" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-07T07:11:20+00:00" title="April  7, 2013  7:11AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... this thread is becoming very interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411512/#Comment_411512" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-07T15:50:51+00:00" title="April  7, 2013  3:50PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently came across this article, The Tyranny of Structurelessness, by Jo Freeman: <a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm</a>.

I like structures, because I don't need to think what is socially acceptable: the group has agreed upon that when deciding to use the system. Even the all-powered GM model is a good structure in this sense: it shows explicitly, who has the power and the responsibility, and it makes explicit who is calling the shots and who isn't - and makes it possible to turn the tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411540/#Comment_411540" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T06:39:51+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  6:39AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The article was fairly interesting on a quick skim through. Straight off it begins to talk about how structures inherently develop pretty much organically.<br/><br/>So part of my interest here is identifying those functioning structures.<br/><br/>The next part that is interesting to me is identifying which groups and under what circumstances those structures are useful. <br/><br/>Included in circumstances would be: <br/>group size<br/>composition<br/>changes to size and composition over time<br/>frequency of play<br/>return to play in setting or lack of same<br/>physical play space and physical artifacts<br/><br/>Just considering some of those factors, it starts to be clearer why certain sets of circumstances favor a (more comparatively) freeform approach or at least open up the way to it ( and likewise, identify circumstances where more formal games work better or have the way opened up for them to be successful).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411542/#Comment_411542" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T06:46:46+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  6:46AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another take on this is to bring up all the failed sessions that everybody had with games that are structured freeform and analyse what got wrong.

the fail-states as well.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in the differences between successful longer term freeform play versus successful short term freeform play.<br/><br/>I suspect that while there are commonalities, the differences will be fascinating to examine as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment"

And more importantly, try out the new thesis and see if that solves the problem. Just like I did in the Limited Creative Space thread. The problem that I can see with only looking at the successful sessions is that you can't really pin point what kind of things (not thing) that creates the successful ones. There are a lot of structures/conventions that people don't think about. I've noticed this from my own games, where other GMs playtested the game with me as a player. Techniques that I took for granted and used without thinking of it was missing in other game masters' game styles, which forced me to construct structures around it (because I've also noticed that "GM tips" usually are ignored).<br/><br/>[edit] I've been talking about this ... phenomena earlier in this thread. Using non-mechanical rewards without realizing it or thinking they are freely <i>successfully</i> improvising when they actually are following a structure or using techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411549/#Comment_411549" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T07:34:50+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  7:34AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, yes, I do understand better what you're getting at, Rickard.<br/><br/>For example, I recently had a bit of enlightenment where it came to creating short term/one off games that were heavy on mimicking fun/Right to Dream fun.<br/><br/>Basically, it was a guideline formula that said supporting that kind of thing and making it memorable worked well when it was:<br/>80% known clich\xe9s/stereotypes/genre tropes<br/>10% twists of the above<br/>10% novel bits or bits stolen from another family of genre tropes/clich\xe9s/stereotypes<br/><br/>So, if I wanted to write up something that I could pass along to another person, I'd want to somehow identify supporting techniques that I regularly use, but am blind to because I've absorbed them and just trot them out as standard operating procedures.
