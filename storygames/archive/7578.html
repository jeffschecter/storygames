I know a lot of people dislike rolling 3d6 down the row of your stats in D&amp;D, but man I always thought it was great. I love seeing what a random system spits out and making sense of it.<br/><br/>So last night we make characters for Houses of the Blooded and I sit down with this vague character concept of a cross between Peter Steele and a sort of proto-Buddha - depressed, angsty, self-destructive, but also wise and compassionate and forsaking material possessions and whatnot. Then we randomly roll parents families and I have to interpret that. Father's a loremaster and trader in secrets, mother's a crazy warrior (and the more dominant one). I'm totally seeing parental expectations and disappointment. Randomly roll birth order. Firstborn? Oof. Okay, this is really making sense. I roll a younger brother - totally set up to be the ambitious antagonist and usurper of the firstborn, and might even have the mother's blessing to do so.<br/><br/>And the thing is anything I rolled could make sense. Sometimes it's not apparent at first but all it takes is some creative mental gymnastics and the results are usually cool. My character could just as easily been the youngest of six and he would be angsty because he was ignored and he would have forsaken material gain because nothing was expected of him.<br/><br/>Doing that, taking random input and spitting out fiction, is pretty much a distillation of why I love gaming so having that in chargen is just another part of play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168171/#Comment_168171" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T06:10:27+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  6:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I couldn't agree more, Bret.  Back in the day, coming up with a way to make the character you rolled - whether it be stats, superpowers, mutant animal or whatever - into a viable and worthwhile PC <i>was</i> part of play.<br/><br/>Games like D&amp;D were especially fun in this regard, where a certain 'party balance' is desirable and you have to either stuff new characters into roles to which they aren't well suited OR develop tactics that will keep your group of 4 fighters and a bard alive.  Somehow.  The GM also derived fun from this by having to create challenges for unusual sets of PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168174/#Comment_168174" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T06:32:44+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  6:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In two weeks my group is starting a bi-weekly Traveler game set in the Flash Gordon universe.  While I personally think Spirit of the Century is a much better choice for Flash Gordon, nonetheless I'm very excited for the character generation session. I've deliberately not thought of what kind of character I want to play and just let the rolls fall where they may. Some of my friends find this idea abhorrent, but I definitely think it has it's place. I wouldn't want EVERY game to have a chargen process like Traveler's, but it's definitely a fun diversion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168177/#Comment_168177" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T06:55:56+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  6:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have little to add other than, I couldn't agree more with the sentiments here _and_ it is interesting to see this idea of random char gen getting a broad resurgance.

Backgrounds and story-level info is great in this sense. <br/><br/>If it's something like D&amp;D, though, then there had better be some reason why the character with really high stats can play alongside the guy with really wimpy stats, and they can both have fun.<br/><br/>I really liked how Ryan's unnamed game had you roll random stats but then gave you a higher level or more abilities if you rolled poorly. <br/><br/>Even better if the chargen process is a bit of a gamble. In my Fudgeified version of Red Box Hack, you have some risky choices to make in chargen ("Am I willing to risk a really low score in another ability to get an exceptionally high score in this ability NOW?").<br/><br/>Those types of "checks and balances" make it more fun for me. For instance, imagine something like PTA, but with some kind of character effectiveness stats added in. In that game, maybe rolling higher stats would mean you have a lower Screen Presence...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168218/#Comment_168218" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T08:32:12+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  8:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2008 8:33AM by Marhault.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>A random character gen system which can kill the character before the game begins is, frankly, just a stupid gimmick--a waste of my limited gaming time.</blockquote>\nI completely agree.

Technically "roll or choice", but if you go by your rolls, literally the only thing you decide about your character is her (his) name. Everything from abilities, quirks, speical abilities, weapons, traumas, affects, and the reasons for becoming a maid are all generated randomly.<br/><br/>Normally, I hate this. For some reason, with Maid I love this. I think it's because you're not tied to this character for a year: You'll play 1-3 sessions with this one character and move on.<br/><br/>HELLAS: You decide all the numeric stuff yourself: Stats, skills, and the story stuff like "Your Goal", "Your Personality/Relationship Drawbacks", etc. Thing is, you decide stuff like family relationships, events that happened in the job paths you've chosen, etc by random rolls. <br/>This... this was awesome. I had a vague concept of my character "A Nephelai (pale dude with wings) Ambassador-Type!", but nothing about his personality or history. Based on a few random rolls, I weaved this whole mini-backstory about losing a good friend in battle, and inheriting his blade.

Talsorian-style Lifepath systems OTOH, are great, as people have noted above. Basically, if a game is going to have random characters I want it to be neat stuff I can run with. Or if it's a low-commitment game where it quickly produces an interesting character (again, Maid RPG, and to a lesser extent TFOS). Otherwise I'll come to the game with a character concept in mind, and build based on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168336/#Comment_168336" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T12:55:51+00:00" title="September 10, 2008 12:55PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reign's another great example, with the roll giving you both your abilities (all characters end up being made of the same number of points, but where they are spent depends on the roll).

It stikes me as very germane to the discussion at hand.\n<blockquote><cite>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Erick Wujcik</cite><br/>RANDOM CHARACTER GENERATION: A Rationalization<br/>Some readers will be surprised to discover that there is a "point system" for creating the animal characters in this book.  There is a good reason for it; we want to make sure that every player could create an animal character to suit themselves.  Which, if you think about it, is really not all that different from the way things are handled in <em>Heroes Unlimited</em>.  After all, Bionic and Robotic characters also build themselves.  But this game, just like <em>Heroes Unlimited</em> (and most other Palladium games), is based on random character generation.<br/>There's a fair amount of controversy in the roleplaying game community about character generation.  Chiefly, some players complain that it is not as much fun or as challenging to roll up characters off a table as it is to 'create' the characters.<br/>There is some validity to the argument.  Regardless of our personal opinions on the subject you are free to do what you will with the game.  If you are a game master, then simply let the players create their characters according to your own preferences.  If you are a player, then lobby your game master for whatever changes you feel will make for the most playable game.  However, here are a few good reasons to retain the random character generation system:<br/>1. Excellent players can role-play ANYTHING; granted, the play testers that I and the other folks of Palladium have at their disposal are superb.  An excellent player can play any character, and sees a weak character as a challenge, not a liability.<br/>When running my own campaigns, I frequently deprive characters of all their various powers and possessions.  It is when the character is in the direst of straits that fantastic role-playing comes out.<br/>Let's look at one example.  Recently a pair of players in fantasy game were captured by enemies.  They managed to escape, but they found themselves lost in a strange desert with nothing but a piece of wire.  The roleplaying went on for several weeks, alternating between the lost survivors dodging armoured hunters and straining to get water, shelter and food in hostile land.  It was an intensely interesting role-playing adventure.<br/>2. Another advantage of random character generation is in the convenience that it provides to the game master.  Instead of laboriously 'constructing' every new villain and N.P.C., the game master can just 'roll-up the new encounters.  This makes scenario design and quick response to player actions much easier.<br/>3. Finally, let's not forget that random rolls reflect real life.  Even in the 'perfect' lives of fantasy characters there is no control over their origins.  Super characters are usually created by accident or by forces over which the character has little or no control.</blockquote>\nCopied exactly, including all the dropped articles, british spelling, and american grammar. =P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168674/#Comment_168674" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T11:19:11+00:00" title="September 12, 2008 11:19AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2008 11:26AM by David Artman.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks... and, wow, it reads weird to my 2008 eyes.<br/><br/>1) 'If you're GOOD ENOUGH, you can handle being the gimp next to the champ.' Nice. On the one hand, he's got a point (and, generally, he puts responsibiliity for our happiness in our own hands). On the other hand, it sounds snobbish--if I'm unhappy being gimpy, it MUST be because *I* suck as a role player, not because I am edged out of the reward cycle. On the gripping hand... that's from, what, 1985 or something? To even present that much seems rather "experimental" or "modish"--don't we talk all the time about how everyone's responsible for the fun at the table?<br/><br/>2) Ah... so an incoherent mish-mash of a character is fine (never mind story, or tuning a challenge, or providing necessary hooks or tone) so long as it saves the GM a few minutes? .... Yeah, I can't find anything redeeming about this, unless one is trying to emulate roguelike gameplay and just do a hack-and-crawl to level-grind.<br/><br/>3) OK, I'll buy that... to an extent. If the game is about competitive, gamist challenges, then it can only randomize color, not efficacy (word, Alan!). If the game is about dealing with being underprivileged or overprivileged (real hippie nar shit) then random efficacy could really add something. Not really being sure whether TMNT is the former or the latter--or abashed--I can't say if this point is shit or applebutter. Each game will be different, on this front (as will each gamer, and their notion of why play and what's fun). .... Yep, just WAY to generalized to be accepted at face value.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a very interesting blast from the past!

We played the hell out of both.<br/><br/>Tho, thinking back, I remember that the long-running V&amp;V game needed some GM love to solve the Caesar Slaad problem of widely varying competency levels.  Over the course of the campagin, we had several power adjustments unilaterally dictated by the GM.  In addition to keeping our power level uniform, this gave the game a real comic book series feeling, as our characters uncontrollably evolved through different power versions.

I like how Kenzer Co. handles the old 3d6 down the line in Hackmaster and Aces &amp; Eights. Sure you randomly roll your stats, but then you spend points raising and lowering them, all the while gambling on randomly rolling for (hopefully not) character crippling drawbacks to get more points for skills and stats.

I always loved this, because it was both random and yet still required you to choose how you were going to interpret the data.<br/><br/>So as an example, you could get the words "doubt", "heart", and "training". (This is, in fact, the example from the book.) Right off the top of my head, that suggests to me a person who was initiated into a secret cult at a young age, sent to Al Amarja to commit ritual assassinations for the cult that require him to consume the hearts of his enemies. However, some event that occurred in his past has left him unsure of the rightness of the cult's cause, and he isn't sure if he should complete the killings or try to escape the cult's influence.<br/><br/>It also suggests to me an ex-champion martial artist who fights underground after being falsely accused of doping up in the ring. He wants to prove his worthiness as a fighter to scores of doubters, and he's heard that the people who set him up regularly do business deals on Al Amarja, and that the fighting circuit there is particularly profitable and brutal... all the better to test his skills and perhaps attain revenge...<br/><br/>Three words, scores of possible characters.

Yeah, I can't find anything redeeming about this, unless one is trying to emulate roguelike gameplay and just do a hack-and-crawl to level-grind.</blockquote>\nYes, and looking at the adventures in the back of the book, the adventure designers didn't use random generation at all (and, in fact, the BIO-E costs don't add up \u2014 the designers gave their NPCs more power than PCs get).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_Frund" title="Nathan_Frund"><img alt="Nathan_Frund" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://api.ning.com/files/Mo4fAo*KKV3pXq-p6o6m32GANbWqGRLiv5FusqWrp-k_/8485279.bin?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;crop=1%3A1"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_Frund">Nathan_Frund</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168950/#Comment_168950" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T08:11:01+00:00" title="September 14, 2008  8:11AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like random character generation from stem to stern.  Often the result is a mould breaker for you.  Even if you tweak the randomly created character at the end it still gets people thinking differently which if very often a good thing.<br/><br/>Part of this feeling comes from the weariness of point buy systems.  The weariness comes from having to buy bits from a menu and hoping that I didn't overlook something crucial.  I've found that once I've become familiar with a game using point buy to the point that I know what's crucial, all future characters at the core look the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
