That's a good solution if the <i>entire</i> campaign is going to be for two, but it doesn't handle drop in drop out as well as the following does:<br/><br/><small>So this is the scaling idea that my players rejected. So fwiw it might be a bad idea.<br/>Thanks to Scarlet Heroes that prompted me to think of the idea of changing the rules rather than changing the modules. But my solution is very different from theirs.</small><br/><br/>The idea is that for each player you are short a nice party of four, you add one shadow. This is perfect for when you have two players, then they have a shadow each.<br/><br/>For each shadow a PC has, it means:<br/><br/><b>You get an extra full turn per round.</b> If you're using rolled initiative, roll an extra dice. If you do "tapping" inititative, you get an extra card. Etc.<br/><br/><b>You get an extra pool of HP.</b> Whenever you take damage or are healed, you choose which pool gets hurt or healed. Each pool has its own death saves. One pool might be 0 &amp; dying for example and then it gets a healing word and the death saves for that pool is cleared.<br/>You have one of the pools and your shadow has one of the pools. So you'll say "I take that damage on my shadow" or "I'll take that damage myself". And for things that can group heal, or group hand out temp HP, the shadow can be one of the targets and you can be another. If either pool dies, does not matter which, you lose a shadow and you get the remaining pool. If either pool is unconscious, you only get one turn per round (hello death spiral) since you don't have a shadow.<br/><br/>The turns per rounds is still you. You get grappled, then you are grappled. Your shadow isn't running around separately from you. The shadow isn't an extra character. The shadow is only making you faster (more turns) &amp; more durable (more HP). Diegetically, the shadow means that fate is smiling on you for a while.<br/><br/><b>The shadow eats XP.</b> Every shadow in the party saps away a full share. So if there are two players and two shadows, and the party gets 100xp, that means each of the two PCs get 25xp each. The shadow doesn't have its own stats. It has the same max hp as the PC it's shadowing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474766/#Comment_474766" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T08:26:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  8:26AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The shadow is still weaker than a full extra character.

If you take damage from a fireball, it's not you <b>and</b> the shadow both taking damage, it's one of them. (This works differently than healing.) This is also a knob tweakable in playtesting.

More reliable &amp; cheaper in terms of gold. But I think we're just gonna go with the henchmen route instead of the shadow route.<br/><br/>The problem is that their last henchmen kind of abandoned them in the middle of the jungle, b/c a bad call on my part <div class="Spoiler">they came across some jungle-wandering name NPCs the henches had been looking for, and the henches joined up with those people instead. In hindsight, the henches should've told their most trusted PC friend about their real plan (a plan that's not entirely honest to the jungle name NPCs). But, I never really got a chance to do this because their PC friend brainwashed them with glam powers, and I was like "ok that also solves the problem, they're all gonna stick with the party after all b/c they're so glam struck". But then the glam PC's player informed me that the glam blast wears off after one hour. I kinda don't see the point of such a short -lasting glam charm? And anyway the players don't know this but I between sessions rolled out what happened to those long beloved henches and they are dead. They are now frozen corpses and one of their fingers have been cut off. And that sucks because I had so many ideas for what could happen with those henches. But this is the heavy yoke of sim and of rolling things out between sessions. I put their dead bodies on the encounter table.</div> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474771/#Comment_474771" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T09:32:44+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  9:32AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also I subconsciously reminded of the song "dance with your shadow" when titling this thread because of the user <a href="/forums/profile/shadowdance">@shadowdance</a>.
