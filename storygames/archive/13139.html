Or sports films?  Is the game in sports film just a backdrop?   <br/>How much is the game really important to the narrative?  <br/>Are games less formulaic then film?  By that I mean the act of playing a <b>good</b> game, and watching a <b>good</b> film.<br/>How is wanting a good game different then wanting a good book or film?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
