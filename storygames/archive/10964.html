It could also be the system. 4e, for example has very distinct packages of loot that are supposed to be found each level, and AD&amp;D had treasure tables you'd roll on (which could lead to disproportionally low or high treasure amounts.<br/><br/>I think the reason you don't see "find more money" feats (aside from maybe a higher search skill in some games, although this requires there to have been hidden treasure and many GMs will be nice and just give such things to you regardless of skill). Well, on the one hand it doesn't make sense for there to be more treasure someplace just because you have a feat... (unless you're in a CRPG or an MMO). <br/><br/>I have seen some games with "mercantile" skills that let you maximize loot selling profits and open up more merchandise in shops, so it's not completely unheard of. I personally don't find those feats very fun (and their use often ties into people spending a lot of time playing "Accountants and Actuaries" which is frowned upon in many circles). <br/><br/>As for a fix, maybe you could make the loot based on effort (which would require you to not care about simulating anything), make a skill to better get money ("take the teeth! I know a guy who'll buy em' for 4 silvers each!"), or just skip loot and if you still want that get better stuff feel have maybe some alternate system besides looting corpses (maybe an employer regularly supplies better weapons, or the existing equipment of the players unlocks new powers, or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243166/#Comment_243166" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T16:38:40+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  4:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't GMs evil though?<br/><br/>Clinton Nixon's Donjon puts treasure decisions in the players' hands by allowing them to specify one thing per point of victory.<br/><br/>But if you insist on playing with a GM, it's your fault for putting up with it.

CRPG/MMOs making it fun by having the computer crunch the numbers for you in real time and provide cute little avatars and graphics. However, that's not how they make the economic-aspects fun. Usually, the economic item hunting is lengthy, tedious, fiddly and full wiff moments. I was discussing this with a psycho major and they figured the reason 'grinding' doesn't derail the whole game is built as a very intense positive feedback loop, not unlike slot machines. <br/><br/>If you can exploit the thrill of risk-taking and gambling, as mentioned above, in your design as well as the comfortable hording and intellectual exercise of "Accountants and Actuaries" then you could make it as fun, if not more so.<br/><br/>As an aside: my understanding of EVE Online, having never played it, is MS Excel: The MMO.

If you see stats as just representing a character's physical and mental traits, then no, but if you think of the character's stats as <i>indicators of the likelihood of given events happening to the character in the shared fiction</i> then it seems just as logical to have a stat that makes you more likely to find treasure as it is to have one that makes you more likely to hit monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243264/#Comment_243264" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T09:07:01+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  9:07AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>In<a href="http://billwhite.blogspot.com/2009/04/fourth-age-story-gaming-d.html" rel="nofollow">my D&amp;D 4e mini-campaign</a>, I would occasionally call for a "treasure hunt" scene at appropriate moments, which is essentially a skill challenge where you roll an appropriate skill to search for treasure (Dungeoneering, Thievery, History, and so forth), with the DC based on the level of the item you want.</blockquote>\nThat looks really fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243265/#Comment_243265" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T09:16:45+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  9:16AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>In<a href="http://billwhite.blogspot.com/2009/04/fourth-age-story-gaming-d.html" rel="nofollow">my D&amp;D 4e mini-campaign</a>, I would occasionally call for a "treasure hunt" scene at appropriate moments, which is essentially a skill challenge where you roll an appropriate skill to search for treasure (Dungeoneering, Thievery, History, and so forth), with the DC based on the level of the item you want.</blockquote>\nThat looks really fun.<br/><br/>You know, it really was.

The important factor was that they would then use that gun/grenade/shield rather than the default for their type.  Thus if they were to receive a particularly good item a generic mook could become nearly a mini-boss in difficulty or an actual boss into a truly fearsome monstrosity.<br/><br/>A way I can see incorporating this concept into a rpg would be to use it as something of a player controlled 'difficulty' level.  They can request specific or better loot from the GM, but the counter part is that they indeed have to TAKE said loot from the monsters who should incorporate it into their tactics.  A couple goblin archers on the other side of a crevase may not be too concerning, but if on of them were 'upgraded' to a mage with a staff that flings fireballs and a necklace that deflects missiles attacking him and his minions, that little encounter could lay out a serious hurting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243593/#Comment_243593" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T01:20:28+00:00" title="November 25, 2009  1:20AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha, that's pretty good.

That is, in those games, you only roll to find out <i>what happens next</i>, whereas the contents of the box you're opening is a function of <i>what's happened before.</i> I know some games like to fiddle with that distinction, but in most games that I've played/GM'ed, that's been the norm.<br/><br/>To me, it breaks verisimilitude to have part of the surroundings be so malleable and dependent on a dice roll, especially something as important to the game as treasure. <br/>As a corollary, the better GMs of this style are either good at making snap decisions if you veer off in an unexpected direction, or are good at hiding their random determinations.

The statue weighed a whole lot, and it was a <b>major</b> undertaking (and much interesting gameplay) to get that back to some place where we could sell it. We had to first chisel it out of its mounting, then put it on a series of come-alongs to get it out of the dungeon, then put it on a cart and haul it through across the countryside fending off bandits.  Once we got it to town we still had to find an appropriate buyer without letting the church know that we were selling church property.  <br><br>So that's sort of the macro approach:  make "and take their stuff" feed back in to ongoing gameplay.  You can do this in many ways.  A few that come to mind:<br><br>-- searching the habitation of the defeated foe to find all of the treasure therein<br>-- transporting items back to civilization for sale <br>-- trial and error discovery of an item's powers<br>-- finding an appropriate buyer <br>-- finding an appropriate barter if the item is too precious to be sold for mere money<br/>-- finding someone who knows how to activate a magic item<br/><br/>These can all be ongoing campaign fodder.  Even discovery of an item's powers can be ongoing.  I once had an item that I used for well over a real-time year before I discovered its last power (which came as a bit of a surprise when it happened). "Finding an appropriate buyer" is often more interesting if the PCs' varying skills feed in to this (ie, the dwarf is more likely to know someone who might want gems or jewelry, ...). <br/><br/>So the macro approach involves taking "and take their stuff" and stretching it out into further adventures.  The micro approach is makes stuff-taking into a minigame that is resolved at the time the treasure is found, or one that determines when and how treasure is found (as in <i>Dungeon Construction Kit</i>).  DCK has 2 kinds of treasure cards: Final Item Cards and Treasure Cards.  You get Treasure Cards after each encounter.  Some will be monetary treasure; they are immediately cashed in.  Others have "magic item points."  If you collect enough points, you can buy a magic item of your choice.  After earning enough Treasure Cards, you can activate the Final Encounter (which will award you the Final Item if you succeed).  Some players seem to really dig this minigame, and the treasure cards as a physical representation of the treasure that they are acquiring.  The game's original prototype, in DnD 3.5, used the Appraisal skill and craft and profession skills to help govern how much money you could get for certain pieces of loot.  I sort of wish I still had those to work with in 4E.  In 4E, Skill Challenges could certainly be used to detemine how much cash the group might get for a major piece of loot that doesn't have a ready market.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
