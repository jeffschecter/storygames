When I was designing Heads of State &amp; thinking up the framing situations for different games, I was inspired to create a game about tyrants-in-exile based on a scene in Gabriel Garc\xeda M\xe1rquez's novel  Autumn of the Patriarch: \n<blockquote>\u201c... he would spend the afternoon playing dominoes with the former dictators of other nations of the continent, the dethroned fathers of other countries to whom he had<br/>granted asylum over the course of many years and who were now growing old in the shadow of his mercy dreaming in chairs on the terrace above the chimerical vessel of<br/>their second chance ...\u201d</blockquote>\nIn the game, a group of former dictators all in exile in the same city meet regularly at a cafe to commiserate about their fate.  Immersing themselves in stacks of weeks-old papers that have just arrived by freighter or on the latest international flight from their homeland, they interrupt their fellow exiles, read parts of the paper aloud, and offer their own spin on the stories. <br/><br/>Players choose real news stories for other players to react to in character. After adapting stories into memories of their tyrant's rule and snapshots of their schemes &amp; states of mind, players move tokens representing their tyrants across a track of playing cards, trying to pass through the five 'stages of loss' -  <b>Denial, Bargaining, Anger, Despair, and Acceptance</b>. Dictator tokens are pursued across the track by tokens representing humiliation  and death. (An idea borrowed in part from Zombie Cinema by Eero Tuovinen).<br/><br/>Josh, Judson and I played this game earlier in the week. Heads of State supports different moods of play from very serious to black humor. The premise (and title) of Rest &amp; Relaxation might tend to drive this particular game towards a sort of breezy irony. We chose atypical tyrants, in exile in Bermuda in the 1980s. Josh was the  King of Fiji, deposed by communists. Judson was the exiled ruler of a once-independent Quebec, now subsumed by Canada. I was the former chairman of a libertarian seasteading island off the coast of California, betrayed by my business partners. <br/><br/>3-4 years have passed since the last playtests.  The game calls for, and last time we handed around a hard copy of a daily newspaper. This week we passed around smart phones. Either works. Paper in hand is more visceral and in tune with the source material but we found that phones and laptops give easy access to tons of stories and the ability to search for stories on specific topics, from specific countries etc to challenge other players with. <br/><br/>The articles we got to adapt included:<br/>\t\u2022\tdaughter of mafia boss arrested in bunker<br/>\t\u2022\tapple tv vs. microsoft xbox<br/>\t\u2022\tprohibition on new pet stores in montreal<br/>\t\u2022\thow to fill a ceo job no one wants<br/>\t\u2022\tshould nuns be on the pill? <br/>\t\u2022\tCanada denies extradition request for bangladeshi assassin <br/><br/>It worked well to transform these stories and use them to reveal things about our tyrants. At one point, while I was explaining that assassination contracts were obviously legal on my microstate, Josh said 'I Hate your character.'<br/><br/>The movement/game mechanics needed work. <br/>\t\u2022\tHaving one player start and rotating turns around the table was a problem because the first player to go in a turn gets the opportunity to move the humiliation token to disadvantage the other players. We decided that players should show cards each turn to determine order. <br/>\t\u2022\tAs written, the game is played on a inverted triangular pattern of cards with tyrant tokens moving along the top row, humiliation at the end of the row, and death coming up from below. Because players can only move their tokens back and forth on the top row, they are very vulnerable to getting blocked by humiliation and having death come up to kill their tyrants. We decided to try a square grid so players can dodge and move in different paths.<br/>\t\u2022\tPlayers get a card at the start of the game they can only use to help other tyrants, but we played with some competitive verve and didn't want to help eachother out.  <br/>\t\u2022\tTo give more choice and eliminate need for assistance cards, rules will be changed to give three options: 1. move your token if you have a card equal/greater than the card you want to move to, and <b>talk about your tyran</b>t; 2. move death (if you have a card the same suit as the the one death is on) and<b> talk about death</b>; 3. swap your hand of 2 cards with 2 cards in front of another player's tyrant and <b>talk about that other character</b>. <br/><br/><br/><br/>A question for folks. As written, players agree on the location and time when the game is set but Josh and Judson thought I should decide on one setting &amp; write a bit of color text on it as an intro for players. Do you like the idea of choosing the setting or having a prepackaged setting for ease of play?<br/><br/>R&amp;R needs another run through but it felt good to try a tyrant game after a few years on ice.
