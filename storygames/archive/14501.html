I mean, aside from Minions Inc., which really isn't <i>supers</i> so much as <i>villainous lackeys</i>.<br/><br/>My reason for asking is my regular group is thinking of starting a second game night, with a much smaller turnout (normally, we have 9-10 people playing, while this will be in the much more sane realm of 4-5 people). They're talking about playing Scion, which I don't mind so much (compared to the morass of other White Wolf games), but was hoping to play something less...crunchy.<br/>And so I got to thinking about how much I'd love to run Apocalypse World, if it weren't for most of the other players not being too keen on apocalyptic settings. So I figured, surely someone somewhere has been tinkering with supers and AW.<br/>Anyone?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330301/#Comment_330301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T16:42:21+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  4:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No reason it wouldn't work.

The point I arrived at is: for me, this isn't a good match. I seriously love AW and superheros, but I don't think they match up well. Don't let my thoughts stop you, though.<br/><br/>AW moves need clear, fictional triggers and effects, right? I don't think that covers supers well <i>at all</i>. In comics (not superhero RPGs) the same basic action can have pretty different effect, and may never occur again. One time, Superman used his solar-power storing cells to drain the heart of the anti-sun. One time, Kitty Pride phased a giant bullet through Earth.<br/><br/>I don't think Superman needs a "When you absorb solar power" move, even though the way he actually beat Maggedon was by absorbing solar power. Kitty Pride's phasing might have a "when you phase something else" move but also a "when you phase yourself" and "when you phase through electronics." Fitting powers to moves, in my attempts, you end up with endless lists (so that phasing through this can be different from that) or catch-all boring moves.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure comics are that fictionally consistent: AW is all about honestly portraying the world, but what flies in superhero comics... I don't know how I can honestly portray that world, because it's not very solidly defined. <br/><br/>On top of that, Fronts aren't a very good fit. Fronts tend to be broad: there's this natural disaster, and these people effected by it, and this guy wants to take over your hardhold cause he thinks its the end of the world, and you're stuck in the middle of it all. What do you do? Comics tend to be much more focused. Dr. Doom is doing this thing, right now, what do you do?<br/><br/>That said, I think there is a lot to learn from AW that can be applied to supers games. Variations on countdowns and MC moves are fantastic tools for Superhero gaming. I just think that shoehorning powers into moves is actually not ta very good option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330434/#Comment_330434" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T10:56:19+00:00" title="June 17, 2011 10:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps if the setting starts with something like "Villains have won, now the Earth is theirs" Then you could have a lot of great characters, being the players all ex-heroes, now just trying to survive and keep a low profile.

But I really think that once you sit down to play a superhero game you have already committed to the idea you're going to rescue the kitten from the tree, save the orphans from the fire, etc. You're not going to run into a lot of superheros who will let others handle it or let problems get out of hand.  I think you might end up creating a much more aggressive set of countdowns than most of the examples I've seen.

I don't see a good reason why this would be a fit.<br/>And I've certainly put efforts into making odd fits with Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>In Supers, the characters endure pain because of their relationships and the things they hold dear.<br/>In Apocalypse World, the characters endure pain because of their actions and their choices.<br/><br/>Other systems that can do Supers better:<br/>In A Wicked Age (But maybe without using Oracles at the start?)<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>Any Supers Game (Capes, With Great Power, Spirit of the Century)<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age is great because it demands that all problems be resolved physically, even the emotional ones, which is true of supers. It allows for characters with Super-Powers to take Particular Strengths to model them. The "take damage or accept this hard bargain" effectively mirrors the kind of dilemmas that supers are asked to solve during fights.<br/><br/>I just wouldn't use Oracles to set things up. With Supers, you can just have one person make a villain, one person make a hero, and then everyone else choose to make a Significant Other, a Side-Kick, another Hero, or another Villain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330472/#Comment_330472" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T13:30:00+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  1:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh, Supers and IAWA.

Paul Tevis' near-retirement MI-6 Shifter (shaperchanger) working for "The Window" was enormous fun. I don't think it would work for all supers, but it worked very well for that subgenre, and handled battling Watchers well, with Precogs on both sides.<br/><br/>Also, Steven Gould's original novel <i>Jumper</i> was great, and butchered into a not-good movie, and then re-novelized as a not-as-good <i>Jumper: Griffin's Story</i>.  <i>Reflex</i> is a good sequel to the great original novel, but don't look at it in any way until after reading Jumper, unless you don't mind spoilers.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use AW to run supers, but I'd be very curious to hear how it went from people who try it.
