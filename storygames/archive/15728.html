Everyone had a good time and seemed genuinely interested in <a href="http://rollsomedice.blogspot.com/2012/01/orccon-2012-events.html" rel="nofollow">Living Dungeon World at OrcCon</a> next month -- that doesn't mean they'll go, of course, but still.<br/><br/>The intended scenario was a dry-run of one that I'm running as part of Living Dungeon World, but the players had so much to contribute to the fiction on their own that we barely got to any of that. That means there's plenty of AP to be had without spoiling anything. Yay!<br/><br/>So our story involved:<br/><b>Rema</b>, the human cleric of the god of the downtrodden and the forgotten (the exact name escapes me now, dammit), <br/><b>Hawke</b>, the human fighter with an unusually long greatsword, pitted and bloodstained, left to him by his father.<br/><b>Fenfaril</b>, the elven wizard with nothing to his name but a bag of books.<br/><b>Bug</b>, the halfling thief with a stockpile of poisons and a magical ring of unknown purpose (formerly Fenfaril's).<br/><br/>As the story begins, our four heroes are en route to the town of Three Crossings, answering the Lord Mayor Dolan's call for adventurers. Lately, Three Crossings has been suffering from some unusually vicious, frequent, and well-planned goblin raids, and it's starting to seriously interfere with the three trade routes that intersect at the town. If things keep going as they are, it could mean the ruin of Three Crossings, not to mention the deaths of more innocent merchants and travelers. <br/><br/>Bug's been to Three Crossings before, and is reluctant to return -- last time she was there, she was involved in some, um, "failed business ventures" that made her something of a <i>persona non grata</i> among a certain element of society. Hawke's no stranger to Three Crossings either, or at least one of its citizens, a smith named Black. Black repaired Hawke's battle-battered blade some time ago, and Hawke still owes him for it. Fenfaril's heard some odd rumors about these goblins, but the one that worries him the most concerns their predilection for cruel traps that leave their victims to suffer through a slow death. Rema's heard some rumors as well, but concerning Three Crossings. Why doesn't the Lord Mayor's missive mention anything about the citizens of low station who've been disappearing recently?<br/><br/>While mulling over what the future may hold as they travel along a forested road, one of them steps on a tripwire. There's a snap, then an audible <i>whoosh</i> as giant tree-trunks swing down from either side of the road! All escape serious harm, although a couple packs of supplies are crushed. No sooner has the party narrowly escaped an impromptu flattening than they hear an excited chittering from somewhere in the trees, followed by the sound of soft feet padding away. Rema dashes into the woods and attempts to talk their attackers into sticking around (lest they draw down the ire of her god), but to no effect. Bug catches sight of some odd footprints in a patch of mud -- bare feet, from the looks of it, but lacking toes. <br/><br/>Naturally, Fenfaril knows what this means. These are the tracks of a certain odd strain of goblins who, due to some sort of inherited deformity, don't have toes. Further distinguishing them are their rather odd religious beliefs. They say that in the afterlife their god Worxag, if he is pleased with them, will stab their feet with a five-bladed sword, thus giving them toes as their reward. Among these goblins, there is nothing considered more beautiful and attractive than one of their kind born with toes. So... they're all about toes, really.<br/><br/>Giving up pursuit of the goblins, the party continues on to Three Crossings, arriving just at sunset. In the Inn of the Baffling Halfling, Rema and Hawke regale the patrons with the tale of their narrow escape, while Bug takes the opportunity to pick a pocket and Fenfaril turns invisible to better eavesdrop on the townspeople. While Bug is successful, she immediately attracts the attention of a dark stranger sitting in a corner (every tavern has one). Curious, she brings a couple mugs of ale over to his table to see what his deal is. His name is Cathal, and though he never says so outright, he's clearly part of some sort of criminal syndicate in town. Initially, he chides the halfling for her amateurish efforts -- good enough to escape the notice of a half-drunk farmer, but not good enough to go unnoticed by a professional -- but eventually she talks him 'round to actually <i>aiding</i> the party in its task against the goblins. The goblins aren't good for anyone's business in Three Crossings, it seems.<br/><br/>Fenfaril, standing beside Cathal's chair, hears all of this, the sticks around even after his fellows leave to see what else this criminal is up to. His patience is rewarded when another shady character takes a seat at Cathal's table, and the two talk half in code about various illicit operations and plans. They also speak about Bug, but sound undecided about whether they'll be true to Cathal's vague promise of aid. Eventually, the two of them leave, and Fenfaril sneaks off to the outhouse, drops the invisibility, then comes back into the tavern, warning everyone to stay out of the outhouse for a while. (As he's an elf, the joke is made that it reeks of wildflowers.)<br/><br/>When Fenfaril finally exits the inn, he finds Hawke waiting for him. The other two have gone on ahead to a vacant home -- that of a recently vanished farmer, Forbeck, whose house Rema wants to investigate and Bug wants to occupy for the night -- but Hawke came back to track down Fenfaril. As the two walk through the town's deserted streets in the dead of night, discussing this and that, they're set upon by four cultist-looking guys in classic cultist garb (hoods, cloaks, masks, wavy-bladed knives)! Hawke leaps forward to protect Fenfaril, who, with a shout of arcane words, quickly blasts one of them to death with a magic missile. Hawke picks one of them up and throws him through the wall of a nearby building... and the newly formed hole reveals two more cultists, who have apparently just finished getting dressed for an evening out. Hawke and Fenfaril make rather short work of them, and Fenfaril finishes the last two off with a powerful blast of eldritch energy that topples Hawke, splinters wood, and wakes the entire town from its slumber. <br/><br/>Soon enough, Bug and Rema are on the scene. Bug wastes no time looting the bodies, finding a little gold and a half-dozen wavy-bladed knives, one of which is cold to the touch and makes his skin crawl. Rema heals Hawke and Fenfaril, but as she does so she feels like she is being observed by an otherworldly entity. Among the townspeople who have gathered to see what's going on with this four strangers and their pile of fresh corpses is Black, who instantly recognizes Hawke and demands payment. Hawke offers the cultists' daggers, and Black wastes no time snatching them from a confused Bug. When Fenfaril tells him one of the blades is magical, though, he's all too happy to get rid of it. Casting a spell of identification, Fenfaril determines that it was forged far from here and consecrated in the blood of a hundred virgins. It has a mystic bond with a being From Beyond, and uses its wielder as a conduit of sorts. He too is creeped out just by touching the thing, so when Bug asks for it back, he doesn't object. It's been a long day for everyone, and Black, now all friendly, agrees to house the four for the night.<br/><br/>The next morning, Rema communes with her god, then returns to the bodies of the dead cultists to see what she can learn from them. She asks him if they've been abducting townspeople; he replies "Yes." She asks one of them who they serve; he rasps "Graz'zt." She asks him where there are more of his order; he answers "Everywhere." Know-it-all Fenfaril is on hand to tell everyone all about Graz'zt, the Demon Prince, and his propensity for convoluted plans-within-plans. He reasons that these cultists may very well never have known their true purpose to their demonic prince.<br/><br/>After that, the party went up into the hills outside town, to the entrance of an abandoned mine that the goblins have made their home. Y'know, the part that I'd prepared. In the interest of not spoiling anything for my four potential OrcCon players who may be reading this, I'll stop here. Or maybe I'll continue in a another post, with spoiler tags. Point is, it's late and this is already super long.<br/><br/>All of this improvised stuff was a lot of fun, though. I was especially pleased to see the Carouse move in action -- generally speaking, the DW games I've played or run tend to end with "And the big evil is defeated and you barely make it out with your lives -- the end!", which means these between-adventures moves never see the light of day. I also liked all the Parleying that went on, and how much it added to the story. Things did drag now and then, partially because several times when I was just going to advance the timeline to the next morning or something, a player would speak up with something else they wanted to do right now, so I went along with it. Then I had four cultists with knives jump out of an alleyway.<br/><br/>We used the <a href="http://anarchangel23.livejournal.com/437462.html" rel="nofollow">BBC XP system</a> and fast advancement: one level per 5 XP. By the time we called it quits, everyone was at least third level, which was nice. Rema and Fenfaril were social butterflies, but Lawful Good Hawke, who had both Attack and Defend highlighted, racked up XP like crazy in a fight. If we use this system as-is at OrcCon, we're definitely going to need the new playbooks with 10 levels instead of only five, or everyone's likely to hit their level cap sometime during their second adventure (if not sooner). <br/><br/>Anyway. It was a lot of fun. And I definitely need to cover what happened next, now that I think about it, because there was a pretty sweet Last Breath.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
