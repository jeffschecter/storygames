                    From Judd in the Simmering Thread:<br/><b><i>...and a tarot based fortune in the middle political fantasy RPG.</i></b><br/><br/>Very interesting (I say that a lot, if you hadn't noticed).<br/><br/>In regards to using the Tarot with an RPG, I've seen:<br/><br/>* A tarot substitute used for conflict resolution, in a totally handwavey no-backbone total fiat system (Everway, though it was something new at the time so I can't blame them)<br/><br/>* A free online game or two where the Major Arcana is largely ignored, and the Minor Arcana is used for its number/suit only (to correspond to four abilities, each numbered, adding them together to produce a result).<br/><br/>* Two Japanese RPGs (Tokyo Nova and Blade of Arcana, by the same author) where the game invents a special kind of Tarot Deck of Major Arcana (archetypes), only which are used both to accomplish actions and set the theme, mood and rules of a scene (also chargen elements). Which I view as "higher" in the heirarchy of Tarot-based games, as it uses more than the numbers to sub for dice.<br/><br/>* Finally, an Indie (but huge and well-produced) RPG from Japan called Witch Quest, which comes with a set of about 80 tarot cards, ALL of them (and their major arcana, which seems doubled) designed specifically for the game. Haven't read enough of the game to determine how they're really used (ie if they're used for skills and the like), but did notice that there is an involved conflict resolution system where you actually lay out the tarot in one of several dozen "reading patterns", and flip them one by one to determine success/failure and the like.  I think this is closest to my ideal in using the Tarot, but honestly I haven't had a chance to translate any of that system, so I can't say anything more for sure.<br/><br/>What I'm getting to is: <b> I'd love to see more Tarot-inspired designs.</b>  In fact, I bought a new deck (Rider-Waite, ALWAYS Rider-Waite) the other day as my other deck is a novelty "tiny deck", in the hopes of coming up with inspiration for a Tarot-based game.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, and knowing that others are on the same (or similar) page, I'm wondering <b>what are the characteristics of Tarot cards that can be pulled into games</b>, and for this I'm speaking SPECIFICALLY of the Rider Tarot, because that's the most universal and commonly accepted (as well as awesome). <br/><br/>Here's a couple:<br/><br/>* Numbers and Four Suits. Each suit could represent an ability (ala Castle Falkenstein), and each number could be a number used to overcome an obstacle: Strength 6 + Swords 5 = 11, which overcomes the difficulty of 10!  Unfortunately, EVERYONE who has used the actual tarot in their games have done exactly this, and usually little else. Uninspired. NEXT!<br/><br/>* Colors.  I tried to think of how colors could influence resolution. Unfortunately, most R-W cards have Every Friggin Color on them. <br/><br/>* Positioning: Standard/Reversed, Turning them to the side ("tapping" in Magic the Gathering). These could be used.<br/><br/>* Layout patterns: Using a standard or unique fortune telling pattern could have different meanings, influence conflict resolution, etc.<br/><br/>* Major Arcana: These are different, and special, from the other numbered cards. How could this difference be accented? How could the Major arcana feel... well... Major in a system?<br/><br/>* Page, Queen, King, Ace... Seem "Royal" somehow, different than just another number.  How could this influence the game.<br/><br/>* What are different ways they could be drawn or used?<br/>-No hand, just flip a card when it's your turn to "attack"<br/>-Have a hand of 3-5 or more cards to draw upon, and choose the card you want<br/>-Pick X cards, Use Y of those X cards to establish a pattern or web of cards with which to frame your conflict.<br/><br/>What else is there? Any ideas for Tarot Tricks that might be worth putting in the Toolchest to use later in our designs?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

<p>You spend time in Japan; are you familiar with hanafuda? I get the idea that you could do the same, assigning value to various symbols that <em>aren't</em> suit pips, on the cards. Or you could count the suit pips on non-suit cards as valuable as well, or  a hundred other things. Like for instance the Magician has one pip of each suit, so he's clearly a wild ace. &amp;c.</p>

<i><b>Don't forget that you could do like PTA and have comparison tests, or specialized trumps like FoA.</b></i><br/><br/>Yeah, though I want to think a little bit deeper than "using the numbers for comparison/checks" and "having a realm per suit".  I mean, yo this ain't no GAME, son, this is the MUTHA FUCKIN TAROT deck, yo. This ain't no fool trump. You gots to treat that Tarot right, or she'll fucks you up HARDCORE. (^.^)<br/><br/>I mean, sure, if I were using the tarot I'd certainly make use of the numbers and the suits... but unlike some of the other tarot ideas I saw floating around the past few years, I want it to be more than that, too.<br/><br/>Holy shit, I think I may have had a flash of inspiration. More later.<br/><br/><i><b>You spend time in Japan; are you familiar with hanafuda?</b></i><br/><br/>Yeah, hanafuda are... interesting. To me, they're a game that was flash-frozen in time before it was "really developed" because of old cultural mores to keep things as "unchanging" as possible. But yeah, I get the use of color and flowers involved. <br/><br/>Interesting note on the Magician.                        </div>

                            The Face of Angels is tarot-based. It uses faces synergistically with your protagonist's personality and the type of resolution you use is determined by the suit (intelligence and commerce for coins, authority for swords...). It's only one more dimension than you're talking about, though.<br/>
<br/>
I've long thought that the Majors would make a good route for story development, since they're about the development of a person.                        </div>

<p>This is interesting. I want to talk more about this some time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I had once dreamed up (quite literally, it came to me in my sleep) a game where one plays with Tarot cards whose images are built with like removable stickers; each symbol has a mechanical effect, and you construct your character's card by swiping symbols from the common deck.</p>
<p>I don't know any way you could reasonably implement that in real awake life, but I'd love to see it.</p>

<i><b>a game where one plays with Tarot cards whose images are built with like removable stickers; each symbol has a mechanical effect</b></i><br/><br/>Interesting.  Actually, I was also inspired by the "Renfaire" version of Icehouse (the plastic pyramids agme) that played out strategically using tarot cards as a bas. You literally stacked the pieces on a web of open tarot cards.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that with chips and stones and like, you can do some really cool stuff with resource management and tarot imagery/effect.                        </div>

                            Just another tarot idea to throw out.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine PTA, except each player gets a small hand rather than just drawing one card. They can either play a number/value card as has been described above, or anyone can drop a major arcana to grab narration for a conflict. However, that narration has to reflect the card that was used to take it.<br/>
<br/>
[addendum] I guess what I'm suggesting is something on the basic model of Everway, but with more solidly defined and widely-distributed powers of interpretation.                        </div>

                            Actually, it could still be "Everway done right" if you DEMAND in the rules that "Major Arcana X MUST involve one of the following 4-10 elements: XYZ". That way there really is some definition to the cards, more than "uh, just use the force, feel the flow and make shit up".  Not to hate on Everway, again it was awesome for its time.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hmm.... There's something brewing in my head about this.  Something about the positioning of the cards.  I mean, you know how in every tarot reading layout where each card is located is important?  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Like, somehow, during the course of the game, your narration choices and how you move your cards from one position to another are inter-connected.<br/>

<p>I've been thinking about how best to use in my CyberPunkAnarchoCapitalistExalted idea. More features:</p>
<p>Trumping. Basically, where one suit (ex: Coins) will matter more in a certian situation (ex: Commerce conflict). Moreover, you can consider the Major Arcana to be their own trump over all the "mundane" minor Arcana, and play up the effect of these big effects messing up with the little ones.</p>

                            Wow. Just wow. This is wierd. <br/><br/>I've been playing around with *exactly* this idea, and the POOF! I see it on here.<br/><br/>Thing that occurs to me is, with cards there's so much to them that you can use (as you pointed out, suits, major vs. minor arcana, numbers, placement, and so on) that you really have to just pick one or two to focus on.<br/><br/>The one idea that really gets me that I've been grappling with is the layout idea, which you mentioned. I think it'd be folly to use it like fortune-telling does (ooh, there's death in this character's future), but the possibility that cards could have a different impact or meaning based on <i>where you place them</i> seems totally rockin' to me. I'm still trying to figure out how to incorporate that into a game<br/><br/>Does anyone have any ideas on that? How does Face of Angels use it? I haven't read much on that but playtest.                        </div>

                            Face of Angels has personal trump suits. You can play a card in that suit and trump but only if your powers are used in the descriptions. The suits themselves demand a certain type of action for narration.                        </div>

                            For my husband's birthday game (I run a LARP twice a year, usually on loved one's birthdays, or for New Years Eve and a convention) I used Tarot cards in three different ways.<br/><br/>1) Characters.  Everyone who was there was given a Major Arcana card for their character.  That was the whole sheet: they were encouraged to take the picture and name and "go with it" as to what they were like.  When I handed them out, I gave them each a particular, individual power.  (I had been building a set of characters and mix-and-matching decks, but I ran out of time before the game.)<br/><br/>2) Challenges.  Before my husband could add characters to his party, he had to defeat a riddle/challenge based off each Major Arcana he met.  ("The Magician" was based on the idea of "personal power," for example.  I wrote these down ahead of time.)  The trick was that he could use a character's power ONCE to help defeat another challenge.  ("The Magician" had the power to ask the GM for a hint.  "The Lovers" could combine two powers into additional strength.  Things like that.)  <br/><br/>3) Crosses.  He could at-any-time "cross" the challenged card with Minor Arcana (drawn randomly) and we decided then, based off the meaning of the card, how that moved the overall adventure.  ("The Eight of Cups!  You're on a quest!")<br/><br/>If I were developing this for something more than a one-time thing, I'd probably qualify each card as having a specific meaning, and then we could work it as a boardgame...                        </div>

It uses a Tarot deck for both resolution and content-focusing. Cool stuff. The game's main character is The Fool and players write flashback scenes around how they interacted with the Fool, using a draw from the Major Arcana to guide the content for each scene.                        </div>

                            I believe someone mentioned the game "Zarcana" above - it isn't really an <a href="http://wunderland.com/icehouse/" rel="nofollow">Icehouse</a> variant, it just uses the Looney-Labs Pyramid Set as game pieces, although flat counters with directionality &amp; a reverse will also work.<br/><br/>Zarcana is actually the game that first got me interested in using the Tarot in a game. <br/>Although Zarcana uses the cards to build a board upon which you set your pieces, i've mostly toyed with using the Tarot as either a "magic system" or as an entire conflict resolution system, much along the lines given earlier in this thread. (My work/play was for tabletop wargames, not RPGs, however.)<br/><br/>The best of these was probably the one in which you constructed "spells" out of a draw of X cards from the full 78-card deck, using the Suites to determine the effects of the spell, and with the Trumps having very powerful (and often global) ancilliary effects. It didn't use the numbers at all, but the meanings of the cards were used in an a priori fashion to set the set the spell list. (like Zarcana)<br/><br/>So this new little game i came up with is kind of interesting, in that it goes back to using the Tarot to make a sort of game board to guide play. Full circle, eh? <br/><br/>Here is a link to the revised (and renamed) Zarcana rules, in case you're interested: <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/games/Gnostica/GnosticaRules.html" rel="nofollow">Gnostica</a><br/><br/>(and i signed up to this forum just to post about this; oh, vanity thy name is mine)                        </div>

                            Back in 2000, Anoch games produced a fascinating little Trading Card Game called "Mystick".  It was Tarot based, and while it was CCG-like, there were only 4 decks in toto (I believe) and the deck buildign rules were very strict.  It made use of a lot of classical (and public domain) artwork (pictures <a href="http://www.themysticeye.com/pics/mystick.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and tied the whole game into the kind of mystical conspiracy that suits such material so well.  Pretty neat game, all in all - played a basic bead-grabbign game with the main cards, and played out the major Arcana into a cross over the course of the game, with them causing one time special events.<br/><br/>Most intriguingly, they talked about expanding the setting into a "Collectible RPG" which absolutely piqued my curiosity.  Unfortunately, they pretty much went out of business and the promised RPG never materialized, much to my chagrin.  I admit, I was very curious to hear how they were going to handle it.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Hey dude, can you link us to something you found particularly cool?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>ps: Is it just me, or is the Rider-Waite tarot the best tarot in the universe, to which all others are just pale shadows in comparison?  I seem to be able to find Pretty Tarot (and lots of Ugly Tarot), but I can't find Pretty Tarot that still retains that huge level of symbolism, mystique and especially openness to interpretation (like minutia in the background, etc) of the Rider set. I at one point had a few sets, but ended up selling them because they were pretty, but expected you to know all the meanings of the upright and reverse for every card, and were just a "pretty picture hyperlink" which really didn't contain a lot of the "meaning" save for like the two or three big elements.  There's a lot of subtlety, nuance, and random shit all over the Rider set that really gets the juices flowing in a way that prettier sets just can't do.<br/><br/>Rant over.  But, this is also a roundabout way of saying, "Hey, if you know of another tarot that has as much nuance and interpretive images as the classic Rider-Waite, please hit me with the name.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>See, I'm not a real fan of the Rider-Waite at all.  Couldn't tell you why.  It just doesn't ring for me.</p>
<p>I've toyed with making my own tarot deck, but at this point I think that I'd be departing so massively from the original symbolism as to render it moot.</p>

                            Hi Sempiternity<br/><br/>Yeah, it's all classical artwork, by which I mean public domain!<br/><br/>As for how Swansong works its kind of a fusion between a classical rpg and a Forgean game. <br/><br/>The system works by tarot based task resolution - generally high card wins, but players also have the option of caching major arcana and using them to alter the narrative later on. <br/>The combat system is probably one of the best features of the game - its very fast and theres lots of tactical thinking and bluffing involved (but not pages of crunch).<br/><br/>Play itself is very open (classic rpg) but the game works by each PC having a specific drive (like a kicker) which they are driven to resolve. As all the PCs set about resolving their drives they become more aware of the meta-plot - the machinations of The Prince of Darkness (the adversary) as determined by the GM.<br/><br/>There's more, including a demo version <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/swansong.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>Edit: I forgot to add I just got the Fradella Adventure Tarot today, it's really cool, now I can write a Swansong mod for a supers game!                        </div>

                            I once briefly toyed with the idea of using Tarot with spreads as a scene-scale resolution mechanic, but got distracted by shiny things. I think I imagined the players as being gods of fate/fortune or something like that. The mechanic is currently too vague to be usable, but I suppose it might spark some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanic involved laying out a spread for the scene, with different cards explicitly tied to different characters/game elements. The locations in the spread would be related to the traditional locations, e.g. a simple Past/Present/Future, with added locations explicitly showing stakes for different sides. Then players could spend some resource to switch out cards in the spread for cards in their hand or elsewhere in the spread. At some point, play would stop and the scene would be narrated.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I couldn't figure out was how to keep everybody from squabbling only over the "Future" location or whichever one was most directly tied to the conclusion.                        </div>

                            While I'd have to say my two favorite "traditional" decks are the Rider and the <a href="http://www.archeontarot.com/" rel="nofollow">Archeon</a>, my favorite by far is the <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/osho-zen/" rel="nofollow">Osho Zen Tarot</a>.<br/><br/>While cards in this deck are theoretically divided into four suites, you wouldn't really know it to look at them. Each card has one phrase written on it - Creativity. Change. Hopelessness. Beyond Illusion. Perfection.<br/><br/>While the lack of a numerical value makes these cards next to worthless in many varieties of conflict resolution, they constantly spark my imagination in a way that convinces me that there <i>must</i> be a way to integrate them into a game. Thus far I've settled on building small "mini-games" around them (for example, one was a gambling game played by Nobles in my Nobilis game a few years back).                        </div>

                            As for Tarot decks, I have always been a Thoth deck sort of guy--I just can't get past the lack of gender parity in the standard Rider-Waite and its variants.  The Rider-Waite always seemed so stilted in its imagery, too mechanical for my tastes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway--does anyone remember a game called Psychosis (I think from Chameleon Games)?  You created your characters by drawing from the Tarot deck and resolved challenges based on the sorts of suits and their value.  The Major Arcana caused the game conditions to change.  At certain points in the game you could discard some or all of your cards, thus rewriting your character.  Somewhere I actually have a copy of the thing...I remember it being very quirky, meant to emulate the shifting sense of reality experience by a complete schizophrenic.                        </div>

                            I can't believe that I didn't see this post before; I worked on a tarot based system just yesterday for my knight game.  It's rough, but based on the "you are who you know" concept.  I'm not very experienced with tarot cards, but I thought that the Celtic Cross spread looked pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
It's still half baked, but the basic idea is that in the beginning you pick a signifier card for your character.  Every player has a hand.  To resolve conflicts, it's like a L5R duel, players take turns putting cards face down in front of them until one says "call" and all the cards are revealed.  Then you add up all the minor arcana (with a stat maybe) and the one with the highest total wins (one of my problems is that the range of numbers are pretty big, I might have to have some sort of 1-4 = 1, 5-8 = 2, 9-knight = 3 and queen and king = 4).  Major Arcana act as trumps.  if you play one and then your opponent calls, you win, unless your opponent played a higher numbered trump as his last card (and the Fool trumps all trumps but can't trump regular cards).<br/>
<br/>
The last card played by the winner must be used in the narration and placed into his spread (just the Cross part of the Celtic Cross until it is filled).  The card now signifies an NPC influence on that character's life that reflects and reveals part of the character.<br/>
<br/>
Like the first card that you win is said to "cover" you, it is your character's Cover.  It is an NPC that reveals your strength, and when you get that card, you narrate who this NPC is and what strength your interactions with them reveal (so maybe you win a sword fight thinking back to your mentor who taught you how to fight or more symbolically, you win a contest so your ship doesn't crash down onto a planet, but while doing it you butt heads with the ship's doctor who demonstrates the same "love of family" that is your character's strength).<br/>
<br/>
This continues with your Cross,a figure that shows your weakness, and so on until you have played six cards ending with your Future, a guide like character.<br/>
<br/>
And then the fun can begin. :)<br/>
<br/>
After all of your cross is filled, you can then use the cards in your cross backwards to win contests.  You can reject your Future (turning your back on his or her advise) forget your Past (an ally or other character that wants things to remain with the status quo or reminds you of better days) give up on your Crown (your highest ambition like a role model or a love interest) disregard your Root (a sidekick or someone that grounds your character) surrender to your Cross (an NPC that reflects your weakness) and then finally you can betray your Cover.  (It's funner writing about reversing the cards then playing them).<br/>
<br/>
After that, you can start on working on your Staff portion of your Celtic Cross spread as your knight embarks on a Quest to save the world and herself.  I'm not sure on how, but after betraying and turning your back on everyone who made you who you are, I hope I can make this bit as much fun.<br/>
<br/>
It's all very new and confusing in my mind, but it's helped to write it down.  Thank you for listening to my rambles.                        </div>

                            I must have overlooked this thread. I've been waiting to use Tarot for Sorcerer for some time, and I wrote up rules about five or six years ago for WFRP (a very conventional rpg) to make the game a little more narrative. I submitted the article to a magazine, but I'll post it below... But you can see how I was struggling with the issue of narrative control in traditional rpgs, something I've just about given up on and instead wandered over towards indie-games.<br/>
<br/>
TarotHammer (Using Tarot in WFRP)<br/>
<br/>
	WFRP already has system of resolution, a series of dice-related mechanics intended to simulate the whim of the gods, the wiles and whims of fortune, and a whole host of more mundane factors. This article is going to consider the possibility of adding another mechanic, or replacing entirely the existing system, with a mechanic based upon Tarot cards. While it may seem controversial, or even misguided, this article seeks only to explore the possibility and make some suggestions on how this could be accomplished. The idea may not appeal to all players, but the article seeks to offer a whole range of possibilities for those willing to experiment.<br/>
<br/>
	Contemplate for a moment the nature of a die roll. A die roll can only tell whether or not one succeeds or fails in a roll. It is an either/or proposition: either success or failure. What the roll doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t explain is why exactly the result happened Ã¢â‚¬â€œ why the Watchman didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe the story or why the arrow didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t strike true. What if the task resolution suggested something other than whether or not an action is successful, but why. Perhaps the Watchman is in a foul mood over family problems and unwilling to give anyone the benefit of the doubt, or the glare of the sun turned the archerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aim off a small amount. The Tarot cards can serve as a means of opening up task resolution from a yes/no proposition to an interpretive one, where chance plays a role, but the imagination and creativeness of the GM and players are just as important.<br/>
<br/>
	A die roll provides an instant answer: there is little interpretation. By replacing that numeric value, with a symbol, greater interpretation is allowed, and their is greater freedom for players and GMs to decide and describe what truly occurs. The very act of interpretation and improvisation can greatly enhance role-playing, participation, and inspire the imagination of players and GM alike. Each card bears symbolic significance, and by taking the meaning of the card into account, the resolution through Tarot cards explains not only if, but also how or why.<br/>
<br/>
	Lets move to the concrete, and take for an example a Noble dueling with a rival, and a burglar crossing on a tightrope to a rooftop. The card Ã¢â‚¬Å“The TowerÃ¢â‚¬Â appears, featuring a Tower being split with lightning and its inhabitants spilling out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an ominous card indeed. The card suggests disaster, but not one resulting from human foibles, but from an act of nature, or the failure of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creations. In the duel, the card may signify the snapping of a blade or a cloak tangling up the duelistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arm. For the Burglar, it may signify an unexpected gust of wind, or to the BurglarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chagrin, a treacherous rope that decides then to snap. Perhaps another, more obscure card was drawn, the Seven of Swords, known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark GirlÃ¢â‚¬Â. In the Duel, perhaps the blow is averted as the dark-haired daughter bursts into the fight, or perhaps the Burglar is observed from below by a dark-haired woman. In each case, the cards introduce an unexpected twist of events, that may challenge the players to think beyond just the success and failure of a die roll.<br/>
<br/>
	Thus the Tarot not only ends mere yes/no task resolution, but they add an element of the unpredictable. There is a world outside of the players, and the whimsical nature of the Tarot card can help induce players and GMs to consider the world outside and the influence that it plays in the game. All too often games become myopic, focusing on the minutiae of the playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and antagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions without taking in the context of the environment. The Tarot breaks the players out of this exclusive engagement, for who knows what may happen the next time a blade is drawn. It may not just be a series of dice rolls to determine who hits who first for how much damage, but a series of unanticipated events that may mean life or death, events that may be beyond the playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ control!<br/>
<br/>
	Rather than just Ã¢â‚¬Å“readÃ¢â‚¬Â the dice, players and GMs will Ã¢â‚¬Å“readÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“interpretÃ¢â‚¬Â the cards. What does a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Five of WandsÃ¢â‚¬Â mean during a talk with a barkeep. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Five of WandsÃ¢â‚¬Â often signifies a happy marriage, wealth, or legacy. Based upon the context, it could mean that the Barkeep is in a good mood, being happily married and eager to talk to people about his newlywed. Perhaps it means that the barkeep is attracted to one of the players. On the other hand, it could mean that the barkeep is reluctant to talk until the players spend some wealth. Regardless of the choice of GM or player, they have a greater engagement with the resolution, interpreting and improvising as the situation merits. Hopefully this will result in players becoming more engaged with the story and the context, as everyone works together to fill in the details.<br/>
<br/>
	The Tarot card may also enhance the drama in what would normally be mundane dice rolling. On a roll to hit the Ã¢â‚¬Å“DevilÃ¢â‚¬Â card is drawn, or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Five of CupsÃ¢â‚¬Â: a lone figure standing amidst spilled goblets. What do omens do they herald? The image on the card may instantly suggest drama in a fashion that pips on a die do not. Not all cards have such a dramatic impact, true there is Ã¢â‚¬Å“DeathÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FoolÃ¢â‚¬Â, and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“DevilÃ¢â‚¬Â, but there are far more other cards with more subtle meaning, and thus the impact of such significant cards will not suffer. Over time, within a group, certain cards may acquire significance unique to that group.<br/>
<br/>
	Last of the benefits to be touched upon is Ã¢â‚¬Å“themeÃ¢â‚¬Â. The Tarot cards not only give a Ã¢â‚¬Å“thematicÃ¢â‚¬Â feel, but the very interpretation of them can be used to convey a theme or feel. Since the cards are interpreted within the context of the game, the cards themselves can impart this motif. Interpreting the cards with a theme in mind can intensify a campaign about treachery and honor or sacrifice and glory. The cards are but symbols and archtypes, each card with a narrative of its own, and all are open to broad interpretation and can be adapted to fit the theme of any campaign.<br/>
<br/>
	Thus Tarot cards potentially promise a number of benefits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ greater openness in determining the results or consequences of actions and opening up play to a broader range of actors than the protagonist and antagonist. They can help lift the game out of a dice rolling convention, whetting the imagination and encouraging more free form play. The very cards themselves offer an air of mystery and drama to a session, and the act of interpreting makes the players less passive but encourages all to really think about the cards and divine a meaning from them. This act of attributing to the cards significant meaning is also a means to further touch upon themes and ideas that the adventure or campaign may be centered on.<br/>
<br/>
	The proposition of throwing away those long familiar dice may seem shocking to some. However this article provides a whole range of possibilities for using the Tarot. The options that follow begin with gradual, going to the more radical alterations. One adds the occasional Tarot card as an atmospheric accent to dice. Others simply replace the dice with tarot cards, merely changing the d6 and d100 die rolls and resolving them through cards instead of dice. Along the way, the possibilities of the Tarot are considered in various suggestions and options that the GM can do as they please with.                        </div>

<br/>
The Tarot<br/>
<br/>
	Of course, to use Tarot cards in WFRP, one must own a deck, although alternatives with playing cards are mentioned below. The Tarot deck has acquired mystical air about itself, and is the subject of considerable misinformation and myth. Its original intent seems quite mundane, for playing a Bridge-like card game, and the associated mystic tradition is an invention of the last two centuries primarily. Although the associated occult mysticism was attached later, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason to let this spoil the mystery of the deck!<br/>
<br/>
	There are countless decks and books out there, and GMs and players can even download from the internet cards to glue to playing cards to create their own deck. For the intent and purposes of this article, the deck primarily referenced is the Waite-Smith deck, and the primary reference is A. E. WaiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Pictorial Key to the TarotÃ¢â‚¬Â. Those interested are recommended to seek out whatever sources and cards they find appealing.<br/>
<br/>
	The Tarot consists of 78 cards that can be divided into two categories. The first category of 22 cards is what is historically known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trumps and FoolÃ¢â‚¬Â cards but are now known as the Major Arcana. These cards all are titled and have great symbolic significance. They are the first cards numbered 0 to 22 on the Tarot card chart accompanying this article. The second category of cards in the deck is the more mundane Ã¢â‚¬Å“SuitesÃ¢â‚¬Â to use the historical term; the more common modern term is Minor Arcana. These cards number 56 and they share many similarities with the modern playing card deck. They are divided into four suites with Ã¢â‚¬Å“faceÃ¢â‚¬Â cards symbolizing nobility and number cards from one or Ã¢â‚¬Å“aceÃ¢â‚¬Â to ten. The major difference is that the Minor Arcana have four Ã¢â‚¬Å“faceÃ¢â‚¬Â cards, listed in order of importance: King, Queen, Knight and Page. The Suites, listed in order of dominance in relation to and with their modern playing card equivalents are:<br/>
<br/>
Cups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hearts<br/>
Wands (or Ã¢â‚¬Å“StavesÃ¢â‚¬Â) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Diamonds<br/>
Swords Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Clubs<br/>
Pentacles (or Ã¢â‚¬Å“CoinsÃ¢â‚¬Â) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Spades<br/>
<br/>
	Every card has a picture, and these pictures can be used to aid the interpretation. It should be noted that Tarot decks do have an orientation. The person drawing the card places the card upright before themselves. If the card is oriented toward them with the image and title or number right-side up, it uses the normal interpretation. However if the card is upside down, it is considered Ã¢â‚¬Å“reversedÃ¢â‚¬Â, and it has either a different meaning or it uses the opposite of its normal meaning. Whether to adopt a different meaning or to simply subvert the original meaning is a decision that should be made at the start and not changed. Some cards have a historical set of meanings attached to them, one not reflected by merely reversing the standard significance. However consulting a reversed card may be determined to be too complex and burdensome, and thus the group must decide which they prefer.<br/>
<br/>
	Interpreting the Cards<br/>
<br/>
	There is no right or wrong way to interpret a card, for there are countless interpretations and contradictory interpretations for each card. However, the basic meaning of each card should be established by the GM early on and written down. Ultimately it is up to the GM to decide, although a sample table of meanings has been included with the article to help the GM. Permission is granted to photocopy the table. It is the attributed significance of the card that is its most important feature and the thing the GM should consider first.<br/>
<br/>
	That said, even with the basic meanings established, it is important to take into account a number of other factors when determining the card. One of the most obvious is the Title or Number of the Card. The card Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FoolÃ¢â‚¬Â is obviously different from Ã¢â‚¬Å“The High PriestessÃ¢â‚¬Â. Likewise, the number value inscribed on the card can give a GM some information. Is the number on the card for the OrcÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parry higher than the number on the card drawn for the MercenaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack?<br/>
<br/>
	Is the card drawn upside down, or reversed? If so, that changes its meaning. Many cards have an meaning attributed to its reversed aspect, while others may simply just reverse the significance or determine that since the card is upside down something bad happens for the individual for whom it is drawn.<br/>
<br/>
	Some GMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s may not care for the traditional meanings given to the cards and may discard them, turning instead to the illustration on the card for inspiration. Some GMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s may examine each cardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illustration and write up their own significance. Others may turn to the illustration when the historical significance seems of little help. For those players who may not be familiar with the meaning, they too can simply look at the illustration and make a decision based upon that alone. The illustrations are usually laden with symbols and meaning.<br/>
<br/>
	Finally, a GM may take into account the cardsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Suite. A GM may deem that there is a hierarchy: Cups, Wands (Staves), Swords, Pentacles (Coins), or attribute meaning to each Suite. Cups may represent life and spirituality, wands may represent power or knowledge, swords signify violence, and Pentacles/Coins could represent the physical, material, and transitory. Some may trump others.<br/>
<br/>
	There is plenty of opportunity for a GM to make a reasonable assessment of a cardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s significance and value. Should a GM feel even overwhelmed at the possibility, they can just focus on one or two of the various signifiers until they feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
	A Note on Interpretation<br/>
<br/>
The Tarot is not carte blanche for the GM to dictate their every will and whim. They key word here is consistency in interpretation. A GM should provide all present with a copy of the significance of each card, an example is provided with this article, and GMs should feel free to use this one if they so desire. Considerable trust is being placed in the hands of a GM, and they should interpret the cards with not only an nod to consistency, but with the recognition that everybody is there to have fun and participate, not to be witnesses to some storytelling monologue performed by the GM. One way to avoid this is to open up the interpretation, and allowing players to do the interpretation. A GM may allow the player pulling the card to interpret it, or perhaps the player opposite or to the right. Ultimately, everyone should be encouraged to contribute and have fun. Thus it is imperative for the GM to be consistent and set a good example so that others have a clear idea of what is to be expected.                        </div>

Tarothammer Part 3<br/>
<br/>
Narrative Improvisation<br/>
<br/>
	One of the perks of using Tarot cards is that they can signal an opportunity for a change in narrative, or even a change in narrator. Many of the Tarothammer options listed below suggest opportunities for what is termed Ã¢â‚¬Å“narrative improvisationÃ¢â‚¬Â. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Narrative ImprovisationÃ¢â‚¬Â is simply when, for a short time, the player (or perhaps the GM) takes control of determining what occurs, rather than the dice or GM caveat. It may be as brief as a single action, where the player determines whether or not they are successful at striking their enemy and how hard, or whether or not they are able to find an inn open on a rainy night.<br/>
<br/>
How long the character assumes narrative control is up to the GM. At the minimum, it is suggested that the player gets to determine the outcome of a single act or what constitutes a single Test. They may have a sentence or two to describe what happens. The player is given great latitude, and they should not abuse it. A GM reserves the right to deny a character the opportunity should it be central to the story. On the other hand, the GM can allow a player total narrative control of all that happens for the rest of a round, or to describe what is going on around them. This gives the player an opportunity to introduce some event that they would like added to the story. Clearly stating that the character finds a bag full of gold is abuse and can be disregarded by the GM.<br/>
There is really one rule when a player assumes narrative control: the player asserting narrative control should show respect to their fellow players, the GM, and themselves. By extension, this means that a character asserting narrative control cannot make the conscious decision to kill a fellow PC, although a whole range of lesser injuries, maladies, and tragedies may befall them if in the spirit of the game. A player may kill off their own PC during a narrative improvisation, especially fitting for a heroic end. A GM may also kill off a player if they have narrative improvisation, but this is strongly discouraged, it is best to allow the dice (or Tarot cards used as dice) to do the deed then to arbitrarily slay the character.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of options listed below for when to use narrative improvisation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a bewildering number, and it should be clear from the onset who gets to determine the narrative improvisation in each case. If a GM so desires, most of the narrative improvisation can be carried out by them, although if they GM wishes for the players to take a more active role, then the GM may decide that the players will carry out most of the Narrative Improvisation.                        </div>

                            Using Tarot Cards in WFRP<br/>
<br/>
	The following are a few proposals for using Tarot cards as part of or all of the mechanic, relying upon a lot of options and different degrees of integration.<br/>
<br/>
Dice With a Tarot Twist<br/>
<br/>
	YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve invested a lot of money in your dice. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re attached to them. You have some dice that always roll what you want. Whatever your reason, most people are not willing to give up that old role play staple: the dice. Yet Tarot cards can still be integrated into the game. A few suggestions follow:<br/>
<br/>
	Roll your dice as you normally would for all tests and damage. The Tarot cards are only there for accent, when something strange or bizarre happens. In this case, it is suggested that you only use the Major Arcana since their significance is readily apparent and there are fewer cards to have to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
	The cards can be consulted for any or none of following reasons:<br/>
<br/>
-A double is rolled: 11, 55, of 00. The results are dealt with as normal, but a Tarot card is pulled to not only give the event a remarkable success, but a context in which to consider it.<br/>
-Whenever a character wants to use their luck, they can ignore a roll and draw a Major Arcana card, and they must then interpret the card to assess what exactly has occurred.<br/>
-When a character spends a Fate Point, a Major Arcana is pulled to reveal what the will of the gods or the whimsy of luck may offer the character.<br/>
<br/>
Tarot As Dice<br/>
<br/>
	There may be something more intriguing about lifting up a card, with its title and image that is more appealing than rolling a little chunk of plastic. Using cards instead of dice does not necessarily entail a radical departure from standard role playing, instead it can be a nice but perfectly acceptable alternative to dice rolling. A d4, d6, d10, and d100 roll is relatively easy to simulate, particularly with the Minor Arcana. In this case, it is best to use two decks, the Minor Arcana for most dice results and the Major Arcana for special accents.<br/>
<br/>
	Using the Tarot as Percentile<br/>
<br/>
	Most of the Minor Arcana cards already have a 1 to 10 value (Ã¢â‚¬Å“AceÃ¢â‚¬Â to 10) and thus instead of rolling a die, a card is pulled first for the tens and a second card is pulled for the ones. Should one of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“faceÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Court CardsÃ¢â‚¬Â be pulled (King, Queen, Knight or Page), there are a couple of options to choose from:<br/>
<br/>
-The card is ignored and another placed over it<br/>
<br/>
-The card calls for the play of a Major Arcana to be played over it. If the Court card appeared in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“tensÃ¢â‚¬Â location, the effect is dramatic, if in the ones then the effect is more subdued. Either the GM or player pulling the card should choose and interpret the result in light of the Major Arcana card.<br/>
<br/>
-The percentile cards are ignored, and the result is improvised by one of the players at the table. If the Ã¢â‚¬Å“CourtÃ¢â‚¬Â card appears in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“tensÃ¢â‚¬Â place, the effect can be dramatic; if in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â place then the effect should be more subdued. If the Court card revealed was a Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingÃ¢â‚¬Â, then the GM determines what happens. If a Ã¢â‚¬Å“QueenÃ¢â‚¬Â, the player performing the act or drawing the cards decides. If a Ã¢â‚¬Å“KnightÃ¢â‚¬Â, then the player to the right decides, and if a Ã¢â‚¬Å“PageÃ¢â‚¬Â, the player to the left. It should be noted that in such improvisation, no other player can kill off a player Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at worse they can be incapacitated. Only the GM or the card-drawing player may make such a decision.<br/>
<br/>
If used to determine WS and BS rolls, simply reverse the Ã¢â‚¬Å“tensÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“onesÃ¢â‚¬Â place like you normally would for a roll to determine hit location. If a Ã¢â‚¬Å“CourtÃ¢â‚¬Â card results in narrative improvisation, those doing the improvisation should decide the hit location.<br/>
<br/>
Using the Tarot as d10<br/>
<br/>
	The d10 is easy to use, even for a procedure such as character generation. It is best to use the Minor Arcana alone and simply follow the instructions for percentile, but draw only one card.<br/>
<br/>
	Tarot d6 (&amp; d3)<br/>
<br/>
	Tarot d6 is a little trickier to do, but it is possible. It is possible to simply draw and discard until a card with the value from Ã¢â‚¬Å“AceÃ¢â‚¬Â (1) to 6 are found, but most of the cards are usable as d6. A card with a value higher than six is still usable: a 7 becomes a Ã¢â‚¬Å“1Ã¢â‚¬Â, 8 a Ã¢â‚¬Å“2Ã¢â‚¬Â, and so on, with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“PageÃ¢â‚¬Â becoming a Ã¢â‚¬Å“5Ã¢â‚¬Â and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“KnightÃ¢â‚¬Â a Ã¢â‚¬Å“6Ã¢â‚¬Â. On the Tarot table, each card is listed with its associated d6 value for ease. The exceptions are the two last Court cards: the Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingÃ¢â‚¬Â and QueenÃ¢â‚¬Â. If these are drawn, players can either ignore the card and just draw another, or on a Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingÃ¢â‚¬Â result the GM can determine the numerical result or improvise and on a Ã¢â‚¬Å“QueenÃ¢â‚¬Â result the player drawing the card gets the opportunity. A d3 result is easily attained by simply having the d6 result.<br/>
<br/>
	Tarot d4<br/>
<br/>
	Using the Minor Arcana, it is exceedingly easy to get a d4 result, simply ignore any number and just look at the Suite. A Cup is Ã¢â‚¬Å“1Ã¢â‚¬Â, the Wand or Staves is Ã¢â‚¬Å“2Ã¢â‚¬Â, the Sword is Ã¢â‚¬Å“3Ã¢â‚¬Â, and the Pentacles or Ã¢â‚¬Å“CoinsÃ¢â‚¬Â is 4. Alternately a GM can use the value of the cards (Ace, 5, 9 = 1; 2, 6, 10 = 2; 3, 7, Page =3; 4, 8, Knight =4). If a GM chooses the later scheme, they can allow the Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“QueenÃ¢â‚¬Â cards to be narrative improvisation cards as in the d100, d10, and d6 above.                        </div>

                            Tarot Part V<br/>
<br/>
Incorporating the Major Arcana<br/>
<br/>
	When using the Tarot to simulate dice, the Major Arcana can complicate things considerably. It is possible to add them to the deck as well and use them with numerical values, since on many decks the Major Arcana are numbered. On the Tarot table, all the Major Arcana are given d10 and d6 values if a GM wishes to use them as well. If using d10 or d100, two of the Major Arcana do not have values Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they can be ignored or used as narrative improvisation cards, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“FoolÃ¢â‚¬Â can be used by the player, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â gives the privilege to the GM. Likewise, if using the d6, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“FoolÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SunÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Judgment/Last JudgmentÃ¢â‚¬Â, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â cards can be ignored or used as narrative improvisation cards.<br/>
<br/>
	For those who wish to use the Major Arcana as accents while using the Minor Arcana as randomizers, there are a number of options they can choose from. <br/>
<br/>
-They can be used as described above under Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dice With a TwistÃ¢â‚¬Â using any of the options listed there.<br/>
<br/>
-A character can choose their Ã¢â‚¬Å“SuiteÃ¢â‚¬Â to represent them. Should they draw percentile cards that are of the same Suite as their chosen Suite, a Major Arcana is immediately pulled to resolve the action, with the narrative improvisation done by either the player or GM (this should be determined before play) <br/>
<br/>
-Each player and the GM can choose one Major Arcana as their card to symbolize their character or their role to play. The Major Arcana cards representing the players (and possibly the GM) then mix their cards in with the Minor Arcana. Should that card be played, regardless of who draws it, the player indicated by the card carries out the action using narrative improvisation.<br/>
<br/>
-For a very narrative driven campaign, the Major Arcana can devoid of any use as a randomizer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ every time a Major Arcana is drawn, it triggers a narrative improvisation. For those considering this option, it should be noted that roughly every third card will result in a game that moves far from the random die roll and the majority of results will be narrative improvisation.<br/>
<br/>
-The GM adds a Ã¢â‚¬Å“PlotÃ¢â‚¬Â card to the Minor Arcana deck. They may hold it aloft, a card symbolic of their adventure, although the GM is not obliged to reveal how exactly that card is significant. When the Ã¢â‚¬Å“PlotÃ¢â‚¬Â card the GM has designated is pulled from the Minor Arcana deck, the GM then uses narrative improvisation to advance the plot or resolve an action in a manner that the plot is advanced. On the other hand, something may occur off scene that changes the plot dramatically, and the card is merely an obscure form of foreshadowing.<br/>
<br/>
Complete Tarot Narrative<br/>
<br/>
Easily the most radical of all, the Tarot cards are not used to determine the die values, instead when an action is carried out, a single card is pulled and based upon the situation the GM or players improvise. No rolls are made, no damage rolled; everything is determined by the characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abilities, the situation, and the cardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s significance and whether or not it is reversed. This style of play is only recommended for the brave and experimental, those interested in diceless mechanics, or those with considerable experience with story telling and improvisation games.<br/>
<br/>
Advice on how to run such a game is far beyond the scope of this article, but some guidance can be offered, and those looking for more information should look into the pioneers of this genre such as Theatrix, Once Upon a Time, Amber, Saga, and Noblis for further guidance.<br/>
<br/>
	Some suggestions: <br/>
-Everyone should have a reference sheet with the significance of each card listed on it.<br/>
<br/>
-Everyone should be familiar with the meaning of the cards, or the room well lit enough so that everyone can easily consult their chart.<br/>
<br/>
-When a person has narrative control should be established before the game ever begins. The player drawing the card usually has control, although some exceptions may exist, for example they pull a card that represents another player (as described in one of the options under Ã¢â‚¬Å“Incorporating the Major ArcanaÃ¢â‚¬Â in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tarot as DiceÃ¢â‚¬Â section). Normally the GM gets to assert narrative control if a player spends a Fate Point.<br/>
<br/>
-Characters only have narrative control to describe their characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions, unless GM decides otherwise or incorporates a mechanic to allow characters to gain narrative control.                        </div>

                            You could work with a custom-designed Tarot deck, which could simplify and/or add elements.  A friend of mine commissioned a Tarot deck for his game <a href="http://larpguy.home.mindspring.com/" rel="nofollow">The Zero Movement</a>.  While the game seems to have pretty much stalled, you can check out some of the art here: <a href="http://www.robertscottart.com/tarot.htm" rel="nofollow">The Urban Tarot</a>.   (The artist also has a black-and-white tarot <a href="http://www.robertscottart.com/silhouette.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I'm not sure it would be equally useful for play.)<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Yeah, that "CyberPunkAnarchoExaltedTarot" idea of mine is basically coming from a desire to turn Robert Scott's Urban Tarot into a game. Given that only the Sword cards (and a few Major Arcana) are available, I'm even tempted to limit protagonists to that particular suit...</p>

                            Firstly, can I say that this community rocks? Not only are you (almost always) excellent to one another, the sheer concentrated weight of creativity here regularly rips holes in the fabric of reality and releases Things. I hope I can contribute to that.<br/>
In an attempt to do so, here is my thinking so far on a Tarot-based story game called Dreams of Power. (I know some here don't like "of" in a game name, but it's the absolutely right name because you can read it two ways, as will become evident.)<br/>
Actually, it's two games, the Exoteric Game (played with the minor arcana) and the Esoteric Game (with the major arcana). I haven't fully figured out how to tie the two together yet.<br/>
The scenario is court intrigue. The players (up to 8) take the personae of the first eight cards, the ones numbered 0 to 7 (because Tarot was invented by a time-travelling C programmer, evidently): the Fool, the Magus, the High Priestess, the Empress, the Emperor, the High Priest, the Lovers (the Emperor's heir and his bride, played as one unit) and the Chariot (the Captain of the Guard).<br/>
In the exoteric game, these characters dream (figuratively) of power over one another, and this is represented by "climbing the ladder" of the minor arcana. Each player holds, at any time, one card from each of the four suits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Coins, Cups, Wands and Swords. Each of the suits has a number of different associations; for example, Coins is associated with the element of Earth, the body, worldliness, commerce and wealth, and temporal power. I haven't finalized the associations yet; there are a great many options to choose from in the literature.<br/>
Each character has a unique combination of primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary suit, more or less based on what you would expect for that character. (This is why there are eight: two primary in each suit, for extra conflict.) <br/>
The aim of the exoteric game is to improve your holdings in the suits by a slightly Clue[do]-like mechanism of challenge-and-compare-cards. The challenge is directed to a specific other player, and takes the form of narrating a court-intrigue action that you take, based on the cards that you hold.<br/>
For example, the Empress holds the Three of Wands and the Two of Swords. She thinks the Fool may have a card she wants: the Three of Swords. Wands represent (among other things) male servants, and Swords (among other things) speech. She says, "This is about those three jokes you told about me. I send three of my servants to your room to beat you up." She shows the player of the Fool the Three of Wands.<br/>
The Fool may, in turn, state: "I've slept with your chambermaid twice in the past three days, and she warns me to escape." He shows the player of the Empress the Two of Coins (the body, worldliness, sexuality) and the Three of Cups (female servants). His total pips beat hers and she has failed, unless she holds other cards which she hasn't used yet and which she can throw into the mix (and which the Fool can't counter with further cards). Neither of them can use Swords because that is the "suit in question".<br/>
Now, in this encounter information has been exchanged about the cards the two players hold, and if the other players are alert they can interpret the information accurately and guess what cards are involved (though only the two players know for certain). This can assist them in planning other intrigues. Also, facts have been established: The Fool has been telling jokes about the Empress, and has slept with her chambermaid. These facts continue to be true and can be used as levers in future encounters.<br/>
I'm thinking about a "cynical victory" provision, in which a player who is totally outmatched (is challenged with a single card greater than the total of all his or her pips) shows all of his or her cards to the challenger and explains why their attack doesn't actually hurt. For example, if someone kidnapped the chambermaid, the Fool's cynical victory could be to show that the sex wasn't that good and he was only using the chambermaid to get information. This should have disadvantageous consequences in the esoteric game, perhaps that you can't traverse the path which represents the character over whom you have gained Cynical Victory. (What that means will hopefully become clear shortly.)<br/>
Characters can ally, and indeed must do so to win higher cards than those initially in play. I'm thinking something like: Between us we hold eight Cups; if we describe, using others of our cards, some ploy that would win us eight Cups (not against an opponent), I will give you my Five of Cups to replace your Three, and I will get the Eight. (The Three then goes into a discard area, face-up for later use in the esoteric game.) You could also ally against other players to get their cards in a similar fashion.<br/>
I was thinking that the exoteric game would be won by the player who first gains the King of a suit, but the alliance thing would mean that wouldn't work unless there was some payoff for the second player in the alliance, perhaps in the esoteric game. Something like in Iain M. Banks' _The Player of Games_, where as you move from level to level of a game the relative value of your pieces changes, maybe. Or maybe not.<br/>
The esoteric game is played by traversing the paths of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life from the bottom to the top, using the Golden Dawn major arcana associations (see http://www.byzant.com/tarot/kabbalah.asp if you have no idea what I am on about). In order to traverse a path, the player narrates a dream of power (=powerful dream) to the rest of the court. The dream centres on the symbol of the major arcanum related to the path he or she wants to traverse. I'm thinking that also in order to traverse a path, a minor arcarnum related to the starting sephira and one relating to the ending sephira should be "accessible" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ i.e. held by the player or previously discarded. Maybe alliances should work here as well, since you have to start at point 10 and head for 1. <br/>
The symbolism of the starting and ending cards (there are several different sets of symbolism, e.g. as at http://realmagick.com/topics/86/286.html, it would just be a matter of picking one) should also be incorporated into the dream.<br/>
This ties the exoteric game into the esoteric game, but I'm not convinced that the link is strong enough. Thoughts?<br/>
Also, should there be some kind of victory condition - at least acceptance of the dream by the other players Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or non-victory condition, such as a challenge to the interpretation which means the challenger, if successful, gets to traverse the path instead of the original narrator? I'm inspired here partly by Munch-Mausen Tales (http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/Munch-Mausen%20tales.pdf), a very cool little game where you have to tell a tall tale but your fellow players can derail it, based (obviously) on Baron Munchausen. But with dimension-travelling wererats. <br/>
I'm thinking too that there should be an effect of the esoteric game on the exoteric game as well as vice versa, but I don't know what yet.<br/>
The goal of the esoteric game is to reach Highest Crown (the top of the Tree), traversing your own character's path on the way.<br/>
There's a ton more symbolism I could draw in, but it's already pretty arcane and probably not quick to play. Any suggestions, including for major structural revisions, are welcome. This is a sketch, remember.                        </div>

                            I note in the Wikipedia article on the Tarot: <br/>
<br/>
"Italo Calvino described the Tarot as a "machine for telling stories", writing the novel The Castle of Crossed Destinies with plots and characters constructed through the Tarot."<br/>
<br/>
haven't read that one by Calvino, but it brings to mind the fact that you could probably make use of the cards the way Once Upon a Time does - allow narration to change to you if somebody talks about something you have in your hand, or maybe give rewards if you are currently narrating and involve a major arcana you possess.                        </div>

                            Hmmm...Dreams of Power is a nifty idea--and it would be great practice to keep on top of the Tarot card meanings.  I also suspect that the game would be a little different with different kinds of decks, which is also a plus.  The win condition of the exoteric game seems a little too random--could happen too quickly depending on the deal.<br/><br/>As an aside--it would be cool for their to be tree of life shaped board where the players discard their cards.  Especially if you keep the link between eso and exo, that will allow people to see which sephiroth are 'charged.'  Either way, it keeps the esoteric game front and center as the exoteric one develops.  If you have the players moving their cards up the tree, that would be pretty cool--again, doubly so if you go with the idea that the value of your pieces shifts when you are on a 'higher' level.  <br/><br/>One thing that I see as a potential problem: strategically, it is quite advantageous to hold the higher numbered cards (like 10's) in your hand, as your 'big gun.'  However, that means the esoteric game probably can't get started until the exoteric one is winding down a bit and people are revealing there power cards.<br/><br/>Another concern: who gets to go first when one of those ascension options becomes available?<br/><br/>What if you made the entrance condition to the esoteric game a narrative occurrence in the exoteric one--one specific to each of the character types.  I'm a little rusty on my Tarot lore, but I remember that there are some who distinguish two series in major arcana--one the 'lower' and more personal, the other the higher and more spiritual.  So, you could make the entrance condition to the esoteric game a narration invoking the card that pairs with their character card.<br/><br/>For real fun, that narration might require giving up something in the exoteric game--surrendering material gain for spiritual insight.  Again, the sort of narration might be specific to the character type, perhaps allowing <i>another</i> player to narrate that loss to them, so that they realize how drastic the step is.<br/><br/>Perhaps, too, there are narration constraints for each sephiroth--that to ascend the players have to accumulate a certain number of tokens?  They get a token each time they work the sephiroth's constraint into their narration or some bonus to challenges where they embody the sephiroth's values (or both)?  Make almost any court in fighting satisfy material constraints of first sephiroth, but that should change, so it might be that each player, once on the tree, starts to play a different game even as they interact through the intrigue of court--the court intrigue being the 'testing ground' for their ascent.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Isbo, some good suggestions there - some of which I thought of this morning, so they must be organic to the concept. <br/>
My current thinking is that it's all about "standing". Your standing changes as you defeat others (you swap cards and standings, assuming that your standing is lower than theirs). Initial standing is based on the numbers on the cards.<br/>
The play alternates between the exoteric and esoteric games - basically every "morning" the court listens to people relating their dreams of the previous night, starting with the person of lowest standing, and then get into the serious backstabbing. The game starts with an evening so the exoteric game comes first.<br/>
To enter the esoteric game you have to sacrifice (parallel evolution between your and my thinking), offering a card of an appropriate suit or value to enter each sephira. After you relate your dream, your counterpart (Empress if you are the Emperor, etc.) can attempt to "top" you using the same major trump as their dream theme. The rest of the court judges between your efforts; the one receiving more approval wins you the trump to replace your sacrificed card, the one receiving less gets a consolation prize of a court card of the same suit (rising in value as you get further up the tree). You can then use these in the exoteric game.<br/>
Also, reduce the players to six (getting rid of the Lovers and Chariot, which never really fitted). The Emperor, Empress, High Priest and High Priestess each have a suit assigned and they can use a bonus pip to that suit once per "day". The Magus can use a bonus pip to any suit, and the Fool has "Fool's Immunity" - the bonus pips can't be used against him.<br/>
Oh, and definitely the Tree of Life diagram should be physically present in front of the players with the Major Arcana displayed on it.<br/>
I think the remaining weakness is in the assessment of the dreams. That might need to have a points-based system, which in turn could determine "standing" at the beginning of the next day.<br/>
Completion condition is that either someone or everyone has passed to Highest Crown, visiting their own Path on the way. At which point you compare final standings, or else points scored for standings at the end of each day plus points scored for dream narration. Something.                        </div>

Very good stuff there.<br/><br/><a href="http://tarot.eatpoo.com" rel="nofollow">Eatpoo Tarot</a><br/><br/>The idea being that if the information of the card is based on interpretation of the images on the card, it helps to remember that you can go all kinds of nuts with the imagery on the card as well.<br/><br/>A game where you create your own Tarot, fr'ex.                        </div>

                            Yes, nice cards (weird name for a group of artists - or maybe not, thinking about it).<br/>
<br/>
It would be very cool to create a tarot specifically for Dreams of Power, so that you could include relevant imagery for all the associations in the game. But - even though I dabble in art a bit - I don't think I really have the talent, and I know I don't have the time, to produce a tarot deck to compete with the other zillion out there. Plus I'm into minimal-cost, maximal-accessibility games - so it will be "you need these instructions, plus a deck of Tarots, preferably Rider-Waite-Smith - here's a link to a PDF of it if you don't have one and want to make your own." (I don't have the link here, sorry, it's on the other computer and I can't remember how I found it. But there is one.)<br/>

Lee Short's game Star Moon and Cross is also at <a href="http://shadowsinthefog.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shadowsinthefog.com</a> with Chris Lehrics game.<br/>

<div class="Message">
                            I had a game I was working on a few years back that used Tarot as the main task/conflict resolution mechanic.  The game was called Urban Mythos (and yes, this was years before WotC released Urban Arcana).  The setting was the modern world with magic which was all out in the open, well understood and more than a little passe.  It was set in The City, which was the capital of The Kingdom.  The feel I was aiming for was along the lines of "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Wands of Fireball" or "What if Clive Barker and China Mieville wrote The Sweeny?"<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the system with Tarot Cards for 2 reasons.  First, the cards lent this really neat feel that the characters were gambling.  Second, Tarot cards really evoked the magic aspects of the game.  One of the main themes of the setting was the way that the arcane had become the mundane.  What could be more appropriate for that than mass produced Tarot cards?<br/>
<br/>
The cards worked in two ways.  Simultaneously as a dice substitute and a storytelling tool.<br/>
<br/>
The short version goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
Characters have attributes and skills.  There were 4 attributes (Mental, Physical, Social and Magical) and are rated from 1 to 5.  They also have fairly broad skills, which again, are rated up to 5.  When you attempt an action, you decide with the GM which attribute and which skill (if any) are the most appropriate.  you draw that many cards from the deck.  You take the highest suit card, counting Aces as 1, Knights as 11, Princes as 12, Queens as 13 and Kings as 14.  Compare this to the difficulty set by the GM.  If you get equal or more, you succeed.  If you get less you fail.  Each Trump (Major Arcana) in your hand can be used to add two to the value of the highest card as long as you narrate a Deus Ex inspired by either the name or picture on the Trump.<br/>
<br/>
<i>For example, Blake is being chased by a pair of goons with cricket bats.  There's a fence at the end of the alley and he needs to get over that before the thugs reach him to get away.  He has a slightly above average 3 in Physical and a 2 in athletics.  The GM sets the Difficulty to 13, since it's fairly hard as he's under pressure.<br/>
<br/>
His player draws 5 (3+2) cards.  He gets:<br/>
<br/>
Ace of Wands<br/>
Wheel of Fortune<br/>
Prince of Swords<br/>
The World<br/>
7 of Coins<br/>
<br/>
The highest suit card is a Prince, worth 12: Not quite good enough.  Blake decides to use the Wheel of Fortune for an extra +2.  The player states that, fortunately, there is a plank of wood leaning up against the fence that he can use for a boost up to help him get over.  His new total is 14 and he succeeds.</i><br/>
<br/>
There is also a mechanic for extra successes by the number of times you can beat the target of a test, using each card in your hand only once.<br/>
<br/>
<i>For example, if Blake had only needed an 11 for that test, he could have beaten the difficulty twice: once with just the Prince and once with the 7 plus both trumps (7+2+2=11).  That would equal 2 successes.</i><br/>
<br/>
The second way the tarot worked tied into the character's advantages and disadvantages.  Every character had one Positive and one Negative character trait.  these were basically the same as Advantages/Disadvantages, Merits/Flaws or Edges/Hindrances from other games.  But each one had a trump card that went with it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>For example, Blake has an air of respect that means people are more likely to take him seriously.  To represent this, the player chooses The Emperor as Blake's Positive Trump.  He also has a disadvantage which is an attraction to the "wrong kind of woman".  The player chooses The Lovers as Blake's Negative Trump.</i><br/>
<br/>
Whenever a player draws his Positive Trump and uses it in a test, he can add 4 instead of 2 as long as he can narrate a way in which the advantage comes into effect.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever a player draws his Negative Trump, regardless of whether he plays it or not, something bad happens.  This does not mean a failure, but does make the character's life more complicated in some way.<br/>
<br/>
<i>For example, Blake is searching a talismonger's workshop for information on a client.  Suddenly he hears some movement and realises that someone else is in the workshop too.  Hiding, he realises that it's an enforcer from a local mobster, a nasty piece of work Tainted called Sabre-Tooth Tony.  Blake decides to bluff it out.  He grabs a nearby magic sword that looks really impressive and steps boldly into the room with Tony, trying to look as threatening as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Blake's player draws his Social (3) plus Bullshitting (3) for a total of six cards.  The GM draws for Tony, using Tony's Mental (2) plus Balls (4) to see if he can tell that Blake's actually nowhere near as tough as he's making out.  Tony gets a total of 14.  Blake's highest suit card is a Prince (11) but his hand includes both The Emperor and The Lovers.  So Blake succeeds, with style and panache because his "Air of Respect" kicks in with The Emperor for a +4 and also his other trump (The Lovers) adds another +2 for a total of 17.  Tony decided discretion is the better part of valour and bolts from the workshop.  But the Negative Trump came up for Blake.  Since the card, The Lovers isn't really appropriate here the GM gets a bit more creative.  The opposite of love is hate, so the GM decides that Tony is going to see Blake as a threat from now on.  Blake's life is going to be a little more complicated from now on...</i><br/>
<br/>
Not the most original system ever created and I'll probably never do any more work on it now that I've read Mortal Coil.                        </div>

                            Rich,<br>It may not be original (dunno, what's Mortal Coil?), but your play example description was very interesting. I especially like the personal Trumps and the random way they come into play. You should consider developing it more. Query: Would Blake have to make a test to hear that Tony is there or to recognize him? Or does the game not get that testy?<br><br>The system sounds similar to one I've been brewing in the hindbrain, using two decks of standard playing cards. Same four attributes, but I was thinking of having one suit assigned to each attribute (say Diamonds = Mental, Hearts = Physical, Clubs = Social, Spades = Magic). Attribute pools would be filled from deck one according to a character's rating in each attribute (say, 1â€“13). Deck two would be split into the suits and allocated to broad skill pools linked to the four attributes, again based on skill ratings. Players would draw on the different attribute and skill pools for tests against arbitrary difficulty levels. That's as far as I've gotten in my head.                        </br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaettyr</cite>the possibility that cards could have a different impact or meaning based on<i>where you place them</i>seems totally rockin' to me.

My feeling, as someone who has done little more than look at a Tarot deck and read that Calvino book, is that an ideal pattern-based tarot scenario goes something like this:<br><br>During a scene or unit of conflict, players take turns laying out cards in relation to one another.<br>Certain patterns exist which govern some important aspect of a conflict, whether it be means or ends. There are enough patterns that it is not always immediately obvious what pattern players are developing.<br>Interpretation of the individual narrated events is determined by the card played and its relation to existing cards, but not to the pattern. <br>At any point where the cards are arranged in a recognized pattern, the conflict can be considered finished -- at this point the meaning of the pattern itself is applied and the cards are all reinterpreted or twisted or otherwise shifted to fit this emergent framework.<br><br>The goals are:<br><br>* Cards have two meanings, one in regards to an individual event and one in regards to the overall conflict. This means that playing a card to do something awesome in the moment may end up destroying your goal long-term.<br>* Constantly shifting meaning on the conflict level, keeping the outcome generally in doubt.<br>* Tension among players as they both attempt to achieve their individual goals and build towards an interesting pattern. A conflict that ends without a pattern would have lessened effects. Alternately, a pattern that uses a subset of the played cards could be used instead.<br><br>One possibility is to have enough patterns so that players must always end their turn with the cards in a 'pattern', further limiting possibilities of play and guaranteeing that the conflict could be 'done' on any turn.<br><br>I also feel like something based on dominoes could be interesting as a play constraint.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I love the dynamism inherent in that, with or without the underlying pattern game. It seems like an excellent approach for one of these games that concerns itself with establishing meaning over resolving conflict. You could layer a mechanic (tokens?) on top of this to establish degrees of credibility for each played card (a la Verge). (Additionally, adding in the patterns probably allows you to resolve conflicts as well, on another level, by equating a pattern with a particular resolution.)  <br><br><br>Also, i think <a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=82" rel="nofollow">Deborah Donoghue's Arcana game</a> should be linked over here, for its use of Tarot to set character aspects and archetypes!                        </br></br></br></div>

                            It's been two years since I started this thread, and I realized I still haven't come up with a concrete way to use the Tarot in a new way.

                            I would love to use the tarot mechanically, but I think it needs to be designed for the purpose.  That's where my concept of the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.greathundred.org/Great_Deck" rel="nofollow">Great Deck</a> came from, although I'm tempted to have a Lesser Deck which would be more chaotic, add and subtract kind of deck to go with it.                        </div>

                            I love the Osho Zen deck for particular things. If you're looking for the answer to "what am I missing?" or "what should I build on?" it does very well. If you're looking for "What dangers lie in my path?" you should use some other deck. I'm looking forward to picking up the Revelations Tarot some day, because it looks beautiful and easy to read.<br><br>I used Tarot for divinations in my Mage game a long time ago. The better the party rolled, the more I'd twist my reading to reveal things to them.                        </br></br></div>

                            Engel, by Feder &amp; Schwert (not the d20 conversion released by White Wolf) used a custom tarot, and Psychosis, from Last Unicorn, also used tarot cards, but in a very non-tarot way.<br/>
<br/>
The tarot system proposed by Ice Cream Emperor hits upon some real strengths of tarot and uses the cards the way I feel they're best used, for structuring story. Reading the cards don't work very well for action resolution because tarot readings focus on shifting framework categories, not providing details. It is the details that game mechanics are generally relied upon to provide. Details are provided in tarot readings primarily through cold reading, which is known as GM fiat in rpgs, and you don't need cards to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I love using major arcana for initiative (using the cards in a non-reading manner). Everyone draws a card and goes in order according to their card's number. Because the major arcana repeat no numbers, there are never any ties to break.                        </div>
