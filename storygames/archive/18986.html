My preference is gritty fantasy/humour, maybe with an oriental twist, mainly because I can see most of my friends going for this kind of setting.<br/><br/>I've read good things about the Dictionary of MU, but I'm not sure that it doesn't require the Sorcerer RPG (or indeed of its availability).<br/><br/>Any advice would be most appreciated.<br/><br/>Many thanks,<br/><br/>Alan.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
