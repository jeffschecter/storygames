                    So this weekend I had an indepth playtest with a mix of players, via a local gaming club for Drift. I'd estimate it was 60-40 fun to drudgery, including learning the rules and making characters. With only two concerns (reworking difficulty numbers and making impetus costlier to spend), the players had only positive feedback. One of them even asked hopefully when Drift would be for sale. Then I went through and listed nearly a dozen possible changes suggested by the playtest, getting feedback on each. I'm largely convinced the core mechanic needs a complete overhaul, although it seems I was the only one leaving the playtest with that opinion. All in all a good playtest.<br/>
<br/>
The hard part will be ensuring Drift doesn't just become Dogs in space... <br/>
<br/>
But anyway, this seems to be a trend in later steps of my game designs. A fun playtest which hits on 8 out of 10 cylinders compels me to make significant changes, and so on. Pure Shoujo is an excellent example, a game which when it gets going is pure gold, its a matter of ramping up to the action. Because it still requires about 1/2 an hour and at least one socially confrontational player - or bitting the bullet and having a GM. <br/>
<br/>
So what is your idea of a good playtest? And how close should your design be to your goals before you go on to publish it?                </div>

                            Here are some of the questions I would ask, just to get things started:<br/><br/>1. How many playtest groups do you have? More than one is best, with no overlap.<br/><br/>2. How many playtest groups have played without your presence?<br/><br/>2A. Are they able to play the game the way you play the game, without you being there to guide them?<br/><br/>2B. Is EVERYTHING you do to make a fun game actually written in the text?<br/><br/>3. Have they played through full reward/currency cycles of the game? If your game is intended to provide more than just one shots, single-session playtests aren't really going to be sufficient.                        </div>

                            All of what Thor said, which is damn hard.  <br/><br/>This past weekend there were two playtests of Infected, and Eric Provost had the simultaneous luxury and agony of sitting at an adjacent table and not participating in either.  <br/><br/>A truism:  Games are always more fun when you play them with their authors.                        </div>

                            Wow, that is so very much not what I meant to ask ...<br/>
<br/>
By good playtest, I meant "that session we/you just had was a good playtest." Not, "this is the correct way to manage a playtest regimen". I.e. what do you value from the playtest sessions you have.<br/>
<br/>
And, I'm talking about how close you are to your design goals as evidenced with your playtesting, not just if you've met some quota of playtesting. <br/>
<br/>
I've done everything you've discussed for Pure Shoujo (although 2B is a design consideration - there are reasons to leave texts silent), and I am in the midst of doing the regimen for Drift, although I'll be restarting with the redesign. And generally, I've been careful with my local player population, so as to minimally spoil people for playtest cross-contamination. I really don't need another reminder about how playesting works.<br/>

                            Like any other creative thing, I like to discover new stuff. With my current main project, Tokyo Heroes, the first playtest was fun, but not exactly the kind of fun I was expecting. And to me that's <i>awesome</i>. I'm less concerned about my original design goals -- I write fiction too and with that I have to be constantly figuring out new stuff as I go along -- than I am with making a fun game where the various bits fit together nicely.                        </div>
