You were still sniping at each other, but you were also jockeying for position and trying to outrun the other guys. Fun.<br/><br/>By extension, I think a cross-country rally race would be fun, with layovers for repair/refueling allowing for some drama between the teams.<br/><br/>This is all just situation-based stuff, of course, without any major modification to the rules or play procedures. I'm sure there are plenty of things you could do there to ramp up the fun too, but nothing comes to mind right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206137/#Comment_206137" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T14:47:17+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  2:47PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I look forward to reading more Car Wars AP and how well the game system has held up since the 1980s.<br/><br/>I'm brainstorming what more streamlined game systems might support Car Wars fun without the slow parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

We totally RPG'd it the entire time we played...with a GM and missions and adventures and everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main character was Red Ryan named after the Han Solo equivalent from a Star Wars knockoff novel I'd read...although he looked more like King Smoit than Han Solo.  My gunner was Jack Fox...I didn't create him until after I'd worked my way up to a car big enough to need a Gunner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out in the cheapy league...the one where they give you a car for free and if you suvive you get to keep it.  Worked my way up through the arena league until I was renown enough to start getting jobs for road missions...deliver this package, escort this person, clean out that bike gang.  By then I had 2 cars...my tricked out ueber arena car of death...and my optimized for road work long range cruiser of death.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually we ran through the Solo Adventure "Convoy"...which we ran as a regular adventure with a GM...cuz...we had one, so why not.  I started up my own trucking company New Wave Van Lines and hired on most of the NPCs from Convoy to be my employees.  I had an awesome rig with a external sound system in the shape of a giant boom box mounted on it.  The rig was painted violet and neon green and we'd roar through town pumping out 80s pop hits at 1000dbs.  I think the NPC truck driver's name was Templeton Smythe...I'd ride escort in my car.  Later we got the gas powered metal armored car rules and I had a Pick Up truck named Death Blossom (heh).  It had some obscene number of those six shooter rocket packs mounted on it which IIRC you could fire one at a time or all at once.  I basically could do enough damage in a single shot to obliterate any vehicle on the road...then I was done save for a measy MG or 2.  But with a Gas Engine I could accelerate right up on some dude, shrugging off most damage with my metal composite armor...and nail him at point blank range.  It was a one trick pony, but in a convoy...I dropped the hammer on lots of baddies with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time we were done I had a fully armored warehouse defended with VMG towers and AT gun turrets.  A 10 wheet truck with autocannons in the turret and a ramplate, a cargo helicopter escorted by a gunship, a little grasshopper car/copter which could be carried in the back of the rig for special surprises...skills so high I could basically turn my car in a series of 90d slalom turns at 100 mph without wrecking and shoot the tires off of a motorcycle from across the board...and so many millions in cash that I was buying hydrofoil boats to race as a hobby.  Oh yeah...Dragon Magazine published Tank and APC rules for Car Wars...yeah...I had me one of them 8 wheeled APCs...it could steamroller just about anything...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe must have played that campaign off and on for 5+ years.  I bet if I pulled the box set off my shelf I still have the blue print of the warehouse and my drawing of the truck...<br/>\n<br/>\nI was awesome...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206328/#Comment_206328" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T12:23:00+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 12:23PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blood Red Car Wars...OMG...that would be too awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might just have to hack that together for a GPNW game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206334/#Comment_206334" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T12:34:21+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 12:34PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>We never realized that Car Wars WASN'T and RPG.

One of the other duelists in this match <b>has</b> to be the one. All he has to do is watch for the sign - left to be determined after the fact - that certain signature move, or the Ace of Spades card they keep on the dashboard, or the distinctive racing uniform the driver wears.<br/><br/>Rule 1) If my driver wins the match, all other drivers taken out, then the last driver he takes out is the killer. He'll run them down without mercy. Vengeance is satisfied!<br/><br/>Rule 2) If my driver gets killed, then the car that takes him out is driven by his brother's killer. He only realizes this at the last minute. Tragedy!<br/><br/>It was great fun, and I found it informed some of the tactical decisions I made in the larger game.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256653/#Comment_256653" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T12:34:34+00:00" title="February 15, 2010 12:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a blast!

Car Wars is about the strategic (investment in and design of your car) and the tactical (what you do moment-to-moment) in order to win. A lot of fun can be had by changing what that "win" means. We played Capture the Flag as Nerdly last year to great effect. Drivers were scrambling for it when dropped (possible whenever there was a crash, which was more or less every other turn, with the flag flying 1d6 distance in d12 direction), throwing it to their teammate (Drive check), or just plowing the fuck into each other to block for your teammate.</p>\n<p>John, how do the players win?</p>\n<p>If anyone's worked out the reverse engineered construction rules, I'd love to play with them in a couple of weeks with my cousin.

That determines the winning team. Then rank that team to discover who came in 2nd or 3rd or whatever.</p>\n<p>These absolutely stack. So if I help my friend kill his rival right after I damaged him, I get 3 points for that and my friend gets 1.</p>\n<p>Rivals are <em>not</em> symmetrical. My rival is the Humungus. The Humungus' rival is Stumpy Pete, who's on my team.</p>\n<p>These numbers might not be <em>quite</em> right. The biggest benefit is supposed to be for team play: damage your friend's rivals, then let them take the kill. But you want to be the last guy to damage the rival in question before your friend kills that rival, so you might go over and deprive him of those points, hogging them for yourself to the detriment of the team.</p>\n<p>Myself, I generally prefer the "Tuners with machine guns" aesthetic.

You want design to represent hard decisions, not choosing all the prettiest ponies. I really like the Cat 5 range.
