But instead of like Maid where their role is just trapping for bizarre hijinx/adventures, it appears to be a "honobono"/"feelgood" game of simple people stories. Sorta close to "Yotsuba&amp;" or "Azumanga Daioh".

Oh, the linguistic pain!<br/><br/>It sounds like it allows you to emulate any number of Japanese family-life stories and TV dramas, which can range from the tear-jerking to the outwardly strange. I'm not so sure I'd equate it to <i>Yotsuba!</i> or <i>Azumanga Daioh</i> (which to me are far more in the bizarre/surreal/wacky field), but rather to shows like <i>Great Horror Family</i>, <i>Hotman</i>, <i>Anata no Soba ni Dareka Iru</i> (if I remember the title correctly, "There is Someone Near You..."), and perhaps even <i>Shoshimin Ken</i> ("Lower-Middle Class Ken"... or "Proletariat Ken" depending on the dictionary).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310094/#Comment_310094" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T14:01:18+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  2:01PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hmm, maybe not so prosaic if<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.fdiary.net%2Ffamiliesrpg%2F%3FExtendedMission" rel="nofollow">Mr. Google is accurate</a></blockquote>\nHmmm.

I've got no clue what <i>Fiasco</i> is... I honestly haven't really been in game buying mode for a while now, just focused on personal projects and enjoying what I've got.<br/><br/>I'm guessing it's a tough sort of thing to come up with, regardless of whether it's a game or anime. For example, I just finished watchine NieA under 7 and while I dig what was done with Lain, they (for me) dropped the ball with NieA. It seemed like they were going for an Azumanga sort of thing, then it looked like there was a point and then it just sorta...ended. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya seems to sorta be a blend of going somewhere while having an awful lot of apparent pointlessness and "slice of life" stuff. <br/><br/>I dunno. For me it's sorta hard to articulate, but I can point to Azumanga and say, "I'd like to see a game that lets me tell and participate in stories like that." Panty Explosion might be offered up as a way of doing Melancholy of Haruhi (I don't know, maybe it wouldn't be offered up), but it seems to be geared more towards something different than that Azumanga-ish sort of thing which I also think is in Melancholy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310363/#Comment_310363" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T06:00:32+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  6:00AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Raspberry Heaven is the name of the ending theme of the anime adaptation of Azumanga Daioh, and I felt a nice summation of what I wanted my game to ultimately be about.<br/><br/>Well, <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/" rel="nofollow">Fiasco</a> has been getting a lot of attention, and it gets a big thumbs-up from me (I've made four playsets for it after all), but it's certain mechanical elements (especially the setup) that's inspiring me rather than its setting or tone (which derives from Coen Brothers movies).<br/><br/>Azumanga Daioh is a definitive work in what has become something of a genre of its own: 4-panel[1] slice of life manga about Japanese schoolgirls. There are a good number of others, like Sunshine Sketch, Lucky Star, Sketchbook, GA, K-On!, Uraban!, etc. Writing my own <a href="http://www.neko-machi.com/" rel="nofollow">slice of life 4-panel webcomic</a>, I can tell you it's not easy, and I'm not surprised to see stuff like NieA_7 sometimes have trouble pulling it off.<br/><br/>[1]4-panel or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonkoma" rel="nofollow">yon-koma</a> manga is basically the Japanese version of newspaper comic strips. It's probably not a coincidence that the cover of <i>Families</i> has four pictures of characters arranged vertically. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazae-san" rel="nofollow">Sazae-san</a> was originally a 4-panel manga, and its anime adaptation is like the Japanese version of the Simpsons, if the Simpsons had run for 40+ years so far instead of 20+.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
