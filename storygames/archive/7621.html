The game has changed a bit, but I think it's still valid.<br/>When I wanted to do it, it had its roots in the tensions established by the initial oracle and brainstorming of characters phase. If your adding a new character, I imagibe you should keep in mind the relationships established already, and use it to enhance thwe stuff already in play, rather than creating an PC to take the action in a completely different direction. But that's probably obvious.<br/><br/>For question 3, I think this is a group decision based on the details of the fiction. Basically, anyone who wants to can join the conflict as long as they can describe how that happens without hitting any other player's "What? That makes NO SENSE AT ALL" buttons.<br/><br/>For question 1, I don't know how much authority the GM has tp push back or deny the player's requests. But everyone has the ability to add to a scene, and redefine the setting though those additions. I think again it's a group decision whether to veto or alter those additions - but even if it's the GM's, I would expect a some discussion and negotiation before anything is vetoed by anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169180/#Comment_169180" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T13:50:19+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  1:50PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2008 1:50PM by John_Harper.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) I take a heavy, heavy hand in scene framing.

In brainstorming mode, I can easily get 10-20 characters from 4 Oracle pulls without much trouble. That's not ever going to work in a chapter of a game.

We just talked things out.<br/><br/>I never really "changed parameters" per-se, because we all sort of agreed on them going in.

I ran the game with a basic version of PTA's scene framing rules, mostly because I was just dead tired, and it worked pretty well. I do have to say that I would prefer to frame them myself, though. That way I can still show off a little bit and control the pacing and mood of the story. Although if a player actually requests a scene or a moment, I almost always say yes, unless it simply wouldn't make sense. That is pretty fun too, because then I can go: "Well, what can I do to turn this scene on it's head?"<br/><br/>2. I usually never need to make a new NPC because I'm the one framing the scenes, heh. That way I can work in the original NPCs from the oracle. Also, that slight familiarity with those characters make their entrances a little more cool. I have created new NPCs during play, but I only bother statting them up when they are actually involved in a conflict. I think it's good to introduce a new character this way every now and then. This way the players never feel entirely "safe" with a un-statted NPC.<br/><br/>3. I always let the players decide if they want to be in the conflict. If they don't, hey that's fine....

We played in a game with an oracle that ended with: "...armed with stick and stone" Not only was the armed character a PC, but we also had two very memorable NPCs named Stick and Stone, who were obviously fighters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
