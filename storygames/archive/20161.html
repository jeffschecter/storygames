However, he hit upon a successful formula with old-school reciting very long lists of lineages.<br/>- Unable to get a decent horse, Sir Robert succeeded in his goal of obtaining a proper steed by stealing a giant hedgehog from King Arthur's private zoo. He then won every subsequent joust, so he may have been onto something. <br/>- The player knights discovered two kids in one overcoat trying to enter the street joust as an adult. They let them joust but forced them to pay separate entry fees. <br/>- Sir Goldplume tried to build a house but got a bit mixed up and built a boat. A perfectly seaworthy boat, but rather too far from the sea to be any use. <br/>- Sir Kelenor won numerous jousts by psyching out the opposition with his blinged-out horse, including at one point low-slung lanterns to create a colourful "under horse glow". <br/>- One of Sir Robert's goals was "marry a rich widow". He tried to meet one at a carnival but only attracted attention from rich married ladies, so his next move was invite all their husbands on a very dangerous dragon hunt. <br/> </div>\n<div
