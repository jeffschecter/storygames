I'm in the final editing phases, and I want to see if there's anything that I can add that I've forgotten.  Here's part of the opening blurb:<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk ten different people who play roleplaying games for their definition of the hobby and you'll get eleven different answers... and probably a big argument too. Some people will tell you its about the rules and the dice, other will say the story is the most important thing. I suggest that you need some of each to succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal for the Impulse RPG is to present a set of rules that are quick to use, easy to implement, and intuitive. A simple and abstract system is easy to teach to new players, easy to adapt to your style of game and desired game world, and can be played quickly over the Internet. It is my intent to create a structure without dogma or preconceptions, so that the group is free to bring their own desires for what consists of a roleplaying game to the table, and that they can enjoy portraying their characters and their interaction with the game environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules presented here are not new or revolutionary. This game isn't the next step forward in roleplaying theory. Not everyone will find what they are looking for in here. And let's face it, this book probably isn't going to cure cancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this sounds interesting to you at all, please let me know if you'd be willing to give a quick readthrough/critique/'add this'.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133736/#Comment_133736" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T10:50:19+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:50AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fire me up a copy.

Just what does your game do that others do not. "Light" RPGs abound, and the usual claim to fame is that they mostly get out of the way. If that's all yours claims to do, then it's going to have trouble getting anyone to use it over, say, RISUS. http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nOr the Window: http://www.mimgames.com/window/<br/>\n<br/>\nOr if it's more rulesy, one of the streamlined D&amp;D hacks out there. There are a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr FATE... I could go on and on. Why would you, or anyone else, use your game over these? If you can't answer that question, then my critique is probably going to be specifically that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133806/#Comment_133806" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T14:12:17+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  2:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Peter, have you playtested your game?

So forgive the volume of the comments, but I hope you find them useful. They are presented in my usual bullet point method, which is somewhat \u201cStream of Consciousness\u201d created as I read, modified after the fact. My biases are clearly present, but I think that\u2019s a good thing. Just read understanding that I\u2019m not trying to be unbiased (as if such a thing were possible). <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be several posts in a row. The first covers the early parts of chargen, outside of traits. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The first paragraph under "Creating a Character" is not about creating characters, but game set-up. I'd suggest either putting that in it's own section, like "Settnig Up the Game" or just omit it. There's no rules there, just some suggestions for a good way to set up play, and vague ones at that (what is this "premise" stuff about, anyway?). Practically speaking, given a game like this, the people using it are going to have their own ideas about how to set up a game. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - You indicate that the character concepts should fit into a "team" concept. Is this just out of tradition (this is what most people know how to run)? Or do you feel that your rules really need characters in a team? If so, why is that? Just to show my biases, I rarely run games this way. In my games, the PCs are usually at odds with each other, or, if they do become allies, do so organically to the action. Not saying my way is better, just that there are other options. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Many, perhaps most, RPG players are capable of writing up backgrounds like the example one you give. But some players are just unwilling to put forth that sort of effort for whatever reason. Does the game deal with this? Your example background looks like a BE lifepath. Is it your expectation that players will try to illuminate all periods of the character's life? <br/>\n<br/>\nIsn't there some value to leaving blocks unstated so that players can create background in play if they need to in order to make their character fit the action better? I'm personally against backgrounds myself, and all for creating characters in play so that they fit best the way the player wants them to fit to the action. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Interestingly your example background is missing several of the things you say a good one should have. It doesn't indicate a personality trait. It suggests possible relationships, but doesn't create even one (other than the relationship to the other PC). It doesn't say anything about his beliefs, though one might infer them from the character's one goal. It doesn't say if any of his chequered background is secret, or indicate consequences if it is discovered. It doesn't say anything about his passions (though, again, we might infer some things from his goal). And it does not include a physical description. Basically the example misses almost all of your bullets. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd posit that this is less because it's a bad background, and more because the bullets you have are actually not easy to come up with. Mechanical methods work better, in my experience. That is, if you want a player to come up with a personality trait, have a slot for it, and require that to be filled in with an entry before play begins. I'll cover this more with my comments about the Motive section below...<br/>\n<br/>\n - You put Motives at the end of the section. How is this different from "Goals" in the background? I mean, really, shouldn't the player be thinking about all of this up front? Why get to the end of the process, and THEN decide why his character who he has carefully designed, is "Adventuring?" <br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover... I'd posit that Adam's goal is plenty enough. That is, I don't buy, again, that you need to have any special rationales for "Adventure." First, just don't think of it as "adventures" and "Scenarios," and, instead, think in terms of the character's story. Does Frodo have a motive to go "Adventuring?" On the contrary, his story is all about having to go due to circumstance and his moral character. He absolutely does not want to be away from the Shire. Why does every character have to be so easy to motivate? It's actually not hard at all to get characters moving, *as long as you focus on the events being stuff that impacts the character*. As opposed to most RPG scenarios which are their own storyline into which we try to "Hook" the PCs. <br/>\n<br/>\nBlah. <br/>\n<br/>\n - The good part of Motive is that you clearly state that it is an indication of player intentions. Bravo. Up front, and with the background material... or even before, and universally applicable to all of character generation... I think this would be great advice. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also love that you note that motives are evolving things. Now, if you would give an example of how your system can be used (and it can, I think) to reflect those changing motives mechanically, I think you're on to something. Hint, Adam should have a traits that says "Stick it to the Syndicate," "Stick it to the Government" and "Make it as Ship Captain." <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are, in fact, his most important traits, and should mechanically drive all play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext...

Is this actually the only place that the GM has special power? What if a trait bugs another player? Do they have a say? You do indicate at one point that everyone has to generally approve. What if they don't? The GM has veto, but the other players do not? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - You indicate that the player should name his abilities with adjectives that speak to the magnitude of the ability. But, why? Isn't that what the rating is for? If I take "Tremendous Flying 6" and you take "Good Pilot 7"... what's the point of the adjectives? Or do the ratings speak only to story power, and not a real in-game magnitude? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Competency Ladder indicates a specifically in-game rating. Your examples in the Competency Ladder section are mixed... the high ones have adjectives that seem to match the ones in the Ladder, but the mediocre ability omits the fact that it's mediocre. More importantly regarding trait levels...<br/>\n<br/>\n - How fast is the sample character at running? He has fast hands, sure. But I assume that's not going to help in a footrace. Let's say Adam gets into a dash to reach the starship controls before the self-destruct goes off... What level of ability does he have there? You have the "amnesty" rule, but... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm hinting at is that the perspective the game gives on this seems odd to me. That is, like many games, it seems to assume that if you do not have a trait listed, you are "unskilled." But this only works with traits that are skills. What about "running?" Oh, sure, one can definitely become good at running, but can't everyone run? Doesn't everyone have Running 4? Average? I mean, isn't this the meaning of the term Average? That it\u2019s what you'd expect somebody to have if they aren't exceptionally good or bad at it? <br/>\n<br/>\nYour amnesty rule indicates that, once character generation is over, you've listed all of the character's abilities, and are to list no more... unless there's a good reason. But I'd posit that each character has a potentially infinite number of Average traits. If not otherwise listed, he's average strong, for instance. Average at math. To posit otherwise, to posit as say FATE does, that the starting level is below average, means that the character is deficient in the vast majority of things, as compared to the populace at large. Unless "Average" means something else here?<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically you're missing a "Default" level of ability. The \u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t have that trait\u201d section notwithstanding. What do I roll if there's no pertinent ability listed, but it's a task that pretty much anyone can do? Average, right? Or even Good, if we're playing James Bond? I don't advocate that the players put these abilities on their character sheets, either. Just to have a rating to go to when there isn't a pertinent one on the sheet. Also this is important because...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - This also means that any ability listed as less than Average may actually be a liability. Which is good, because this is your "flaw" system. Let's say I take "Running 3"... I'm basically saying my character is slower than others. This should be available. An incentive to take low-level abilities would be good, but at least having the option to have them should be there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Along with these comments about abilities... what if I wrote in my background that he's an excellent pilot... but just forgot to write it down? Amnesty says that I should only take it at four. What you really mean is that anything not indicated specifically in the background should be limited to default level of ability. Right? Not that I can't fix an error in character generation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm getting to is that I think that, sans a point system for buying traits or such, it makes more sense to me just to let the player take any ability at any level at any time. As long as it makes as much sense as it would have in chargen. Subject to exactly the same limitations. Why prevent a player from fully fleshing out the character in the way that best illuminates him? Abuse prevention? If that's your goal, then there are better ways. But its a truism that if you don't limit the player, that they'll self-limit. It's only when you set limits that players feel the need to push them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that you then DO set a limit... the "advancement" rules. In watching closely how people play Hero Quest, there is a phenomenon of people who simply chuck the "Advancement" rules. The problem they have with it is that it goes against the grain of the system that says that their keywords include all traits that the character "should" have. Basically Traits are free... but you have to buy them. It's contradictory. What might work best for your game is to allow players to take abilities at whatever level up to 4, whenever it makes sense. Not "Amnesty," just a player power that they can employ at any time, which supercedes the rule that says that a new ability starts at 1. Basically, if the player wants to say that their character is working out to become a faster runner, he should be able to list "Running 4" for free, and then spend Coins to go up from there. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Your example of splitting up gun fighting... sorry, but this hits another personal nerve. If, in a given game, the GM decides to make this split in breadth, he's saying to the characters that the game is to be about gun fighting. That is, you say "This game is going to have a lot of gun fighting." Why do we assume that? Rather, why do we assume that this is going to be the core of the action? Why wouldn't one ability cover this? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we were playing out Star Wars, would we really need to have Chewbacca's Rifle higher than Han's, and Han's pistol rating higher than Chewies? Isn't the key in characterizing these two, to give them both high gun skills, and then give Han "Bravado" and Chewbacca "Intimidating." It's not just Han's gun skill that allows him to chase a platoon of stormtrooopers down a corridor, it's his guts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not going to show up if players are focused on how many points they're going to put into "blaster Pistol" and "blaster rifle." You've taken a game system that does not have to have a specific combat focus on it (more on this later), and given an example of how to put that combat focus back on it. Agh. How about the example being splitting "Criminal Background" into "Infiltration" and "Deception"? Or something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Specials\u2026 why bother? No, really, why have these be any different than any other trait? \u201cRigidly defined ability that let\u2019s you do one thing\u201d? Flying as an example? How is flying functionally any different than running? Or shooting a gun, to use one of your examples? It is an ability that is used to resolve contests, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m not against your comments about including downsides to abilities that the general public does not have a default level for. Or discussing that odd abilities can be traits. But these should just be traits, and rated like any other, and used to resolve things like any other. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Super Abilities \u2013 this one is really, really complex. You take \u201cStrong 8\u201d and I take \u201cSuper-Strong 5\u201d and I\u2019m stronger than you? Yes, there are ways to deal with this, but it\u2019s very hard to get them across to folks. I\u2019ve tried. Incredibly hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Twinking out... if you limit characters after development as a creative constraint... why not limit players during chargen? I'm all for player freedom, sure, but I think a point limit on abilities would work well to create characters that are "balanced" in terms of them being not too much detail, and not too little. A point system does that well. No, it doesn't necessarily promote gamism if done well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext...

And, while I think that your ideas are right here, your method of getting them across seems a tad garbled. You're saying "Character vs Character" is not "Player vs Player." With all that implies. Not an easy subject. I don't have any specific advice on how to improve the section, however. Might be fine as is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -I like your \u201cTake 7\u201d for one side (usually NPC) method. Makes all contests have the same odds spread. Very nice solution. And I used to be against \u201cimpossible\u201d tasks\u2026 but I am no longer. They are rarely, or never, used to fiat against players. Instead what they do is highlight high abilities. \u201cOnly he could have pulled that off!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nResolution is very simple and clean. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Your \u201cIntent and Consequences\u201d is adequate, if not great. I am very interested that you decided to leave the consequences in the hands of the \u201cplayer.\u201d The way it reads, the player who is involved in the contest gets to decide what happens if their character fails? That sounds good in some ways, but I have a feeling that it might fall under the Czege Principle. Which is that Paul noted in writing a game called \u201cChalk Outlines\u201d that if you both create the contest and it\u2019s outcomes that it drains some (or all) of the drama from the contest. For some reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlaytest this with care. <br/>\n<br/>\nOdd that you include victory consequences here, then, asymmetrically. Basically everyone suggests stuff? The margin idea\u2026 the problem with this is that there\u2019s really no algorithm here, and certainly nothing mechanical about the outcome. You have this number generated by the system\u2026 nothing you can think of to do with that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso interesting that the GM has full control over the difficulty, then, including disallowing things (it would seem), if they seem to be adding on too many goals to a contest. Hmm. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - While I can only most wholeheartedly agree with your \u201cLet it Ride\u201d section, you\u2019ve abbreviated it in such a way that many readers may be left wondering about it. It has to answer the question, \u201cWhy can\u2019t my character try again?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Penumbra and \u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t have that trait.\u201d Really the same things, aren\u2019t they? One section on this might suffice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Stormtroopers. Again, I agree. But wouldn\u2019t this be better said that the difficulty of working against NPCs doesn\u2019t have to be some rating? Put another way, how about not giving NPCs any Traits at all? Just assigning difficulty on what a player can assume about traits? Such that NPCs can be seen as being no different than a rock to climb, for these intents and purposes? It\u2019s only by privileging NPCs as though they were PCs that we create a need to do this explanation at all. Just do away with that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Getting A Little Help \u2013 I like how you\u2019ve worked this, and that you don\u2019t allow for gear lists, instead making gear a situational modifier. I\u2019m all for that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like you intend for \u201cpenalties\u201d to be added to difficulty, and \u201cbonuses\u201d to be added to the player\u2019s roll. But then it talks about these canceling. Isn\u2019t that duplication? I hope that you go with the more elegant version. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just what are \u201cBonus dice\u201d? Did that slip in from an earlier version? <br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never have more than a +3\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019ll be exceptions.\u201d I paraphrase. I understand what you\u2019re saying, but it reads contradictorily. What you mean is, \u201csituational bonuses never add up to more than +3, but there are other modifiers later like teamwork.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - \u201cTeamwork\u201d this section implies that a player may \u201cTake 7\u201d. I didn\u2019t see that as an option anywhere else. Is it only here? <br/>\n<br/>\nI like how this works, and linked tests. Very smooth. Can a player helping do a linked test to see if they get a bonus to the teamwork roll? Or only the main character? I\u2019m thinking the latter, but it\u2019s not 100% clear in the text. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it\u2019s very odd that you focus on \u201cspecials\u201d with regards to linking tests. I\u2019m seeing more FORK here than anything, and that means knowledge skills, mostly. Again, I\u2019m not seeing what\u2019s so special about special abilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention \u201cScenes\u201d here. Without further definition, this could be problematic for some groups. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Combat\u2026 I\u2019ll shortcut this commentary by just saying that I think that the game would be vastly improved by simply deleting 2.4 from the text. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep \u201cwounds\u201d but make them just the mechanical outcome of any contest that is lost. If you like these mechanics, keep em, but change the verbage from \u201cCombat\u201d to \u201cExtended Contests.\u201d This way you don\u2019t have to have \u201csocial combat\u201d\u2026 it\u2019s all just \u201cresolution.\u201d <br/>\n<br/>\nSee Hero Quest or FATE. Note that BW gets a pass on this, because there are specific mechanics to Duel of Wits and Scripted Combat that make them internally interesting. You have no such mechanics that are unique to those sorts of conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext...

What a ridiculous name for a currency\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nUm\u2026 where was I? Oh , yes, uses:<br/>\nRerolls \u2013 Man, nothing more I hate than burning currency, and getting no effect out of it. That\u2019s not me saying that the random hand of fate can\u2019t tell me that I am not allowed to win. Just that if I spend currency, I want to know what it\u2019ll do. In Hero Quest, if I burn a Hero Point, it has X effect in bumping up the level of success. I may still not be able to win, but I know what I\u2019m buying for my expenditure. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about adding +2 after the roll, instead? Limited to one or two per roll? Matching the NPC bonus you have? Why make this an exception for NPCs? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what\u2019s with the Experience Points for bumping? This is a common mod for HQ, and, from what I\u2019ve seen of it, it ruins an otherwise great dynamic. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlot Elements \u2013 shades of FATE here. I\u2019ll say here what I\u2019ve said to Fred. If the GM has veto power, this is no different than if the player asks for something to be true. Basically you\u2019re saying that players may not even request things to be true of the GM, without spending a point. Sounds innocuous at first, but where do you draw the line? <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: is there a mug on the bar that I can hit him with? <br/>\nGM: you paying a Coin for there to be? <br/>\nNow, as a bargaining, too, perhaps. As a way for the GM to try to drain points out of the players\u2026 maybe. But I\u2019m too good at getting the GM to include my material anyhow as it is. I\u2019d never end up spending any points. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike: Man, I sure hope that there\u2019s no thugs down this alley that we might have to fight\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s all negotiation, and putting Coins in the middle of that negotiation up front seems all wrong to me\u2026 of course it would, though, wouldn\u2019t it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPower Stunts \u2013 \u201cpushing Specials\u201d \u2013 again, why are specials so special here. Let\u2019s say I want to use my guns skill to impress a lady with my shootin\u2019 ability. Why can\u2019t I pay one Coin to allow that? <br/>\n<br/>\nAcquiring Abilities: again, I\u2019d allow any ability for free at level 1 to 4. <br/>\n<br/>\nAvoiding Consequences: OK, now we\u2019re talking. Here\u2019s something concrete I can use the points for. That said\u2026 I think consequences are good for play, and, after all, you have the player making up the consequences. Is he going to make up a consequence, fail, and then decide he doesn\u2019t want that consequence after all? How about the GM makes up the consequence, and makes it bad (not so bad that the player hates his character if forced to accept it). Then the player has a real incentive to alter it. And it puts the suspense back in conflicts. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd\u2026 how about adding \u201cMitigation\u201d meaning that the player can spend a Coin to have gotten a concession (ala BW) from the target? <br/>\n<br/>\nEXP: Again\u2026 why? Why not use the currency directly? Force the player to decide between making his character cool now, or raising abilities later. Instead of giving him both. Gives the player something to think about, instead of making it a no-brainer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Getting Coins - <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting Coins should not be \u201croutine?\u201d Well, depends on what you mean. Psychologists will tell you that, in fact, positive reinforcement is most powerful when it is both random and frequent. That is, the player should not expect it, no. But they should have to do the good behaviors constantly, then, in order to maximize their rate of return. So opportunities should at least seem to be ever-present. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeroism: again, with consequences, I feel that it\u2019s more powerful if the player doesn\u2019t know what downside he\u2019s potentially incurring for his character. Let me be very clear, I don\u2019t think that discussing stakes before hand is a good idea. No, really. Yes, it\u2019s very important to understand the player\u2019s intent for a contest, so as not to disappoint in creation of the consequences. But that\u2019s not the same thing as saying that we have to have decided on them up front. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it\u2019s worth more of a reward to the player if they jump in blind. Makes these Coins seem all the more precious then. <br/>\n<br/>\nRoleplay: Eh\u2026good idea, but when facing this sort of thing, I rarely see it actually get used. We expect good roleplay, so how do we know when it\u2019s really exceptional? To make this bite, a good mechanical indicator would be good. Like whenever a player comes up with a linking test to a personality trait, and then takes the time to play it out, rather than just letting resolution move on. Something like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nFailure Amelioration: Not sure on this one. Can you explain the rationale more? What behavior does this promote? Acceptance of failure? That\u2019d be good. If it worked. <br/>\n<br/>\nComplications: now we\u2019re talking. Reward the player for hosing his own character. Excellent. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Adventure: Not sure what this is for? You figure that the players won\u2019t make enough on the above? Note, I don\u2019t have \u201cadventures\u201d in play, so I wouldn\u2019t know where to give these. For HQ (same problem) I give each session of play. But I don\u2019t like that, much, either. Having it all have to come from good play is, I think, the best. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext...

Found that, after a while, I just didn\u2019t use it. Like detailed encumbrance rules in some games, the level of complexity  involved just isn\u2019t worth the output. <br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, if at some point I want to have a contest regarding whether or not my magic is running out, because I\u2019ve used so much, the rules already give me a way to deal with that. I just roll a resolution. Yes, using the same trait rating. What, I\u2019ve used more up? Then the difficulty goes up. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Corruption Specials \u2013 Here are your \u201cFlaws\u201d or \u201cnegative traits.\u201d Your version works a lot like Stolze\u2019s Insanity Meters, in that a character becomes jaded. What\u2019s missing, however, are the minor breakdowns and freakouts along the way, and actual negative effects. That is, sometimes the player should have to roll against a difficulty equal to their corruption trait to act a certain way. Like to throw the ring into mount doom. Frodo misses this roll. Smeagol, already at corruption ten, uses that level to get the ring from poor Frodo, and saves the day accidentally. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like that a player can take on corruption voluntarily. I think that the minimum and maximum level stuff is unnecessary, however. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that all of this can be handled as an extension of the rules you have. Which is elegant. That should be true of whatever \u201cExtras\u201d you have. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Exotic Species, Magical Items, Super-Tech, etc.  \u2013 Again, just another trait, in my mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Mass combat \u2013 should be obvious from the regular rules, but it helps to point this out for the grognards in the audience. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Ships as NPC \u2013 again, don\u2019t think of NPCs as somehow different from rocks, and this becomes pretty obvious. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Dueling and Dogfighting \u2013 these seem tacked on. The extended resolution\u2026 I mean combat system\u2026 can handle them with aplomb, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Coin Trading \u2013 Unclear: does the player wanting to give the other player a Coin pay another Coin to the GM? Or does the GM just get one from the bank? Either way, it sounds pretty neat. Makes it possible for players to exchange Coins, but they aren\u2019t just a communal pool. Excellent. <br/>\n<br/>\n -  Hardcore Mode \u2013 stealing Ryan\u2019s \u201cDeath Flag\u201d idea, eh? Hmmm. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Collaborative Authoring\u2026 I thought you had to pay a Coin to add stuff. See\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n - Anti-Coins \u2013 if the GM has the same powers as the players, and the players can just add two per coin, then the GM can just add two to the difficulty. You\u2019d probably want to allow bidding to go on indefinitely here. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Flaws \u2013 this is already handled in the explanation of getting coins for complicating your character\u2019s life. You should just note there, that (as Rob and Fred would tell us) that \u201cdouble-edged\u201d traits are the best for this. You have one or two sections too many on this subject. Oh, and there should be no limit to this\u2026 the limit is already that the GM makes the award. <br/>\n<br/>\n  - Game Hacks \u2013 I won\u2019t say much about these, as they are not core. I do see the \u201cTake 7\u201d rule in there, however. The one thing I would say is that either a rule is core, or it\u2019s optional, don\u2019t make it \u201csorta optional.\u201d The base set should be tested as is, and work as designed, and include everything that works well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe optional rules really should be ones that change the way that the game plays. If a rule is optional to use, that doesn\u2019t mean that the question of whether or not it\u2019s an option should be unclear. That is, it\u2019s one thing to say that the GM never has to allow a take 7, but another thing to say not even to ask. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext...

But I\u2019ll boil it down to one. The whole section seems to be an apology that your game can\u2019t do what the players will want it to do. It also smacks of \u201cRule Zero\u201d where you say a lot of things like, \u201cRemember, your story is much more important than the rules. When in doubt, choose drama over dice.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s your intent, but text like that causes many readers to assume that GM fiat can over-rule anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, either. There is GM judgment in every RPG. What I\u2019m saying is that your system is pretty good, and you should stand by it by suggesting that players should follow it, including the places where it calls for judgment. <br/>\n<br/>\nJD will be along to tell you that it doesn\u2019t matter anyhow, they\u2019ll make whatever adjustments they will make. That\u2019s fine. Your job is just to show them one way that you\u2019ve tested that works, so that their modifications are based off as stable a system as you can provide.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext...

While I think you have a pretty tight system here (albeit one that I think you can tighten further, obviously), I'm not seeing anything that isn't already done pretty well by, say, FATE. By avoiding making the game about anything in particular, and in using a lot of techniques that we've seen around, you are making it so that people aren't going to be able to see any reason to play this over anything else. There are a couple of cool solutions to particular problems, and I think that some people might use them (I'm going to rip off one or two, I think). But I'm not seeing this system getting a lot of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if your intent is only to make a system for yourself that solves your own personal problems, then I think you've done great in all likelihood. Just not sure what your goals are for the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

It's going to take me a while to process and digest all of this, but there are some good points that you make.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bias I write with is to address problems that I've experienced in my games.  In case you weren't able to tell, they include my players creating a group of characters that have no reason to work together other than they're all wearing PC halos, characters with no backgrounds, and people who are being deliberately anti-social.  I've been burned on several occasions by such things.  If I just kept on looking for people that could play in the responsible manner that you seem to be describing, then I would be looking for a very long time, as I have yet to find any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134286/#Comment_134286" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T06:13:12+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  6:13AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, now that I have a little more time, let me address a couple of things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have long held the belief that rules cannot police the group.  This is my take on "Rule Zero".  I see how some of the things I included violate that premise, and I thank you for pointing those out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy decision to couple Coins (I had originally conceived the term "Yummies" but dismissed it as being too silly) with the advancement system was to discourage hoarding and to encourage the players to use them on moments of being cool.  When the player spends a Coin on a re-roll, he is saying "I care about this," and to me that an indicator of where the XP should go.  Again, I'm basing this choice on my own experiences.  Maybe we're coming from different backgrounds here. <br/>\n<br/>\nRealistically, I know that I'm competing against FATE, Savage Worlds, and other generic games out there.  I'm not expecting to replace them. <br/>\n<br/>\n My original intent was to tighten up The Window system into something more approachable, that made more sense mathematically to me, and had better explanation for complex situations.   And yes, I did try to splice in bits and pieces that I thought were particularly clever.  What I'd like to think I have is a distillation of some of the more popular tropes of story games into something that a relatively inexperienced player can understand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134316/#Comment_134316" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T08:09:37+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  8:09AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yummies... lol<br/>\n<br/>\nSavage Worlds has Bennies... so...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your point is that there is a social contract that exists around play, I totally agree. And you fall back on that, when the rules do not cover what you want. But, and this is an ideal, the rules should cover as much as possible, so as to facilitate play. Or at least enough so that the fallback on social contract doesn't make the rules feel as if they're... ephemeral. Or conditional. <br/>\n<br/>\nResponsibility... that's a loaded term. I also hear people use "maturity" a lot. A lot of times in response to ideas like I'm putting out above. I think that, most times, these are actually scapegoats. If/when these are actually the problems, as you say, the rules cannot handle this. There has to be a social contract that means that everyone playing is comfortable with everyone else playing, and how they're interacting on the real, human, level. If not, no game system is going to fix that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what's interesting is that in most cases I firmly believe that the problem isn't on the social level, but instead it's a system problem. Basically the system isn't compelling enough in a fun way to get players to do what you're wanting them to do. Do you really find your players to be "irresponsible?" Isn't it more true that the systems you're using are encouraging only the behaviors that you're seeing? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, having the character have a rationale for why he's in a "party." Well, first, this is why I think that parties are bunk. Largely there is no good rationale for them. Oh, sure, we can start out with one mission, and say, "Everybody is off to kill the giants for the Duke." But then what happens after the giants are dead? <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it's actually possible to create very strong reasons for characters to stay around with each other. They're actually employed by the Duke, Knights with oaths of fealty to him, and all loyal to the end. But, even then, this has two problems:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The characters aren't identical, or even if they are, they are different instances. They aren't all going to go on a date with one girl. They'e going to have their own girlfriends. If you want to play out any of that, eventually you're going to have to "split the party" anyhow. <br/>\n2. Why limit players to having to have these concepts anyhow? <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically there's another entire option of how to run RPGs that drops the "party" concept entirely. I won't go into it now, because you may be familiar with it, and it's extensive to talk about. But if you want to talk about it, direct me to another thread, and we'll go. What I will say about this alternate method is that it requires no more "responsibility" on anyone's part to run well, and has none of the pitfals that people think it will have. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless the players actually demand a "party" structure, the alternate method of play is strictly superior. In fact, I'd say that since they can choose to "party up" anyhow, having the option is always strictly superior. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to ensure that players incorporate background and characterization into play, then incentivize it. I'd argue that you already have, in terms of the Coin rewards, but I'm guessing that you're figuring that your players will not respond well enough to it. If you want to more strongly support this, then go ahead and hard-code it into play. For instance, at the beginning of a scene, the GM can frame the scene, and then may pay a Coin to declare a "flashback" for one PC. That player must then describe some event from his history that informs how the character is going to respond to the scene you've set. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, writing that a player "should" write a background is basically no incentive at all. The GM can call it a violation of play, I suppose, not to follow this rule, and refuse to start play until he has backgrounds from all players. But why not make writing the background fun mechanically? Give them some incentive? And, again, if you do it during play, they can do it in little chunks, and ones that allow them to mold the character on an ongoing basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact... how about if the player doing the flashback can declare a new (or replacement) conviction, based on what happened in the flashback. Sorry to keep riffing on my own modifications. But you see the sort of direction that I'm going. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany times "anti-social" play is either facilitated by, or caused by, players who think that they aren't responsible for their character's actions due to the system informing them that they are allowed to "just play my guy." There are simple systematic methods to fix this perception. For instance, you can give the other players the ability to award Coins. Perhaps on some limited basis (this is "Fan Mail" from the game PTA). If you make all of your rewards come from the other players, in fact, then the player is strongly informed that his goal as player is to please the other players, through the tool of his character. As opposed to just having "my guy" do what "my guy" would. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there is an unstated social contract clause that says that we're all here to entertain each other. But there's no reason that the system can't reinforce that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of Coin hoarding... do you think that players would rather let their characters fail than save the coins for advancement? Every time? Because, in fact, what I'd want such a system to do is, to, in fact, give the player a good reason to say no. I WANT my players to sometimes look at the dice and say, "Know what? I'm going to let my character fail this time. Bucause THAT is cooler in this case than him winning." <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there isn't something else to spend em on later, like advancement, then the player has no decision to make other than, "Hmm... maybe next roll is more important, should I save them?" What's really bad is if players just spend them on every roll, perfunctorily till they run out, and can't any more. Give them a reason not to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for spending being an indicator... If I spend to save the girl, because I really want my character to save the girl, and I get a level of swordplay out of it... how is my expenditure indicating what I think is important. Yes, spending is a flag. But it's a flag that points to what the character is succeeding at, not what ability he's using. If then later I want to point out that I'm interested in having more navigation contests, I'll spend a point on that to raise it up, and then the GM is informed that Navigation is the trait that I'm interested in coming into play. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way you have it, I can't do that sort of pointing. I have to mix up my character goal indications with my character ability interest indications. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how HQ works. Bump up success now? Or choose to fail, and spend the points later on advancement? This tension works well. Note that players always say to me something like, "Man, I'll never save em, I'll always bump." Or, "Man, I'll never bump, I'll always save em to advance." But in play, they always split. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the goal of making the game more approachable to non-Story Gamers (despite incorporating Story Games stuff), I have three comments:<br/>\n1. I'm probably too close to have a really valid opinion, being a Story Gamer myself, but...<br/>\n2. I think that Story Games are already very easily approached. And...<br/>\n3. I'm not seeing your text as being more approachable than either the Window or Story Engine. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that you want the game to be sorta agnostic, but then you have the "playing" chapter that pretty much does as much "preaching" as the Window does. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem with the Window is that it has methods that they say make good play... but then it does nothing to support these methods mechanically. Telling people "You should play this way!" doesn't work. You have to give them rules that make it fun to play that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134317/#Comment_134317" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T08:12:33+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  8:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Put more simply, you can continue to blame every player you come across for being a bad player.
