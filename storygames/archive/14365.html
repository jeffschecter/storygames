OTOH I'm pretty allergic to drifts some other players/GMs have tried that directly touch BW's resolution mechanisms -- like I have a GM who likes to make up MOS benefits on the fly, and it seriously cheeses me off because it feels like it's interfering with my stated intent.<br><br>* Sometimes we had someone besides Gwendolyn hand out missions in MG. Just an appropriate-at-the-moment call. Didn't seem like a big deal.<br><br>* Played around with the static-giving procedure in Lacuna, stuff like making the players think they'd logged out but then giving them static while they were "awake" as a cue that they were, in fact, still in the dreamscape. That whole game is about having fun dicking around with the players so this just seemed like one more way to mess with them.<br><br>* We hacked the hell out of the company rules in Reign because fuck if we could make it work as advertised. Never worked, total failure, interest just sort of petered out after that.<br><br>Most of our drifts I think arise from the current GM being intuitively dissatisfied about some aspect of resolution (range of possible outcomes feels goofy or boring), or on occasion because something makes total sense inside the narrative but a bit of guidance feels arbitrarily restrictive (Gwendolyn hands out missions) and not like an interesting creative constraint (ie most of the MC moves in AW).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326347/#Comment_326347" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T12:48:45+00:00" title="May 25, 2011 12:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So just to be clear, for purposes of this thread, you're defining "drifting" to mean changing a game's written rules in any way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326348/#Comment_326348" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T12:49:13+00:00" title="May 25, 2011 12:49PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We drift Burning Wheel slightly.

But also it's because I am <i>really, really cheap</i> and won't buy a game unless I believe it's well-designed.  Furthermore, I won't even <i>play</i> a game unless there's something reliable or otherwise appealing about the design.

I admire your extensive list of caveats; I try to do something similar whenever I post to RPG.Net, which is rarely.

The new table has a risk of downside, a soft middle of "no bonus, but no penalty," and a chance to get really nice bonuses even bigger than the original table if you roll well. Thus, more incentive to roll for the Augment, even if there is a risk of a penalty instead of a bonus.<br/><br/>I ripped the Edge column out because I have yet to find any mention of how or when you roll for the Edges to become more effective during a contest. I like the Edges, I see a lot of potential with them....

That's because I'm often playing it with people who don't yet get fan mail.<br/><br/>I also collapse screen presence changes into arcs over a single session, and make explicit "protagonist," "secondary characters," and "antagonist" PCs.

It just didn't flow as well as the first act for my group.<br/>-D&amp;D is totally an indie game shut up! I've been trying to put all editions of D&amp;D along with all hacks and deviations into a blender to extract only the condensed basics that would fit the way of how I naturally drift D&amp;D anyway, so I'd have rules that actually help instead of getting in the way of my drifting.<br/>-I'll be making Seize by Force a peripheral move next time we play AW.<br/>-I very much drift the setting of Mouse Guard with my group. They don't dig mice all that much.<br/>-Our most recent game is a procedural freeform. We didn't set anything down except the most vague guidelines, deciding we'd drift and shape and rule-ify and give it structure as we go along. Oddly enough we haven't had to drift or change anything so far, the initial assumptions have proven to hold true in play.<br/><br/>And that's all that comes to my mind now regarding this subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326442/#Comment_326442" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T06:08:32+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  6:08AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like we do this pretty regularly.

Hmmm...<br/><br/>Well, I'll just keep going anyway. I think this one is more drifty, anyway.<br/><br/>In the <i>Hero Wars</i> rules, you can roll a character's abilities one of two ways: You can roll a d20 against your ability's value to see if you succeed in opposition to another character rolling a d20 against his ability. The relative results of success or failure are then compared on a table to see how the conflict turned out. (Complete Victory, Marginal Victory, Total Defeat and so on.)<br/><br/>Or you can just roll the d20 against the ability as unopposed as a skill check.<br/><br/>In my cheat sheet write-up of the rules, I'm ripping that unopposed skill check right out. We'll only have opposed, conflict resolution in play.<br/><br/><br/>So, basically in <i>Hero Wars</i>, I'm looking at this really efficient conflict resolution system with an in credibly flexible Ability character description mechanic ready to soak up any situation-rich setting ("Hates Lunar Empire" is as valuable an Ability as "Loves Wife"), where the mechanics detailing how a character plugs into his or her <i>community</i> are far more detailed than anything to do with how many gold pieces the character has, that encourages the use of adding fictional detail of character's behavior in conflict through the use of a bonus mechanic....<br/><br/>And there are these passages in the rules that have this strange feeling of being present because of vestigial memory of game design that are there because, well, "That's how you make an RPG!"<br/><br/>For example, there are rules for handling different qualities of armor and weapons. It's implied they are optional, sort of. They're there because, I think, someone along in development said, "But what about the difference between a dagger and a short sword!!!" But they're quite fiddly, with little pay off. The game I want to play is focused on the passion and nature and colorful qualities of the <i>characters</i>, not the gear. So I'm ripping them out as well.<br/><br/>In short, I'm culling all the things that get in the way of making play focused on the compelling characters and their behaviors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326446/#Comment_326446" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T07:23:50+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  7:23AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Playing un-drifted PTA is like playing Monopoly straight - people talk about it but nobody does it.</blockquote>\nYes!

Maybe more, I've lost track! Unfortunately, 80% of these games are 1 shots in 4 hours or less. And it's not uncommon for me to run for people who have no or minimal RPG experience. So over the years I've drifted Dogs quite a bit\u2026<br/><br/><b>1. NPCs.</b> Instead of statting up NPCs, I use the NPC array dice option from Afriad (Vincent's never published horror hack of Dogs). It's faster and allows me to improv more making the game feel more player driven.<br/><br/><b>2. Escalate.</b> Another rule I took from Afraid, the first person to Escalate to a new conflict arena ignores the current attack (you don't have to block or take the blow) and makes an attack of their own. I never ever considered changing Escalate on my own till I played Afraid and then I found I could never go back. The few times I tried the old way, it felt anticlimactic that when one person Escalate to get more dice, the other person could then Escalate to also get more dice (assuming they are comfortable going there in the fiction). It felt like a zero sum game. With the Afraid rule\u2026 Escalation was a moment everyone at the table jumped out of their seats for! The tension it brought was high\u2026 you want to be the first to Escalate but you also want to wait for an attack that's worth Escalating for\u2026 just fantastic! <br/><br/><b>3. Giving.</b> When a PC gives up in a conflict, they keep their 2 highest dice (like NPCs do) and don't have to immediately use them but can save them for a future conflict where the fiction feels relevant. I found when PCs just kept 1 die, they rarely gave in. But 2 dice was just enough of a tipping point that it made PC lose willingly, which was major fun in the fiction. We changed it so that you can save these dice for later because often it felt right in the fiction and also made giving up more appealing. <br/><br/><b>4. Traits.</b> You can save any or all your Trait dice to be assigned in play (liek Relationships). Made character creation faster and the Traits players chose in play felt more true to their characters. <br/><br/><b>5. Relationships.</b> Instead of making Relationships that may never be incorporated in a 1 shot, you choose Relationships from a list of NPCs in the town you are about to play ensuring your Relationships are immediately relevant with minimal effort. Additionally, 2 of your Relationships must be shared with other players. My enemy may be your best friend. When you define the Relationship\u2026 I give you full authorship. You can define it in any way\u2026 make the NPC who I thought was a good guy into a bad guy\u2026 anything! <br/><br/><b>6. Help.</b> Players often feel frustrated that when a conflict starts, they can't interfere even when there is no reason in the fiction they couldn't. So I allow outside PCs to help by rolling a relevant Trait, Relationship, or Belonging and giving the highest rolled die to anyone in the conflict. But you can't use those dice in your next conflict. <br/><br/><b>7. First Aid Conflicts.</b> I used to use them but in a 4 hour game where we only really have 3 hours to play, it took too much time. So I removed dying from Fallout and replaced it with higher Fallout consequences. But although this makes play faster, it also means that it is almost impossible to die from a non-gun wound (say from a weapon wound). I need to refine this to bring back the original lethality of the game without the slowness. <br/><br/><b>8. Short Term Fallout.</b> I've added options like, "you\u2019re alone and in trouble" to encourage PCs to break apart since in Dogs, the Dogs united mainly means they will win every conflict but more importantly I've found solo scenes to be narratively exciting, revealing, and encouraging of independent thought rather than defaulting to group think. I've also experimented with, "if you're wrong, admit it and apologize", "if you've sinned, confess and repent", and "make a promise you don't want to make."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326452/#Comment_326452" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T07:59:59+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  7:59AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Chris">@Chris</a> K: your desired focus in <i>Hero Wars</i> reflects just how awesome social conflict is, in that game.

They don't seem like extraneous froo-froo to me. But I was planning on using them in a specific way, and you've named for me why I'm intrigued with using them. <br/><br/>Such items will be unique and named: named swords with history, gifts from the gods, forged by community and so on. Each would have a place within the community or the history of he character's journey. The would be bequeathed, or hard won, or forged specifically for a character for a specific quest or action in play. <br/><br/>This means one might not end up being worthy of the gift by the community's standards -- and the standards might be higher because the character possess this amazing thing. The character, wearing or wielding this sword or ring, might be expected to be an exemplar member of the community. If he fails to carry that responsibility well, some might try to take it from him. There might be tension because one family is getting glory from the use of the item over another, and so on. Societal and communal tradition and tension will be a vital part of any items of this type. <br/><br/>Thus, although the item gives a mechanical bonus in combat, it also is tied always into the societal and social conflicts.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I'm thinking there will be a combat Edge, but also a social Edge: "I am Hrathgar, wielder of Bayrol," and yet get a bump because of the prestige of carrying that sword.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326466/#Comment_326466" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T10:08:41+00:00" title="May 26, 2011 10:08AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><b>Which games?</b><br/>Marshall, I kind of dig that adjustment you made to ranged in<i>Sorcerer</i>.</blockquote>\nThanks! I just realized that I didn't go into the "why" at all like I'm supposed to, so lemme get to that. As far as I can tell, Sorcerer is about trying to use power responsibly, but the problem is that the powers (synonymous with the demons) are by nature irrevocably irresponsible. The "Ranged" ability just seemed, well, flat, in that context. It's the only one that doesn't have consequences and things-you-have-to-take-responsibility-for. It's kindof a freebie, y'know? I mean, I know that to some point it's not because it means 1 more Lore point on the demon which has all kinds of consequences by itself, but the actual <i>use</i> of it doesn't have any bite to it. So I changed it to try to fix that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326478/#Comment_326478" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T10:44:14+00:00" title="May 26, 2011 10:44AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2011 10:47AM by jdfristrom.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Seattle-Story-Games way to play Shock: is issues first (written down so you don't poison each other), then come up with a Shock that engages with all of them.

This may be the same as a previous edition, but 1.2 does it in the other order.<br/><br/>And I like to require the protagonists to link with each other, or share links. That's J. A. C. Newman approved ... on another thread somewhere.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, and why:<br/><br/>issues -&gt; shock creates weird salads, "We never would have come up with this alone"  Good craziness. Generation ships return to earth with mood enhancement tech. Nanoviruses are used to determine ones standing in society. Bizarre polygamous alien family cultures.<br/><br/>links -&gt; ties the players together more, makes it feel less like "three simultaneous stories" and more like "one story with an ensemble cast"<br/><br/>There are a *lot* of places in the Shock: rules where rules like your second one are allowed. It says things like, "player x decides" but doesn't tell x *how* to decide. That's deliberate for exactly the reasons that Jamie is giving: sometimes you want a particular effect, other times you want a different effect. If I'm playing hardcore 80s cyberpunk, I have to think very carefully if I want to put people as Links at all. I'm alienated and misanthropic by nature. It's the opposite if I'm playing an Ursula K. LeGuin story, where everything is about complex interpersonal sociosexual relationships.<br/><br/>If I recall, the first rule is listed at the back of the book, too.<br/><br/>I'm starting a new project soon that will show all of the "hard points" in Shock: where you can attach new gadgets and how to make those gadgets interface with the rest of the system and each other. On the other hand, there are some rules that, if you change them, it will really fuxx0r the system, and I'd like to know if anyone messes with them and gets effects outside my experience:\n<ul>\n<li>Antagonist credits \u2014 I've found that adding as little as one Credit makes Protagonists helpless and leaves Antagonists with no good strategic choices to make. Removing one makes things way too easy for Protags.<br/></li>\n<li>Increasing the number of Features a Protag has by one means that they very likely will win their initial Intent, which means they won't get another Feature, which means they don't get to use their Links as much. Decreasing it would mean they're practically guaranteed to fail in their first scene \u2014\xa0it would be better to just guarantee a failure.</li>\n<li>A larger number of Praxes is absurdly confusing and eliminates choice. A smaller number (2) gives you *very* flat story, leaving players to either shoehorn their actions into inappropriate Praxes or keep doing the same things over and over.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326702/#Comment_326702" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-27T13:25:10+00:00" title="May 27, 2011  1:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><br/>#3: This was a response to a complaint people had about how it was hard and confusing to resolve multiple conflicts at once.

Exhaustion and Madness are contagious. And when a PC recovers a Madness response, I let them choose either Fight or Flight, regardless of what it originally was. I use poker chips for that, green for flight, red for fight, and it works really well.<br/><br/>In <i>D&amp;D3e</i> (and 3.5) when a PC was raised from the dead they only lost the XP it took to reach that level (i.e. dying when you were 2nd level always cost 1000 XP, not resetting you to halfway to 2nd). I hated how otherwise PCs who were close to leveling up were penalized more harshly, especially since it's pretty common to have the big battle near level breaks.

I love me some 3:16 and I'm interested to hear what you do with it.<br/><br/>Sure. We do a bunch or reflavouring, like Combat Drugs is calling the Emporer's Name, Ranks is prestige not actually a ranking and reflavouring the weapons. We also drop on some class types like Assault Troopers starting with a chainsword a pistol and a one use per planet jumppack (move to any range), Devastator starting with Heavy Bolter and can re-roll kills once per planet. Apocathary healing once per planet etc.<br/><br/>I realized I forgot to say why. We do it because we have played an bunch of 40k games (Rogue Trader etc), but we'd rather explore this issue of war with a faster resolution system. Plus I recall reading this is what Gregor made 3:16 to do, so we feel like we are dropping in the last details he couldn't because of IP restrictions.<br/><br/>I also do a couple of changes to make it easier to play, like:<br/>- a list of how you can use NFA including a cover rule like what I imagine 316 AD will have because I find new players struggle with NFA.<br/>- a limit of two strengths per planet for one shot games.<br/><br/>I've got a doc around somewhere with all this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14365/drifting-indie-games-do-you-do-it-how-why" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14365/drifting-indie-games-do-you-do-it-how-why" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14365/drifting-indie-games-do-you-do-it-how-why/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14365%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14365%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
