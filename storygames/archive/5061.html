Do you retain your own ways and face the consequences?  Adopt the interloper's traditions?  Perform the new religion on the surface while maintaining your ways under the surface of syncretism?<br/>\n<br/>\nChiefdom is handed down from oldest son to oldest son, and all marriage is exogamous (with the wife moving in with the husband's family, and no marriage within the same tribe).  The chief has three daughters, no sons, and will not be able to bear any more children.  Which tradition do you break?  Bring the eldest daughter's husband into the chief's house, breaking the exogamy rule?  Is the daughter the chief, or do you let a son of another tribe become your chief?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt'd be a game about making tough choices about adapting/preserving cultural tradition in the face of extraordinary circumstances, and then playing out the results of those choices in the strife it causes in the community.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer characters would be individual leaders within the community (Tribal chief, shaman and war leader; mayor, sheriff and preacher, etc.).  Community creation would be collaborative and occur first, then players would select appropriate leaders from that community and make their individual characters, so that each conflict is situated and contextualized through the experience of the individual characters rather than being abstract and impersonal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm halfway through a novel right now, so I can't give this idea all my attention, but I wanted to get some things down and maybe solicit some feedback.  Who knows how much of a commercial appeal this game would have, but why let that be a limiting factor?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114095/#Comment_114095" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T10:47:15+00:00" title="December 13, 2007 10:47AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MRUnderwood</cite>Who knows how much of a commercial appeal this game would have, but why let that be a limiting factor?</blockquote>Precisely.<br><br>I like the idea of collaboration for tribal conflict. I've seen this mirrored in sim-heavy setups, but I think a numberless traits-trump-traits cultural merger formula, with additional coins which could be spent to cling to one's heritage, would, if not a game in the traditional sense, be a fun, engaging anthropological exercise.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
