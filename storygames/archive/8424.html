The game lasted two hours, which is right on target for some experienced players (only Clinton hadn't played before, and he caught on immediately).  I saw an unusual tie that I need to account for in the rules, but otherwise the current draft is pretty solid.  One interesting thing about this session was that we all chose less action-oriented elements, which made the game more introspective and relationship-focused.  Nobody died.  There was one fist-fight off screen.  It was a pretty mellow love traingle, with some hippie eco-terrorism overlaid on it.  <br/><br/>The setting was McMurdo station, in Antarctica, which everybody was really jazzed about.  It's a solid play set, but because of the insular location, I think the relationships tend toward less physicality and more emotional interplay.  I'm OK with that.<br/><br/>We had:<br/><br/>Dr. "Murph" Winkel, the Earth Sciences boss, who started out as a nice guy with serious concerns about environmental problems on the Ice and turned into a real power-hungry bastard after the tilt.  <br/><br/>Dr. Andrew Ward, Deputy Director for Infrastructure and Logistics, a career bureaucrat being blackmailed by Murph and having an affair with Dr. Jones.  Joel played this guy with some sympathy, which was remarkable.  He was sort of sad, but also evil - a minion of the petroleum industry.<br/><br/>Rusty Jones, a PhD candidate, kitchenhelper, and part-time postal worker.  Also an eco-radical and environmental extemist burning to "teach the corporate tools a lesson" - he spoke for the trees, or, in the absence of trees, the penguins.  Olivia's ex-husband, and still in love with her.<br/><br/>Dr. Olivia Jones, a geologist and Rusty's ex-husband.  having an affair with the Deputy Director.  Working for Conoco-Phillips to do some "research" involving petroleum deposits in the dry valleys.  <br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fiasco/mcmurdo_map.jpg"/><br/><br/>Oliva Jones and the Deputy Director had been in a horrific accident where two other guys had died, illegally drilling a test well in the dry valleys.  Murph and Rusty wanted to get to the bottom of that, and Murph had some racy snapshots of the (married) Deputy in flagrante delicto with Rusty's ex-wife.  There was blackmail, jealous rage, a misfired murder attempt, jockeying for power, and a lot of sex.  After the tilt, we discovered that Murph wanted the Deputy Director 's job and wasn't as big a green activist as he let on - and Olivia fell in love with him (awkward!).  When Rusty clumsily resorted to "direct action" with some explosives, Murph ratted him out and played the hero, getting him busted and betraying the cause.  The game ended with Rusty in jail, Murph confirmed as the new Deputy in Washington, Olivia under his thumb, and Dr. Ward retiring with his wife and kids.  <br/><br/>So not a lot <i>happened</i>, on a physical level - it was an interior drama, very soap opera-ish, not as huge a clusterfuck as is typical, with the action resolving to focus on Murph and Olivia.  This is one of the things I love about Fiasco - you can look at the web of relationships, but you never know who will be central, and who will be supporting, until things start to move.<br/><br/>Oh!  Also of note - there was only one NPC - a mouth-breathing radical named Ivan who was basically a foil for Rusty.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186667/#Comment_186667" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T15:05:46+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  3:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game is on my radar, and my radar is calibrated to only detect incoming awesome.<br/><br/>I don't know the specifics of the game, really.

And then ye shall know the TRUTH.<br/><br/>One interesting part of this game and the R-map that it naturally develops, is that you don't create a character per se. You develop the relationships between your character and the characters to your left and right pre-play. And as those relationships develop you get a sense of what your character is like.<br/><br/>So your first scenes leave you a lot of room to maneuver as far as the specifics of how you want to portray your character, but you always have some concrete things to hang your hat on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186678/#Comment_186678" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T15:57:32+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  3:57PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Fiasco.

Graham, Scott Base is just down the road if you'd rather pretend to be from New Zealand (apparently they have a pool table and the best bar on the continent.)<br/><br/>The weird thing, for me, is that you're basically picking eight items from a cluster of 144, and yet it all hangs together with some consistency from game to game.  I'm not precisely sure why that is, but I think it has a little to do with the act of reviewing all the items -the ones left unpicked become a garden of inspirational ideas.  I think the scanning and choosing is an important part of play and one of the reasons it works with zero prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186721/#Comment_186721" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T19:04:43+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  7:04PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 7:05PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and to back Chris up, the only things present at the beginning of the game are the blue and green items in the diagram above - you pick those, and interpret them as a group to make the black ones (characters).
