Ordinarily this is all about escaping the dullness of everyday life, having a fictional action-adventure.<br/><br/>There are so many of them, in all canals; TV, movies, games ... all over the place. The action-adventure is a dominant cultural phenomenon. And I am part of it. As a professional GM I lead rpgs on a daily basis, giving action-adventures to young players, entertaining them that way. <br/><br/>My situation is that the action-adventure bore me. It is too shallow. There are hardly any emotions to it. No real exploration of the human condition. <br/><br/>I feel a growing need to escape the action adventure. I do that by initiating games focused on everyday life, modern games and classical ones, as often as possible. My greatest joy in gaming comes from these forages into "dullness" nowadays. Only thing is; these games are far from dull. They are ripe with nuances, human drama, emotions, relationships ... the rich realities of the human condition. They are everything but dull. Ordinary humans are everything but dull. I love to walk the shoes of another ordinary human being, in a true role-playing game.<br/><br/>So, my question is; do YOU understand what I am talking about? Do you share some of these sentiments? Please respond in earnest.

But I'm not very fond of the idea that we all seek the opposites of our lives in the fictions we explore. To me it sounds like the "balance" of a dualism free from ethics. I do not seek such a state. I find it quite interesting enough to seek truth, beauty and goodness, using these classical virtues as my ethical compass, in both life and fiction. Even when my fictions grows dark, I try to find the beauty in them, some kind of enlightening truth, and a spark of hope to follow; the good will that delivers a soul from crisis. <br/><br/>But this is only me rambling on! No need to listen to an old man going on about classical virtues. They are hopelessly out of date, of course. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397887/#Comment_397887" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T17:21:26+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  5:21PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on whether the play revolves around, to some degree, any sort of problematic cultural issues the GM thinks he sees.

Wish fulfillment especially. Being that badass dude I could never be, GMing lots of games where I encourage players to do the same. Now that I'm getting closer to the perfect formula, ridding myself of the stupid boardgame conventions, I'm convinced I'll never tire of it.<br/><br/>BUT I also love games that are 'real'. I love games about (mostly) real people, about real issues. When we can have a game that's actually about racism rather than fantastic racism. When the theme is something easily recognizable in your own life and not veiled in fantastic metaphors. And it doesn't have to be dull, because even if it's the ordinary world, if it's a well thought out, it should still be an interesting situation. Perhaps ordinary, but not everyday. The most intense roleplaying experiences I've had was because the game refused to be about anything not real. Because it punched me in the gut with love and tragedy of the kind real people feel.<br/><br/>BUT I also love when games mix the fantastic and real passion. When there's a thick ooze of substance crawling up under the awesome, unrealistic stuff. A dreamy world that's still perfectly clear about what it's about.<br/><br/>So, I guess I'm not entirely what you are talking about. Are you saying games should have 'real' substance? Or that only realistic games can have substance? I don't agree with the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397893/#Comment_397893" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T17:38:05+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  5:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That, <a href="/forums/profile/Vegedus">@Vegedus</a>, is what I was getting out of "true roleplaying game."

Nothing really comes as a surprise for me setting-wise (I'm still surprised by game styles sometimes). Therefore I'm open to play almost any setting. It really doesn't matter what I play - it's the experience I feel when I play that's important.<br/><br/>A buddy of mine introduced <b>Psychodrame</b> on a gaming convention. French social realism in a contemporary environment. It felt dull, just by the pitch. And then he continued with giving an example of a scene, where a person could just sit and sigh for a couple of minutes. Seemed really boring, but I'm always open for new things.<br/><br/>And the game blew my mind.<br/><br/>Sure, the game is about dysfunctional people so that's a little different, but for a guy who played high-paced action games the last couple of years ... it felt like I was being reborn. The slow pace, the game mechanism, the ordinary problem, the scenes where nothing happens on the outside but explodes in the inside - all that created a really cool sensation. I discovered a new way of playing games. I still like high-paced action games, but now I can flip between that and a really down to earth kind of games with "real" humans.<br/><br/>Last time we played, we played While the World Ends. It's normally takes place in a Sci-Fi setting, but we changed that into a New Years Eve party 2014 with a bunch of old friends coming together for one last party. It was about New Years vows, friendship, drunkenness, betrayal and loneliness.

We got all these tonal shifts between, f'r'instance, spending half an hour with someone roleplaying getting drunk and bombing out with a girl he liked, or a kid dealing with family problems, or a raid in the middle of a war zone, or blowing up a 30k person spaceship, or even blowing up a sun.  It meant when we had to make big decisions, or we failed at something, or even if we succeeded but with consequences, it really <i>meant</i> something to us, both to the characters and the players.<br/><br/>I've played in and run games that were <i>just</i> about interpersonal relationships and emotional nuance and found them very rewarding, but also not enough that that's all I want to do from now on.  It's great for texture and emotional buy in and that, but putting in an action story or mystery, or some other kind of external framework like a shared project or event that people are involved with, helps a lot in terms of giving your game a skeleton.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397917/#Comment_397917" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T20:41:18+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  8:41PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafael">@Rafael</a> 's thoughts mimic my own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397933/#Comment_397933" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T00:23:08+00:00" title="November 18, 2012 12:23AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>w176; I see what you're aiming at; people seeking some balance.

It's essentially like it's the boring bits, waiting to lead me towards something that I actually find interesting.<br/><br/>If a game doesn't include a sense of adventure juxtaposed with examples of everyday life, <del>then it isn't true role playing, because I can't get into my role otherwise</del> then I'm way less into it.<br/><br/>That said, I'm really curious to hear about what exactly you're talking about.  I'm reading about it as "scenes where we focused on day to day activities" which have, in my experience, generally been "scenes where a GM (who may or may not be me) is stalling."  I'm pretty interested to see how a scene that is two minutes of a player sighing is actually fun -- I really am, that sounds interesting.<br/><br/>To sum up -- I'm pretty sure I don't get it.  What are you talking about?

Before the next scene you roll a die; to determine who has died. then you play a similar scene, with him as the dead one. He is allowed to play on, as memories talking to the others, while they drink and talk. And then you roll for death again ... etc.<br/><br/>There is no GM. You play these old friends, burying one friend at a time, talking about old times. And then at the end, there is a special scene, all of them young and happy, once, and that scene brings it all together.<br/><br/>It is a simple little game, deeply moving, thought provoking. <br/><br/>But I'm not surprised that you have failed to see such scenes weave a spell for you in classical games. If you want to experience things like this, you have to make games to cater for it. It's like; if you want something to read like Hamsun, a porn-magazine won't do the trick. ;-)<br/><br/>David_Berg: I've played all kinds of action-adventures. I've enjoyed most of them. I don't enjoy them as much any more. So I try to find other themes for my games.

Does the GM or another player do anything to encourage this?  Just curious.</blockquote>\nNot usually, though that would an interesting way to do it. I've played a couple of scenario where a specific narration where capped off by hearing a piece of music in it's entirety, with no talking.<br/><br/>But no, it's more like it's an random moment of silence that gets protracted. A silent agreement that we've already built up the atmosphere, let's savor it a bit. As Rickard says, it's about build-up, about feeling the weight of the things that have happened so far. If the game is about atmosphere, it's likely to happen, but isn't really something you plan. Which is why the maxim is directed at the GM, the point be he/she should recognize such moments and not cut them short, because we're trained to cut scenes when "nothing's happening". And you can totally be in-character without saying anything. One of my friends have this example were he was at a larp where he apparently spent hours looking into a grey wall and it was a fantastic experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398015/#Comment_398015" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T16:53:21+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  4:53PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'll try to answer you, Terwox.</blockquote>\nYou succeeded!

I find it very interesting both to explore and renew the fantasy-tropes. But going modern, with no GM, is better done in contemporary settings.

Because you seem pretty fascinated with the fact that pretending to be a boring person for 15 minutes made you feel bored...<br/><br/>(Seriously, that dulling of the senses and tapping of energy sounds like normal boredom to me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus" title="Vegedus"><img alt="Vegedus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/895/n84VMHBHNTJ6O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus">Vegedus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398121/#Comment_398121" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T16:15:18+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  4:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ultimately, anything can be fun if you're roleplaying it. There's a sheer satisfaction to simply being in-character, that us story gamers might sometimes forget about. Ask any larper, who spend most of their time cooking, making quilt or chatting in-character while waiting for the plot to find them. Maybe it's immersion, depending on who you ask.<br/><br/>Like, (ugh, another anecdote?) there's a volunteer cleaning crew at one of the cons I attend. They spend the entire con cleaning up barf and unclogging toilets. Most of them haven't played any roleplaying games at the con for years. But they're having a great time of it because they spend the entire time in-character as macho "Dirtbusters", talking about fighting chaos, acting with military disciplines, wearing funny costumes and listening to metal. The cleaning itself is part of the game.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Like, in this game I have made you play a bunch of friends. They have been friends since childhood. Now they are old. The game start with them burying one of them. You play the scene where they share a beer, after the service, talking about him. Before the next scene you roll a die; to determine who has died. then you play a similar scene, with him as the dead one. He is allowed to play on, as memories talking to the others, while they drink and talk. And then you roll for death again ... etc.</blockquote>Heh.  I wrote a game a bit like that once - everybody in the game was playing an 'alternate reality' version of themselves such that they all knew each other.  We picked the person in the group who had the most real life ties to everyone else to roleplay someone who had recently died and was present as a ghost, and everyone else was at their wake, telling stories about them - you could tell any story you liked, true or made up.  It had a really nice feeling to it.  Write up is <a href="http://gametime.livejournal.com/83313.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, if you're interested.<br/></blockquote>\nCool write-up, but a couple of phrasing jumped out at me, sorry if I'm being nitpicky: Isn't <i>"but they all had different creative goals that they could push for in the course of the game"</i> and "<i>You have this person, but can you keep them?  Do you want to?  What about your mates' relationship?"</i> conflicts? Or is it more that the games wasn't centered around conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398127/#Comment_398127" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T17:13:21+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  5:13PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I enjoyed reading that. Could you say that instead of basing a scenario on one (or several) conflict(s), you instead present a topic to gather around?</blockquote>Yeah, that's a fair description.  (And thanks for the kind comments, people.)<br/><br/>Interestingly, someone wrote a similar game to the birthday party game, but everyone was 11ish and going to the Scouts for the first time, and I got to play in that one.  And sure, there were personality conflicts and that, but the bit I really really liked was getting obsessive about painting peoples' fingernails, and playing bulrush, and running around in the dark playing an idiot.  Which is it's own kind of escapism, I guess. \n<blockquote>Or is it more that the games wasn't centered around conflict?</blockquote>It's more that the games weren't centered around conflict.  The story threads like some characters' marriage being in trouble - it wasn't really that there was a win condition, or they <i>had</i> to bring it into the game, it's that it was there underlying their characters and providing context, and they were playing to find out how the difficulty resolved itself over the course of this other activity.  The different creative goals - everybody could put their own thing into the story without having to deprecate someone else's.  Kind of like when you're writing with someone else and you keep on throwing the Idea Ball back and forth between you, and it keeps on getting bigger and sparklier?  (That was the intent, anyway.)<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_398154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398154/#Comment_398154" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T23:26:54+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 11:26PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A comment on why certain games work, in spite of being free of systems ...<br/>- they work due to having strong methods. <br/><br/>The method of play for most modern larps and rpgs is based on dialogue-techniques rather than mechanics. The multitude of dialogue-techniques which are available to a designer is virtually endless, and designed in the right way they really lift interaction to a new level. I believe the main reason is that they, more of less consciously, tap into the great skills of dialogue most people actually have, and do that in a more efficient way than classical role-playing games do.<br/><br/>Humans are masters of verbal interaction and improvisation. We do it every day, in every single conversation we participate in. No wonder games which tap into the jamming souls of humans feels great!\n<blockquote><blockquote>Well ... here is the interesting thing; even the most boring person may be interesting to play, ...</blockquote>\nSee, this has nothing to do with escapism to me. I'm playing a boring person in a boring scene focusing on how bored, unimaginative and dull I am ALL THE FRIGGING TIME. </blockquote>You should do something about your real life then! ;-)<br/><br/>FigureFour; most players are like you. As said; I have found that FOR ME escapism from the dominance of action-adventures in popular culture is what I need. There are so many narratives centering around violence, brutality and war ... and I've had my fill. So have a lot of other people. But the entertainment industry rolls on, as unfeeling and hard to steer as a First World War tanks!\n<blockquote>(Seriously, that dulling of the senses and tapping of energy sounds like normal boredom to me.)</blockquote>Thank you! So nice of you to say that! It was exactly what I aimed for in the game, so your comment has underlined that I really achieved my goal. Huzzah!<br/><br/>15 minutes of exploration of particular conditions like this, is what role-playing poetries are meant to facilitate. It is interesting how effective this can be done, and how great the impact can be on the players. 15 minutes is not a very long time, and still; deep dullness was achieved! <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398180/#Comment_398180" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T07:29:52+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  7:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand the boredom factor. I played miniatures wargames for many years and then hit a point where it wasn't interesting anymore. One side would attack, the other would defend. The attack would either break through or be thrown back. It was a dance that could take three or four hours to play - or longer with very slow rules. When I got to the point where I could look at the scenario and tell you where the game would end many hours later, the dance became pointless. <br/><br/>Games set about mundane things is one way out of the blind ally. The trouble with it is getting people who are not as jaded to want to play it. <br/><br/>Sounds like you are making some interesting developments to try and bridge that interest gap. I think there are system answers. Matrix games work well for these kinds of game but I still like scenarios that have more action than not. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_398352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398352/#Comment_398352" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T15:33:22+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  3:33PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ja, it is sometimes a challenge to convince people to play games that are designed to focus on the beauty of life.
