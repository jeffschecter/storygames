Feel free to advise me.<br/><br/>* Playable by two players. If possible, expandable to one or two more.<br/>* Something pretty freeform. Few/no resolution mechanics. Perhaps this is a bad idea, but I feel like I'd like it to be closer to the collaborative writing end of things.<br/>* At the same time, I'd like helpful tools to structure the kind of story that evolves. For example, the way Archipelago or Intrepid help you to create an oracle at the start that sets expectations for the world. Or the way Apocalypse World gets the GM to explicitly make some things questions to resolve through play - setting stakes. Structures at that kind of level, that give us tools to negotiate and decide some things, instead of just having to write fiction unaided.<br/>* Ideally I'd like a system that can handle short stories, of a few tens of posts, as well as longer stories. But two systems is also fine.<br/><br/>Any ideas? By the way, I did search the forum for answers, but the things I could find were mostly from 5 - 10 years ago, so I thought it was time for a new thread.<br/><br/>I'm open to "ordinary" story games. But I'm more interested in things that are more specifically geared to play by email (PBEM) and play by post.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454215/#Comment_454215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T22:49:57+00:00" title="June 25, 2016 10:49PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting set of criteria!<br/><br/>I think <i>Fiasco</i> could work well (although that's not great for two players, you could each take on two characters and I think it would work fine).<br/><br/><i>Gun Thief</i> could be a good game for your purposes. It normally requires three players, but I think it could work just fine for two.<br/><br/><a href="https://writingames.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Over here</a>, Eero and a friend/colleague played <i>S/Lay/w/Me</i> by post, and it seems to have been quite successful.

It's a freebie (well PWYW, but I put it there for distribution purposes more than profit.)<br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180407/Rewind-Temporal-Tales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180407/Rewind-Temporal-Tales</a><br/><br/>It's actually on my to-do list to play as a 'public' play-by-forum game.  It's intended for solo or lone wolf/GM play, but you can take a stab at a two player game as well.  I have written some design thoughts on that as well.  [Yes, I know there's that whole 'shilling your own game thing', but dang it, this is exactly the kind of scenario that I wrote this game for.]  :-)<br/><br/>[edit for typo]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454229/#Comment_454229" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T07:08:24+00:00" title="June 26, 2016  7:08AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Profundis_%28role-playing_game%29" rel="nofollow">De Profundis</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454261/#Comment_454261" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T05:14:56+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  5:14AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would Storium work for you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454264/#Comment_454264" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T07:10:22+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  7:10AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am investigating these suggestions and I'll get back to you all...
