I discovered the game via the Burning Wheel forums, where someone had linked to this forum, where someone had linked to the beta rule set. That's a lot of digging to get my game on!<br/><br/>I was pretty much sold on the premise alone - who doesn't love pulp sci-fi action? - and my two other players (and my girlfriend, who's not in my regular BW group) were eager to try it out.<br/><br/>The story we wound up telling was hilarious, ridiculous, somewhat juvenile (Dick Tower and the Circumcision Observation Deck), and a hell of a lot of fun. I'd write up the full story and post it to the Vignettes section, but I don't really have the energy to do that. Instead, I'm more interested in talking about the mechanics of the game, some questions I have, and some suggestions that we all tossed around. I mean, it is a beta ruleset after all, and I'm a big fan of getting down and dirty with a new gaming system.<br/><br/>So, first, I again want to emphasize that I loved the crap out of this game! So did my players. We bought into it completely and really ran with it. The rules themselves were flexible enough to allow me to get away with just about anything for the sake of story, and I wound up saying "Yes" to a lot of stuff that players wanted. Now, on to the meat!<br/><br/><b>Questions:</b><br/><br/>1. The text of the rules state that players can lobby for 1 - 3 Danger dice, and they may receive up to 2 more (1 from another player and 1 from the GM) in addition. However, on the rules summary sheet (page 25), those numbers are reversed: the player can get 2 Danger dice and the players and GM can give up to 3 extra. Which one is correct?<br/><br/>2. During an Interlude, you may optionally reduce your Danger Level by 5 and heal all the hit boxes in highest section of the danger meter where you have harm. Are these two things necessarily coupled? As in, do I only heal up if I reduce my Danger level by 5? Do you heal the damage before or after reducing the Danger Level?<br/><br/>3. When your Danger meter reaches a certain level, you get to roll multiple trait dice. Does this mean you get to roll the same trait die multiple times, or do you pick two different trait dice which sound appropriate?<br/><br/>4. The Alien style says that it's the "make your own" style. I figured that this means you get to make up your own Style Power to fill out that blank box, but I wanted to be sure: is that the case? Or does the Alien style just get to pick another Style's power (or some such thing)? If you make up the power, what kinds of things are considered to be within the scope of a power?<br/><br/><b>Feedback/Suggestions</b><br/><br/>1. I found the text for both Interludes and Suspense scenes to be extremely sparse. I mean, obviously, it's a game in development, so I figured it wouldn't be complete. What I'd like to suggest is to give some strong guidelines to make Interludes and Suspense scenes distinct from Action scenes and from each other. <br/><br/>One player suggested instituting a hard mechanic for Interludes, to make them work exactly like the "Previously On..." segment; each player takes a turn and narrates a little scene that is intended to set up a question to be investigated. Make sure it is expressly stated that you are 1. setting up a question and 2. you are looking to investigate it in the next scene. <br/><br/>Make sure that the questions asked relate somehow to the action that they just saw; this also allows a new possible use for the "Hint" option when a player gets a perfect roll - that is, if during an Action scene a player gets a perfect roll, they get a bonus die to their subsequent investigation of a related question during the Suspense scene. This creates for a very strong continuity in storytelling between the Action and the subsequent investigation, and I think that sort of momentum will keep the episode rolling through its cycles.<br/><br/>I think that's what's implied in the Interlude segment, but again, the text is sparse and there aren't really any examples of how Interludes are intended to work. Spelling it out expressly would be of great help.<br/><br/>2. As I said, the text for Suspense scenes is sparse, and it's a bit unclear. Are the Questions in Suspense scenes intended to work exactly the same way as Threats do in an Action scene? That is, do Questions move around, take Danger moves if they're ignored, and all that jazz? Can you take damage during a Suspense scene? What would constitute a Disaster in a Suspense scene?<br/><br/>I think it may be wise to create a separate, but similar, set of mechanics to the Action scene for Suspense scenes. Perhaps different Threat levels and a different list of Threat moves for Suspense scenes. That would serve to make the Suspense scene a discrete phase in the players' minds. <br/><br/>I could see maybe three levels of difficulty for a Question: Elementary (T1), That's a Tough One (T2), The $64,000 Question (T3). As a result, that means a Question can't result in Disaster; that should be reserved for Action scenes, to represent the incredible danger in having to actually fight. I would also do 1 - 2 hits for a T1, 3 - 4 for a T2, and 5 - 6 for a T3. Why fewer? Because players are often split up during an investigation, so they can't necessarily bring the full resources to bear to fight a question.<br/><br/>As per normal, rolling Danger generates a Threat move.<br/><br/>I'd revise the Threat table to look something like this:<br/>1 - Do a Reduced hit (appropriate to an investigation)<br/>2 - Spawn a threat for later<br/>3 - Do a Full hit (appropriate to an investigation)<br/>4 - There's a Threat RIGHT THE HELL NOW! (move right into an Action scene)<br/><br/>So as the players investigate questions, they might attract unwanted attention, or they might find something going on right the hell now! Once those Action scenes are complete, we can move back to Interludes, and then back to investigating new Questions or to cleaning up ones we didn't finish from earlier. Questions don't get more complicated as they remain unanswered; they really serve as a vehicle to wrap up previous plot elements and to introduce new ones.<br/><br/>Throwing players into individual Action scenes is also a great place to introduce movement and countdown threats. Radio to your buddies that you need backup? They need to fight a "Get There in Time" threat. Maybe combine that with a Countdown threat on the part of the baddie that started the whole thing. Intense!<br/><br/>As with Interludes, I think something like this is implied by the text, but I think spelling it out would be helpful. I also like the idea of treating the Suspense scene differently than the Action scene; it's a little bit more dangerous, and also a little bit more subtle, than an Action scene. That serves to 1) make the Suspense scene stand out and 2) get the ball rolling for the next Action scene. Having some harsh danger dropped on your face makes for some great Action!<br/><br/>3. The Help rules could use some clarification. It seems to me that it's almost always mechanically better to just do your own thing, unless there's some kind of Resistance on a Threat. Perhaps instead of making a roll all by yourself, you can give one of your Trait dice to the active player, to represent your assisting in the roll. That way, you can do low-stakes helping without the risk of adding lots of additional Threats.<br/><br/>4. Examples! Pretty much every section can benefit from examples, but the Interludes and Suspense scenes definitely could use examples. Maybe a full play log of one complete cycle, broken down to its basic mechanics. It's a lot to add, but I think it'd be very useful!<br/><br/>5. This suggestion is maybe a little sweeping, but what the hell. Maybe it's just because I'm a scientist, and thus think in a very "building blocks" sort of way, but I'd like to see the rules organized by separating the major elements of the game into their own chapters and explaining them individually. Then, you can have the sections about how they go together.<br/><br/>So, for example, you could explain the character sheets. Then, you can have the chapter on Traits and Rolling, where you explain how you pick an action, how you get bonus dice, and what constitutes success and failure. The next chapter could be Threats, where you explicitly spell out threat levels, how hits are used to defeat threats, and threat moves. The next chapter could be Danger, which covers the Danger meter, injury, and recovery. Then you can explain Traits and Powers. Finally, you explain how to put it all together.<br/><br/>By presenting all of the individual components first, you give the GM and the players the basic tools they need to put together stories. Give them the power to wing it first, rather than start right off with all the structure of the game. This will help everyone really <i>get</i> how the mechanics guide the type of story they're trying to tell.<br/><br/><b>Thoughts and Observations</b><br/><br/>That's the major feedback that I can remember right now. I'm introducing more people to this game - because I love it - so I'm sure there will be more to come. I really really love this game a whole lot; the core mechanics are rock solid and really inform the type of story you're telling. I especially like the Danger meter mechanic; as you push your luck, you get to do even bigger things, but the risks become even greater. That helps the whole system escalate to crazy action.<br/><br/>I like the absence of "advancement" mechanics. It prevents anyone from becoming an uber-hero and de facto forces a team-based approach. I mean, what the heck are you going to do with a d4 Professor? Not a heck of a lot, let me tell you that much! Better have a brainiac in your party! It also makes the heroes vulnerable, which really makes for a much more interesting story.<br/><br/>I thought about adding a new kind of Danger escalation: <b>Super Dangerous!</b> When a player wants to do something <i>particularly</i> dangerous and ill-advised, they can add <b>both</b> a d10 <b>and</b> a d4 to the roll. That means their dangerous thing is very likely to help AND very likely to hurt! Or maybe the GM could reserve Super Dangerous as a threat maneuver; put a d4 on a threat instead of a d6. Just a thought to amp up the action.<br/><br/>One of my players thought of other ways to "change" the characters over time. Maybe instead of adding a new Role or Style, you add a new Power or Talent. Maybe you get another couple of [+]'s. Add a damage box somewhere. Small, subtle changes that can reflect narrative developments in the character. Having a good list of ideas like that would be pretty neat.<br/><br/>Also, a list of pulpy nouns and names would be cool. Things like "positronic ray blaster" and stuff like that, for those times when you're just stuck and can't come up with anything cool to describe.<br/><br/>Again, this game is really freakin' cool. Excellent job! I look forward to seeing how it will develop. And maybe I'll actually find the motivation to write up our vignettes!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306689/#Comment_306689" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T14:28:12+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  2:28PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Peter,<br/><br/>Sounds like you and your group had a great time.  I'm not surprised - Danger Patrol has not let me down once.<br/><br/>I've run Danger Patrol about ten times so I thought I'd jump in with my opinions; I'm just going to say what's worked for me rather than give you what's "official," but hey, it's a beta.  I'm actually hoping Mr. Harper is too busy working on Danger Patrol Gamma to get to your questions.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>1) I used the text of the rules for the first couple times I ran it and it worked fine, but I soon went into a more flexible mode, tending towards the rules summary so that multiple players could add danger details.  I don't think you can do this wrong.  I suspect only the five danger die limit is important.  I'd usually go last and only add more danger if I could think of something especially cool.  <br/><br/>2) The danger meter decrement and hit box heals are coupled.  That or you get bonus dice.  That's from John.  You're healing the highest hit boxes where you have harm.  Where the danger meter is when you do that is irrelevant so the order is irrelevant.<br/><br/>3) I read it as whatever trait die you're rolling.  Rolling from two or more different traits hadn't occurred to me as a possible interpretation.<br/><br/>4) I've only had someone pick Alien twice.  One time they just took the Psychic's powers.  Another time they asked for something unique and I said no problem.  In that case they wanted to be able to fly travel from planet to planet without a vehicle.  You have the make a similar determination with the Mystic's powers.  You probably can't go far wrong with some deliberation and comparing with the other existing powers. <br/><br/>You've some cool/interesting ideas in the rest of your feedback.<br/><br/>If you search the Danger Patrol topics you'll find a lot of discussion about the Suspense scenes in particular. It's definitely a grey area and I'll be curious to see what John comes up with in his next iteration.  For myself, I've never moved a Question around, but I definitely have them make Moves if ignored and by default, you can absolutely take a form of "damage" (increasing the Danger and/or suffering hits) during Suspense scenes.  I found that it didn't always make sense narratively to "escalate" Questions or to have them spawn new Questions.  Sometimes I would have them spawn future Threats and in some cases I would just set some escalation dice aside to make the Threats in the following action scene more dangerous. Example: Dr. Nemo's investigations of Admiral Tea get back to him and he prepares his goons with better equipment in the next scene - maybe some disintegrator sabres.)<br/><br/>I've never had a Disaster make sense to me during a Suspense scene and have always split high Danger into multiple smaller Threats.  I would often describe reduced hits as a nagging sense of uncertainty about the way the situation was unraveling.<br/><br/>Something I did with Suspense Scenes the last two times I ran Danger Patrol was to have one more Question than the number of heroes so they could decide which ones they wanted to tackle and which one they would necessarily have to ignore.  Then I'd secretly roll 2d6/2 (round down) to see how many Hits each of the Questions could take (so they've most often be 3 hit Normal Questions with occasional major Questions).  If they had an Agent, Detective, or Professor trying to solve a Question in their wheelhouse I'd tell them exactly how many hits the Question had prior to their roll.  Then each hero would have a scene and have exactly one crack (roll) at taking out the mystery posed by the question.  We'd frame the scene, do some role-play, they'd make their one roll and then we'd figure out the results of the remainder of the scene based on their roll.  If they rolled all successes they got some good info on the Question they were planning to ignore.  This worked pretty well for me.  They'd typically answer the question but there was a chance they wouldn't answer it completely and it would remain open for future surprises/reveals from me in the next scene.  This kept the scenes relatively short and felt reasonably satisfying. <br/><br/>I've only used Danger Patrol for one-shots, often with one or more new players.  I always want to get an Action/Suspense/final Action arc over the session so that means the Suspense scenes have to be short for me.<br/><br/>I agree with you on the helping rules needing something.  It would be cool to be able to do some pulpy X-men Danger Room teamwork actions where you can chain some stuff together and have that reflected by the mechanics.<br/><br/>John has a ton of feedback on the game from every angle.  It wouldn't surprise me for Gamma if he busts the game apart and rebuilds it from the ground up.  It will also not surprise me if I love it.  I loved even the Fate-inspired pre-Alpha Danger Patrol.<br/><br/>I have a reference list of names and science-y words I use when running Danger Patrol.  I'll try to dig it up for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306703/#Comment_306703" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T17:32:12+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  5:32PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Peter!<br/><br/>First, your post is fantastic and I REALLY appreciate all the feedback.

What if everyone could only add one danger die to a given roll? That does take a bit of the narrative power away from the active player, but it provides a way to get every player involved in crafting the story even when it's not their turn. That could help them to come up with something on their own turn. I may give that a whirl. It also provides a sort of limit to the rate of danger accumulation; smaller games won't explode quite as much as larger games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark" title="TheWhaleShark"><img alt="TheWhaleShark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark">TheWhaleShark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308891/#Comment_308891" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T20:43:56+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  8:43PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A question for those who are playing and running Danger Patrol:<br/><br/>Can the Danger Patrol elect <i>not</i> to mitigate a Disaster?<br/><br/>Common sense tells me that the buy-in to a game of Danger Patrol means that you would almost always want to mitigate a Disaster.

We had a great time, but I did run into a weird quirk where early on the players were eager to take on Danger dice, with the psychic flyboy taking on a great deal of bonus danger from his fellow players, but as the action rose to a crescendo, they took on less and less danger dice.  I mitigated this trend a little by spending the danger to escalate the threats, so that even if the players took no danger on themselves there were danger dice to roll.

I once used a Countdown Threat combined with the Staged Threat (defeat A to get to B to get to C), and that gave the whole scene an incredible sense of urgency. Robot Stalin, who was piloting <i>The Red Meance</i> in orbit around Mars, was a Countdown Threat, and there were two threat layers in front of him: the Robot Nazis (a puppet army created by Robot Stalin himself),  and the <i>The Red Menace</i> itself (which had resistance linked to a space snowstorm).<br/><br/>Basically, Robot Stalin would count down while the Robot Nazis would keep the Danger Patrol occupied. The result is that the players took as much danger as they could, every single time, in order to get to Stalin before he hit 0. It worked beautifully.<br/><br/>There was also a space T-Rex and intergalactic wendigo at some point.<br/><br/>But yes, the Countdown and Staged threat combo is a great way to force players to make things more dangerous. I've also hacked the danger dice rules a tiny bit: the active player may lobby for two dice, the other players may add two of their own, and I <i>always</i> add one of my own. This way, if a player decides they want to turtle up and play conservatively, the other players at the table can sort of veto him.<br/><br/>I'm also a big fan of physical interaction to emphasize the urgency of a scene. I make a production of picking up two danger dice and solidly plunking them down right in front of the active player. I lean over the table and get up in their face: "How dangerous do you want to get?" I'll pick up the other danger dice and make the other players fight over them by keeping them just slightly out of reach. I'll even get confrontational sometimes: "Only 3 danger dice? Pussy. I guess we know who the <i>real</i> heroes are." Little tricks like that keep the players heavily engaged in the game. You have to make them <i>want</i> those danger dice.<br/><br/>I also like to have about twice as many threats as there are Danger Patrol members. This basically ensures that I will get to make threat moves if they decide to be conservative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309003/#Comment_309003" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T18:25:30+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  6:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TheWhaleShark</cite><br/>I'm also a big fan of physical interaction to emphasize the urgency of a scene.

I'm eager to see how much they'll want to crank up the danger going into the next action scene, with so much danger already in place.  I want to see that as well as use some more abstract threats.  <br/><br/>One think I was wondering about was the psychic's telekinesis?
