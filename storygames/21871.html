Later I'll talk about the "softer" or subtler methodological things I do to make 5E work for me.<br/><br/>The house rules have evolved over time, but the set I have now is definitely one I'd use in the future. There are four categories: (1) XP (2) Inspiration (3) Resting (4) Stat Generation. I'll detail them below.<br/><br/>(I also wrote an abstract wealth / Resources system \xe0 la Burning Wheel for that White Plume Mountain / Against the Giants game of 5E, but that was out of necessity to that particular set of adventures, and isn't something I feel the need to do all the time. Basically, what happened is that my players and I all agreed that we didn't want to have to deal with the huge amount of arithmetic involved in those particular adventures.)<br/><br/>(1) XP.<br/><br/>During sessions, gain 1 XP by:<br/>Spending Inspiration<br/>Failing A Roll<br/>\t(Exception: characters with multiple attacks in a round only gain XP for their attacks if they miss with all of them)<br/><br/>At end of session, gain 1 XP by:<br/>Resolving and changing a BIFT<br/>Discovering an interesting new fact about the setting<br/>Acquiring a significant treasure<br/>Forming a significant alliance<br/>Making a powerful enemy who remains at large<br/><br/>Special End of Session Award: If the party overcomes a significant combat challenge, put XP into the pool equal to the difference between the party\u2019s level and the CR of the most powerful monster defeated, with a minimum of 1 XP earned.<br/><br/>Each end of session award can only be earned once per session (Exception: each PC may resolve and change a BIFT). All XP goes into a pool, and the group levels up together when they reach the needed threshold of experience points. The XP total then resets to 0, unless there is a surplus, in which case the remainder stays in the pool. The party may level up during a Rest of any duration. (See the Resting rules, below.)<br/><br/>The actual chart of XP requirements can be found on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V_DSQaViV82KZ5pTow4qeaio850VhqYqCWURt1hC0EQ/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Google Doc</a> that this is all taken from.

Players should award each other Inspiration based on noticing when someone is making a dramatic choice based on their BIFTs. No player may ask for Inspiration for their actions in the moment, though if someone feels their contributions aren\u2019t being noticed, they are encouraged to bring it up at the end of the session or privately with the GM.<br/><br/>Players can write a new BIFT for their character every time proficiency improves (so at 5th level, 9th level, etc.). This is not mandatory, and the new BIFT can be of any category. (To balance this out, it\u2019s recommended to only start the game with one Trait per character, instead of two.)<br/><br/>If someone would earn Inspiration, but already has it, they can choose another player to give the Inspiration to. (This is actually RAW, but rarely followed.)<br/><br/>You can spend Inspiration to impose Disadvantage on any enemy\u2019s d20 roll instead of granting Advantage to your own d20 roll. (5E has very few ways to "nerf" enemy saves, which can make spellcasters or other characters dependent on enemies failing saves easily feel useless, so I introduced this rule.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478144/#Comment_478144" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-26T14:07:00+00:00" title="November 26, 2018  2:07PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (3) Resting.<br/><br/>Short Rests: 5/30/60 minutes, max 3 in a 24-hour period, function as per RAW<br/><br/>Medium Rests: 8 hours; recover 1 level of exhaustion, and either 1 Hit Die OR 1 spell slot of the highest level you can cast (you may split up this slot among multiple lower-level slots if desired, e.g., two 2nd-level slots are recovered on a Medium rest instead of a single 4th-level slot); otherwise functions as a Short Rest (but does not count against Short Rest limit)<br/><br/>Long Rests: 24 hours; recover half your HD, rounded up, but no HP (but can spend HD at beginning or end of Long Rests as desired); otherwise function as per RAW                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478145/#Comment_478145" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-26T14:12:57+00:00" title="November 26, 2018  2:12PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (4) Stat Generation<br/><br/>Standard point buy, BUT everyone also gets two "floating" points to distribute at the end. The rule is that any one stat cannot receive more than two bonus points from either the character's species or these "floating" points.<br/><br/>So, for example, a High Elf gets +2 Dex, +1 Int. A player could put one of their two floaters into Int, but would have to put the second one into Str, Con, Wis, or Cha. They cannot put any floaters into Dex, since it already receives a +2.<br/><br/>Another example: a Mountain Dwarf gets +2 Str, +2 Con. Floaters have to go into other stats than those.<br/><br/>The purpose of this rule is to solve the problem of "suboptimal" race / class combos. Paul might not like this one, as it actually encourages the party of Kenku Paladin + Tabaxi Wizard + Gnome Barbarian + Dragonborn Rogue sort of nonsense. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> But personally I find it annoying that the game officially allows any race / class combo, while heavily punishing people who choose one of the many "wrong" ones. (Basically, the game's math assumes you will start with a +3 in your main stat, but if you do Point Buy without these floaters, and you take a race that doesn't get a bonus in your main stat, you get stuck at a +2. Not fatal, but annoying as hell.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478146/#Comment_478146" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-26T14:21:05+00:00" title="November 26, 2018  2:21PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Methodology:<br/><br/>-Make failure matter \u2014 since you're handing out XP for every failed roll, you'd better make sure that the dice rolls mean something<br/><br/>-Play to find out what happens \u2014 this axiom is a clich\xe9 at this point, but it really matters. My players in my 5E games have genuinely surprised me in how they've chosen to approach certain NPCs, and many encounters have not gone the ways I would have guessed. It's especially important not to worry if they curbstomp some combats! That's the game working as intended! To allow for this style of play, without drowning in prep, it is necessary to...<br/><br/>-Run pre-prepared dungeons and procedural wilderness sandboxes. Essentially, you have to get the players to buy into an adventure's premise, but as long as they're on that adventure, be open to whatever paths they want to take, either literally or figuratively.<br/><br/>-Make your players write good BIFTs that are relevant to the adventure at hand (or tie them to the other party members), but don't worry too much about prepping towards them. In my WPM / AtG game, the only time I really put thought into making sure to "trigger" the PCs' BIFTs was during the interlude between the two published adventures.<br/><br/>Actually, what I did during that interlude was pretty interesting. I asked my players if they wanted a procedural sandbox, a completely handwaved uninteresting journey, or a few setpiece encounters / adventures along the way, and they opted for the third one. So it was a teesny bit Participationist in the sense that they knew they'd only encounter a few interesting things along the way, and that it was their job to engage with those things, but none of them had only a single method of approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478151/#Comment_478151" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-26T18:47:30+00:00" title="November 26, 2018  6:47PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

Only one person can roll (unless it's a group check, on which, more below), though if someone else can plausibly help, that grants Advantage (or cancels Disadvantage, obviously), and any failed roll has a definite consequence which leads to the next thing, etc.<br/><br/>Now, here's the interesting thing: if you gave this rule to a GM used to calling for lots of rolls in each scene, they'd <i>have</i> to stop doing that or the PCs would level up too quickly. Obviously, I'd explain my reasoning / procedures, and not just expect someone to magically get it, but giving XP for a failed roll really is a great way to say, hey, you know, that failure has to actually mean something.<br/><br/>Another salutary side-effect: it doesn't break the game at all if the PCs are usually rolling with Advantage. (As long as you're hygienic about making the helper narrate something genuinely relevant.) After all, they may be more likely to succeed in the check... but then they're not getting that sweet, sweet hit of the XP juice. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Group checks</span><br/>Really no different than anything else. If 50% or more of the PCs make the check, then the roll is successful, and if less than 50% are successful, the check fails, and 1 XP is put in the pool. I don't make the consequences of failure on a group check especially worse than on "normal" skill checks, although sometimes those consequences will be organically a bit more problematic (the entire group gets spotted vs. just the scout, for example).<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Combat</span><br/>Note the exception for multiple attacks in a round. This was a small exception that I implemented as a result of playtesting; characters with multiple attacks were generating too much XP even on rounds when they were accomplishing something. This was both mathematically bad and went against the intent of the rule, which is that earning XP should be a consolation for something bad happening to your character / to the party.<br/><br/>Now, it's true that I <i>don't</i> impose extra consequences for failing your attack(s); it's "just" a whiff. However, the action economy of 5E is sufficiently punishing that the XP is well-earned in those cases.<br/><br/>And if a PC makes some other sort of roll during combat, such as a saving throw or, yes, even a skill check to get something done (usually takes their main action, unless the skill check is as part of movement), they certainly get an XP for failing.<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hidden Rolls</span><br/>I pretty much just don't use them. Either I use the PCs' passive scores, or I just have the player with the best Perception or Insight roll, and rely on them to be fucking adults and understand the idea of dramatic irony.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478441/#Comment_478441" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-03T20:19:24+00:00" title="December  3, 2018  8:19PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answer, Matt.<br/><br/>I think that changing the way skill checks and such work is probably one of the BIGGEST changes you can make to the game in order to change its feel and style.

It's not terribly strong, but there is language in there about only rolling when dramatically appropriate.<br/><br/>The exception is that having the entire party roll individual Perception / Insight checks is, unfortunately, very common, and it's mathematically idiotic, of course. If GMs really feel like everyone should have a chance to notice a bad guy sneaking up or whatever, then make it a group check, I say: then what we're measuring is the "observant-ness" of the party as a whole.\n<blockquote>The next question is about BIFTs. You've already said that you don't interact with them much directly, in terms of your prep.<br/><br/>What makes for good BIFTs, and how does one write good ones? <br/><br/>What do the players do to get some "juice" out of them in play?<br/><br/>Are they all about inter-PC interactions, for example, like DW Bonds?<br/><br/>What's an example of a cool or fun thing that happens often in your game because of the BIFTs?</blockquote>\nThe Bond is generally to another PC, generating the kinds of intraparty drama / low-stakes conflict one would expect from, as you say, Dungeon World.<br/><br/>The Flaw and the Ideal are, "ideally" (LOL), things that will lead the character to sometimes make suboptimal decisions. In the case of the Flaw, this will generally be things that are "just" bad, like drinking too much or leaping before looking. Whereas Ideals should prompt players towards voluntarily taking on burdens or risks to further their Ideals. <br/><br/>While I will sometimes deliberately put scenarios in play to give the players opportunities to pursue their Ideals, generally speaking my players are pretty good about looking for and seizing those chances themselves. The most prominent example of the former that I can think of was during the "interlude" portion of the White Plume Mountain / Against the Giants campaign this year. One of the adventures they had along the way was someone asking them to help save an ancient library from destruction. <br/><br/>This was my attempt\u2014successful as it turned out\u2014to "ping" an Ideal the rogue/scholar Indiana Jones type guy had, about the importance of learning and research. The "smart" play would have just been to walk away entirely... but they obviously weren't going to do that. Partly because of the Ideal, but also because of the social contract we had about the way the Interlude would work.<br/><br/>The Traits are the trickiest of the four to make "sing" consistently, I'll definitely admit that. It's sort of a catch-all category for anything else important about the character that the player wants to express, but that doesn't fit neatly into the other boxes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478527/#Comment_478527" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-04T21:14:13+00:00" title="December  4, 2018  9:14PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lovely!<br/><br/>I think Traits are a bit of an issue, particularly since that's what D&amp;D players tend to focus on (and I believe he rules implying they're the most important, as well, since you get two of those and only one of each of the others). (IIRC)<br/><br/>A friend of mine I sent running a D&amp;D campaign in this style and he has found that things like Ideals and Beliefs: if played honestly and directly, eventually cause the players to head in different directions (e.g. that one character trying to rescue the books/library will naturally be opposed by the rest of the group, and ESPECIALLY so if the group has contrary Ideals). <br/><br/>It eventually hurt the game so much that they rewrote the BIFTs and the campaign Fronts to try to avoid this kind of trouble.<br/><br/>It seems to me that (we've discussed this recently, in the 5E thread!) that this means a functional group needs to have some way to rotate leadership/spotlight or just get really smart about learning when to step away and ignore their BIFTs for a moment.<br/><br/>However, I just realized that your game has some house rules which might be counteracting that:<br/><br/>Since XP is pooled, instead of individual, every player has a stake in supporting other characters' BIFTs. <br/><br/>Now that's interesting!<br/><br/>I could even see coupling this with a different award for going against your BIFT when supporting another PC. <br/><br/>The idea would be that, when a debate comes up, you know you don't lose your award by agreeing to go with the other PC. <br/><br/>Pooling the XP might be doing some heavy lifting in your group, then, improving this dynamic quite a lot. Hmmm!<br/><br/>About the skill checks:<br/><br/>I've never seen a D&amp;D group that doesn't roll for every little thing; and it's built into every module I've seen. (As an example, the last time I played D&amp;D, there was a stretch of time where we were sneaking around, and the way we handled it was to have each player make three Stealth checks and three Perception checks to represent a several hour long period. That's thirty rolls in just a few minutes of gameplay!<br/><br/>(I'm glad that you agree with me about the ridiculous ritual of making every player roll Perception or something similar that is ubiquitous in D&amp;D play! The math on that is hilarious.)<br/><br/>A few more questions for you on this subject:<br/><br/>1. In combat, a lot more rolls are made. Does that mean that's each combat is effectively a large XP payout for the group?<br/><br/>If so, do you feel that this replaces the standard encounter/combat XP, effectively?<br/><br/>Is it roughly an equal incentive to fight (instead of avoiding combat)? What's a typical "payout" for getting into a fight?<br/><br/>2. How do you deal with all the "do I know something" checks D&amp;D typically has (e.g. Nature, Religion, History, Arcana)? <br/><br/>Again, every D&amp;D game I've seen so far features quite a few of these, and some character builds depend on them.<br/><br/>2. On a related topic, do players ever ask to receive XP for failed passive checks (if they are important)?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478551/#Comment_478551" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-05T04:12:53+00:00" title="December  5, 2018  4:12AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the shared XP pool is absolutely crucial, for sure. Not sure any additional countervailing rewards are needed, at least in my experience so far.<br/><br/>On to your questions...<br/><br/>1) Remember that 5E combat often only lasts 2-3 rounds, so it's not as large an XP payout as you might think. Longer and thus more difficult combats generally do give out a modest amount of XP.<br/><br/>I think combat, per se, is neither incentivized nor disincentivized in my system. It's fun, for sure, and there are often obstacles in the PCs' way that need to be punched in the face, but that's as it should be.<br/><br/>2) Same way as any other skill check: sometimes just making "you don't know anything about this topic" the failure consequence is severe enough\u2014and remember, Let It Ride applies, so they can't just keep rolling. Other times, I'll give them bad or incomplete information and expect them to act on it.<br/><br/>3) Sure, if it ever came up I'd give it out.

That helps the players write BIFTs that are theme- and plot-relevant. So, for WPM / AtG, BIFTs about recovering magical or giantish knowledge / secrets were some of the best. General lust for treasure was also effective\u2014the Dwarf Samurai had that\u2014since it led to some suboptimal decisions that were very in-character. <br/><br/>Also those about intercultural conflict, especially for the later part of the campaign: one character had something about Dwarfish superiority, and another was just generally condescending to non-Elves. AtG involved not only Giant culture\u2014the snooty Elf was a grad student who was trying to collect as much Giantish macram\xe9 as possible\u2014but also Dwarvish, Elvish, and some local human nations as well. (The nice thing about Greyhawk as a setting is that it is far less gonzo than kitchen-sink / modern / Forgotten Realms D&amp;D. If a player desperately wanted to play, say, a Tabaxi, I might let them if they had a good reason or character concept, but there isn't suddenly going to be a nation of cat people.)<br/><br/>The great thing about BIFTs that make your character kind of a jerk is that you can break them and evolve them, and still earn XP for doing so. That's a major way to avoid the "party breaks apart if we play hard to our BIFTs" problem: the players have to all be committed to making the party as a unit function well, even if their characters aren't. The fact that BIFTs can change over time is one of those things that's obvious to Story Gamers, and isn't *prohibited* by the 5E text, but also isn't supported or mentioned at all. But it's absolutely necessary to avoid character stagnation.<br/><br/>Here are some specific BIFTs from roughly the midpoint of the campaign before AtG / WPM, when I ran Night's Dark Terror:<br/><br/>Khosef, Human Male Ranger<br/><br/>Bond<br/>Can I prove my worth to the people of Sukiskyn?<br/>Ideal<br/>The people, united, will never be defeated!<br/>Flaw<br/>Act first; deal with the consequences later.<br/>Trait1<br/>I\u2019d rather make friends than enemies.<br/>Trait2<br/>Can\u2019t resist a good mystery.<br/><br/>Tamara, Elven Female Warlock<br/><br/>Bond<br/>When the chips are down, will I side with the Elves or the Fey?<br/>Ideal<br/>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.<br/>Flaw<br/>I\u2019d rather eat my wand than admit when I\u2019m wrong.<br/>Trait1<br/>I\u2019m full of inspiring and cautionary tales relevant to almost any combat situation.<br/>Trait2<br/>The military lets me deal with my anger issues, but sometimes a gentler approach is needed.<br/><br/>Vladimir, Human Male Shaman (3rd party product)<br/><br/>Bond<br/>Can Golthar be trusted?<br/><br/>Ideal<br/>Never start a fight, but always finish one.<br/><br/>Flaw<br/>I can\u2019t resist a sarcastic quip.<br/><br/>T1<br/>I talk about people, not to them.<br/><br/>T2<br/>I cannot stifle laughter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478632/#Comment_478632" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-06T01:44:59+00:00" title="December  6, 2018  1:44AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2018 3:58PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting! Some part of me is inwardly cringing at someone who's NOT using some of the juicier BIFTs on that list to create some GM material (or some Bangs). Do you ever feel that temptation?<br/><br/>I also love the phrasing of some of those as questions - that opens up some new ways of using BIFTs and getting some variability out of them.<br/><br/>What criteria does your table use for Insp. rewards? For example, "I can't resist a sarcastic quip"... knowing you, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't enjoy an approach to play where the character makes a sarcastic quip occasionally and scores Inspiration.<br/><br/>Do you use an unwritten rule or criteria like, perhaps (the good old "best practice" for rules like these)...  <br/><br/>* When a BIFT leads you into trouble or causes problems for the group, score Inspiration.<br/><br/>Yes? Or something else?<br/><br/>Also, a quick question about group checks: does it ever bother anyone that having more or fewer people doesn't affect the odds? For instance, you'd think a whole bunch of people pulling together on something would be better than one person doing it alone (and vice-versa for, say, sneaking around)?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'm looking at your XP chart, and, again, knowing you, I'm sure that it's accurate and well-calibrate - you're good with numbers and diligent with such details.<br/><br/>What do you do when the number of players changes from session to session, or over the course of the campaign?<br/><br/>Second, I'm still surprised that you don't really consider combat XP in your estimates (which, otherwise, look very good to me). I was curious myself, so I turned to Critical Role this afternoon - I bet a lot of people use it as a model, and it's a good opportunity to be able to check on both the frequency of rolling and statistics on, e.g. the duration of combat.<br/><br/>Now, I already know that you almost certainly don't roll as often as they do (often up to a dozen rolls are made in a single social interaction!).<br/><br/>I found a combat sequence. Unfortunately, it wasn't very long, but I managed to write down how many rolls were made.<br/><br/>Here's the sequence:<br/><br/>* Perception rolls to spot the enemy in time (4 rolls, one per player) - (4)<br/>* The rogue hides (1)<br/>* Initiative for everyone (not going to count, since presumably there's no "fail" here)<br/>* Every character has to make a save against the creature's fear effect (4)<br/>* One character attacks, making multiple attacks - that's (1), by your rules, and unlikely to fail<br/>* The creature attacks, using an area effect. All must save. (4 rolls, one PC fails.)<br/>* The PC's turn is next, so he makes a death save. (1)<br/>* Another PC casts a targeted spell (1) and then uses some kind of healing as a bonus action (no possibility of failure, fortunately).<br/>* The last PC makes a handful of attacks. (1)<br/><br/>That's the first round. Remarkably, only two rolls miss, so that would net 2 XP, right?<br/><br/>However, it's 17 rolls. I'd expect it to be more like 4-8 misses typically, right? (Against stiff opposition... this creature isn't terribly dangerous, it turns out. In the second round there are only 4 more rolls before a powerful spell destroys it. There might have been another miss in there, on a less lucky day, I'd imagine.)<br/><br/>But, in the Critical Role stats (see that thread if you're curious) I see that the average fight lasts 4 or 5 rounds. Even if there was only one failure in the whole group by round, that would be as much XP as any given player generates through the whole session, wouldn't it? And there is always the possibility for multiple rolls per turn due to status effects, attacks of opportunity, or even asking to roll Arcana to figure out what the enemy is doing.<br/><br/>I would generally expect at least 1 or 2 rolls per round per PC, so a 4-player, 4-round combat would mean 16-32 rolls, wouldn't it?<br/><br/>This is admittedly just curiosity on my part, though - not as important as the BIFTs stuff, and other larger-scale concerns. I'm just thinking out loud, because I've been thinking about D&amp;D a bunch over the last week!<br/><br/>I don't doubt your conclusion - you're very diligent with this stuff - but I'm trying to figure out how we 'get there', so to speak.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478679/#Comment_478679" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T00:28:33+00:00" title="December  7, 2018 12:28AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I absolutely will throw something into my prep that "pings" off a BIFT if I have a clear idea how to. I just don't feel obligated to, so long as there's a module to run.<br/><br/>Yes, the general aesthetic standard is that you can't earn Inspiration for "just talking." A sarcastic quip that derailed a tense negotiation, however... or even one that earned the amusement of a bandit king or something, that would be worth Insp. (It's important to me that people not earn Inspiration only for doing dumb / bad / disruptive things; BIFTs should also inspire heroism and innovation that would not otherwise have occurred.)<br/><br/>Combat XP is factored into my XP table. I just double checked it. The number of failed rolls per session incorporates how often people fail rolls in combat, in my estimation, though as I also note, my estimates are deliberately low.<br/><br/>But here's the more interesting thing: yes, overall, combat is a good source of XP relative to just running around making skill checks. However, PCs in my games really can't survive constant combat, because I've actually got the resource management / resting stuff working to put pressure on them. And specifically, if you do get in a combat, you really <i>don't</i> want to get XP from it, since that means you're probably taking a lot of damage! And remember, any combat that goes longer than 3 rounds is likely super-serious and involves quite dangerous enemies. So, I've never had players get too trigger-happy.<br/><br/>Also, note the way the end-of-session award for combat works. I decided to depart a bit from Dungeon World here, and award more than 1 XP if the PCs take down a particularly terrible foe. But the important thing is that it's for the toughest single foe defeated. So if a 5th-level party defeats a CR10 creature, they get 5 XP at end-of-session. Now, 5th-level characters taking down a CR10 creature is not impossible... if they can get it alone. Whereas if it has 2 or 3 lower-CR minions with it, suddenly that fight is <i>very</i> deadly indeed. Bam. Now, suddenly, the PCs have a good reason to use clever tactics and isolate big baddies. Hasn't happened a ton, but once or twice it's made a difference.<br/><br/>I did deal with the loss of a player most of the way through Night's Dark Terror. The XP chart was less sensitive, then, and it was obvious how to deal with the problem, but worked less well. In other words, the threshold to level up was simply some multiple of the number of players, but I noticed that the system wasn't really accounting for the greater spotlight-per-person in smaller groups, which is why I changed it to its current form.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I think we'd just look at what fraction of the way to the next level they were, and then switch to the appropriate column of the chart with that many XP. So, let's say a party of 4 PCs is halfway between levels 7 and 8 when a 5th player joins. Instead of being at 27 out of 54 XP needed, they're now at 29 out of 58 XP, and then we just proceed from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478715/#Comment_478715" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T19:47:58+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  7:47PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answers, Matt!

(If I were to do that, I'd tie in the BIFTs &amp; Inspiration in some other way.)<br/><br/>Paul, as to your question: what makes you think these modules are linear? All three that I've run in 5E (Night's Dark Terror, White Plume Mountain, and Against the Giants) are pre-DragonLance. (Oh, I also ran part of a 5E-ified 3E module, Sunless Citadel, and found it perfectly sandboxy... though I also created a small sandbox in the area around the Sunless Citadel itself.) I wouldn't attempt to run DragonLance in 5E. (I did successfully run DL1 using Dungeon World in 2012, but looked at the other modules and realized they would be much harder to make non-railroady.)<br/><br/>Funny story: I saw some of my players from the WPM/AtG game on Saturday at my birthday luncheon. One guy said his favorite part of the game was actually the interlude between the two dungeons, even though he liked all of it. I found that so fascinating because that was the most railroaded part: I simply created three "waypoints" along their route between the two dungeons, that would present them with a challenge they needed to handle. It wasn't a total railroad, in the sense that they had genuine freedom of choice in how to handle those waypoints, and the choices they made in the first one impacted the later ones, etc. Still, it was a surprising comment.<br/><br/>However, come to think of it, I've used that "waypoint" structure in other adventure designs. For instance, there's a Burning Wheel con scenario I wrote and only ran once, entitled "The Three Trials of the Seven Pilgrims." It was actually a spinoff to a home campaign\u2014the six PCs were all junior clerics, and their guide, who was an NPC in this scenario, was one of the PCs in my home game, a fearsome inquisitor / holy knight type. The title basically says it all: along the way to the holy place they were trying to get to, they encountered three things, and had to figure out how to deal with them. The choices they made impacted their relationships with one another, how they each felt individually about their faith, etc. So it was a great game, and had lots of unexpected twists and turns, but not in terms of "where do we go now?" type questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479279/#Comment_479279" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-23T21:13:28+00:00" title="December 23, 2018  9:13PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> 's XP table and clarification of BIFTs are working pretty great at the table.

(Does that seem about right, Matt?)<br/><br/>Thinking of D&amp;D as modeling a "superhero" genre clarified some things for me. In superhero fiction, there is a mismatched team of heroes, who balance each other out and contrast each other. They have some interesting dynamics and minor conflicts, but ultimately always stay "on the same team" (with rare and dramatic exceptions). Using that as a model, I can see how BIFTs can be set up to play into that quite nicely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479297/#Comment_479297" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-24T14:39:33+00:00" title="December 24, 2018  2:39PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Will do.
