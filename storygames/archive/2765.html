I'm a 24-hours-game and (just now) Game Chef veteran, but I am very used to the "game master" style of game play, and the game I'm thinking about involves something different.<br/><br/>So I was wondering if someone can point me to a list of story games, not because I want to play, but because I want to look over the "mechanics." This is a diceless game as well -- essentially just a storytelling exercise, not a competitive or task resolution based game -- so if anyone can point me specifically to games of that kind, it would help a lot.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63100/#Comment_63100" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T08:51:51+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  8:51AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you mean by "GMless"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63101/#Comment_63101" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T09:02:13+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  9:02AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few games that come up here a lot and have "distributed" rather than "centralized" GM-type authority include Capes, Polaris, Shab-al-Hiri Roach, and Shock:<br/><br/>There are no doubt more that escape me at the moment. <br/><br/>Vaxalon's question gets at the multiple kinds of authority that devolve upon the GM in "traditional" games, and the different ways there are of unpacking or redistributiong that authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63102/#Comment_63102" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T09:04:18+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  9:04AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, they don't have a player designated to "run the game" a la Dungeons and Dragons and more traditional RPGs, but instead has co-equal players who build a story together.<br/><br/>However, the story game as I see it doesn't involve conflict that can be resolved through game mechanics (dice, cards, bidding, whatever), so maybe I'm looking for an even more specific type of game?<br/><br/>Basically, I am just looking for ideas on how to handle the flow of the game when conflict and success don't matter.

First, even "GM-less" games need to cover the bases of GM-responsibility either through system or through distribution to the players.  Chris points out that making a game GM-less "because you can" is often self-defeating.  The experience of many genres is often enhanced by a centralized authority, coordinated opposition, and so on.<br>[shameless plug alert]<br/>When I started on my current project, I explored how each of the traditional conventions applied to the experience I was creating.  My game is partly about Exestentialism.  One of the tennants of that philosophy is that life is without order or meaning (except that which you impose on it, generating Existential Angst, but that is a topic for another day.)  GM==plot and structure, Existentialism =/= plot and structure, :. GM's gotta go.  I would not have created an Epic Fantasy game without a GM, because the benefits of having one (coordinated opposition, structure, plot) are IMHO vital to that genre.<br/>In the process of creating my game, rough playtest draft though it is, what I think is an important insight did occur to me.  One of the key responsibilities of a GM is to end the game.  In a GM-less game, there should be an end-state.  Without an endgame, the play continues until the players get tired of the game, so while the beginning of the game will likely be full of "HARDCORE!" the end will be mediocre, leaving the overall experience being average at best which is not-awesome.  If the game ends in the "HARDCORE!" phase of play, the experience will remain "HARDCORE!" which is awesome.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63125/#Comment_63125" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T10:36:06+00:00" title="April  6, 2007 10:36AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2007 10:37AM by DirkGently.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Kynn! I agree with Andrew Morris... Universalis sounds to be right on the money for you (I can't think of any system that does the collaborative storytelling thing better)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that being said, if you don't want conflict resolution... why don't you just run it in the way that 'real' collaborative storytelling is done. Essentially, you go around in a circle and each player adds a sentence or element that CANNOT contradict or 'reimagine' (at least in a cheap way) what has gone before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis method is slightly more difficult if you want each person to still have a 'character' to play (in addition to general narrative and NPC characters)... if this is the case you might want to look at Prime Time Adventures. It has a GM and it has a card based 'conflict' resolution method (which are counter to your original point) but there is really no success or failure... just a question of who gets narrative control. Still, everyone is expected to use 'conflicts' to produce interesting stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63130/#Comment_63130" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T10:45:29+00:00" title="April  6, 2007 10:45AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2007 10:47AM by Andrew Morris.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll point once again to Universalis.

Like, the way it works in Shock: is, I say what I want, you say what you want, and we roll different dice for the things we want and against the things our opponent wants. Maybe they both happen, maybe neither happens, maybe one of us gets what we want and the other doesn't, but it twists the story significantly every time the dice are rolled. Resolution of tasks is not really what's at stake; what the dice decide (as indeed they always do) is who gets to say what about the fiction.</p>\n<p>If you don't want unpredictability, I can imagine several other mechanics that might serve you: voting; spending coins on events; a map of the set and you can move counters from spot to spot and use the place, props, and characters that are in a particular space.</p>\n<p>Really, though, this is a perfect discussion for <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=1dfouimqbu4eqe7b9rfqnbqq03&amp;board=61.0" rel="nofollow">Forge First Thoughts</a>. It sounds like there are particular features to this game that will make you happy, but you might need some folks to bounce ideas off to get those features defined well.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, Shock: started off diceless, with only human decisions and resources to push the story one way or another. The resource tokens became dice and the game became much better. It made it so that, instead of spending the maximum to get what you want every time (or not having the tokens to do it), you're instead able to take a risk. That adds tension.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63196/#Comment_63196" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-07T09:16:55+00:00" title="April  7, 2007  9:16AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Karyn, ...</blockquote>\nWho? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63200/#Comment_63200" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-07T11:09:18+00:00" title="April  7, 2007 11:09AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What anemone said.<br/><br/>More specifically, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Console_Legends" rel="nofollow">Console Legends</a>. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
