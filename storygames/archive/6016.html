It's a super-hero game.  (While Scattershot is a multi-genre game with strong Transition capabilities, I will be focusing U6 for this post.)<br/><br/>The <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2005/12/what-are-big-three.html/" rel="nofollow">Big Three</a>\n<ol><li><b>What is your game about?</b>\n<blockquote>You get superpowers!  You fight evil (or good)!  You take out the garbage!</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What do the characters do?</b>\n<blockquote>They constantly battle in the epic struggle of good versus evil, then go home and deal with day-to-day life.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What do the players do?</b>\n<blockquote>Make up superpowered characters who live out the escapist fantasies of the people playing them.</blockquote></li></ol>\nThe <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/01/what-are-power-19-pt-1.html/" rel="nofollow">Power Nineteen</a>\n<ol><li><b>What is your game about?</b>\n<blockquote>Players create characters and join the world of spandex-clad superheroes and villains.  While battles between good and evil punctuate play, the bulk occurs 'behind the seams'.  I'm somewhat shocked how close <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soon-Will-Be-Invincible-Novel/dp/0375424865/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1205430971&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">Soon I Will Be Invincible</a> comes to the tenor of the game.  Go read it!</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What do the characters do?</b>\n<blockquote>They address to somewhat logical consequences of living out their players' power fantasies and how it impacts life in general.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?</b>\n<blockquote>Earn, trade and use a meta-game resource, while living out their own superhero fantasies in play.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</b>\n<blockquote>The broad list of powered individuals mesh with the 'right out of reality' metropolis creating a game that functions on two distinct levels, epic and familiar.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?</b>\n<blockquote>By focusing on little more than powers and combat, the game masquerades as a old-style superhero game.  The effect of what appear to be cliched character background elements create the apparently unlikely focus of the game.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?</b>\n<blockquote>The meta-game strongly rewards playing towards the tropes of silver-age superhero comics as well as quietly urging players to play their characters as written.  There is minor 'punishment' for not using the meta-game elements in that the probabilities are less than 50% without.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?</b>\n<blockquote>Characters have advantages and disadvantages which the players activate through play that reward in-game, meta-game currency.  That's right, you get paid to suffer from your disadvantages.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?</b>\n<blockquote>The whole process of play is built around introducing complications.  While the text doesn't spend a lot of time dwelling on it, it quite clearly puts the ability to narrate these in the hands of the players as well as the gamemaster. The resolution system equally doubles as a player arbitration system when <i>players</i> conflict.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)</b>\n<blockquote>In an unusual twist, the gamemaster also makes use of a character sheet; not one for NPCs, but one for the milieu.  Players are rewarded in meta-game currency for activating advantages and disadvantages off this sheet as well as the gamemaster.  Since there is always a need for this currency, everyone is looking for opportunities to acquire them.<br/><br/>Otherwise, who doesn't like playing out their ultimate power trip?</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?</b>\n<blockquote>While apparently being a 'we both roll dice and compare' system, it's a cleverly hidden roll against a static number system.  Skill - 2d10 = 'static number' rating of success or failure.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?</b>\n<blockquote>Being as nearly every roll requires the use of meta-game currency to succeed and those are earned by invoking the central purpose of the game, I'd say yes.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?</b>\n<blockquote>In the source material, their superpowers rarely, if ever, change.  Their 'real life' problems are a constantly evolving stew of pathos and misadventure.  If a player desires, they may use the clearly laid out system to 'improve' their character either in increased powers or decreased problems, this is secretly counter-productive to play.  This 'advancement system' secretly gets the individual players to set their own separate comfort levels in dealing with the difficulties of play.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</b>\n<blockquote>If the characters 'advance', meaning becoming less subject to the tropes of the game.  They also lose efficacy.  As a player power fantasy, playing 'away' from the game's purpose dis-empowers the player (with incentives at every turn).</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?</b>\n<blockquote>Two things: because the milieu sheet calls for escalating tension and final confrontations, on-going games will quietly (or unexpectedly) lay themselves out as fairly normal story forms allowing players to tell effective stories about their play.  Secondly, as broad, power fantasy escapism, it allows people to work out whatever tensions or problems they face in their 'real lives'.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?</b>\n<blockquote>Both the NPCs (rogue's gallery and heroic legions) and realistic metropolis (based on and lifted directly from Minneapolis) are the apparent whole of the color.  Secretly, the advantages and disadvantages are carefully crafted tropes designed to keep the game on familiar comic book foundations.  The reason for this is so that, for as brightly coloured as the background is, it will become as comfortable as an old pair of tights.  Thus 'disappearing' and leaving the players to deal with the real, though unspecified, meat of the game: "Superpowers don't solve your problems."</blockquote></li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134635/#Comment_134635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T13:07:29+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  1:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<ol><li><b>Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in?

Other games of this sort don't really mention this, instead claiming to model superheroics more accurately.  The use and application of tropes through the meta-game ensures better modeling of superhero comics than any single member of the play group could manage. (I don't have to pre-plan or prescribe an arbitrary verisimilitude that would be 'too real' for some and 'not real enough' for others.  The players will introduce and maintain the balance without knowing I'm making them do it.)<br/><br/>All that and when combined with other components of the Scattershot line will allow it to break out of the incoherence trap into full Transition.</blockquote></li>\n<li><b>What are your publishing goals for your game?</b>\n<blockquote>None whatsoever.

In other words, how will you present your Setting or what resources will you include that lets players know that they can use it to make both Epic Adventures and Familiar Adventures?<br/>That's a really good question.  (/me turns aside and quickly fiddles with his website.)<br/><br/>I've developed a gimmick where you won't find another tired list of powers or heroes or places et cetera.  Each power listed will include a write-up of a single super-being (as well as two solid uncommon application samples).  Each advantage or disadvantage will include a write-up of a locale in Minneapolis or St Paul.<br/><br/>For example, the milieu advantage, <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/superpower/index.php?module=wiki&amp;page=AdventurersAssemble" rel="nofollow">Adventurers Assemble!</a> includes the write-up of <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/superpower/index.php?module=photoalbum&amp;PHPWS_Album_id=1&amp;PHPWS_Photo_id=1&amp;PHPWS_Photo_op=view" rel="nofollow">Quorn Base Midwest</a>.  It concerns personal meetings between superheroes and implies this with the base's write-up.  If you look at the advantage, you gain more meta-resource if you have problems within your group and it gives suggestions of what might happen.  Those suggestions are largely familiar in nature, personality clashes and such.<br/><br/>The milieu disadvantage <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/superpower/index.php?module=wiki&amp;page=MilieuDeathtrap" rel="nofollow">Deathtrap</a> details how the classic (epic) deathtrap confrontation occurs and there's more meta-resource when the confrontation is more epic.<br/><br/>These are just the prototypes I've rushed out in order to provide examples of the features of the system.  As you can see, each requires a fair amount of writing to create.  I'm just one person and would greatly like any help I could get!<br/><br/>Thanks for your thoughtful question.  I hope what I'm doing is becoming more clear as we go.<br/><br/>Fang Langford                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134925/#Comment_134925" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T12:56:48+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 12:56PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Could you tell us briefly what kind of feedback would you like? And perhaps a bit about what's cool about the game.</blockquote>\nWow, that's a great question.  I'm glad you asked, because it really gets at why I've started posting here.<br/><br/>I'll have to answer this on two levels because I'm a bit at odds with myself.  On one level, for my game's sake, I need help!  This project is so huge; it will outlive me if I press on alone.  I have lists of things to put in, but scant descriptions or explanations.  Also my writing style leaves a lot to be desired from a player's point of view, so I welcome any help clarifying what I write.  Frankly, any kind of help...well, helps.  Full credit to any helpers but copyright stays with me (don't be mad).<br/><br/>On the other level, this is a role-playing game.  It lives to be played.  Its birth will occur though bloody and painful playtesting.  Without an audience the whole thing is a colossal fool's errand.  (I already have a reputation around the internet - go ahead Google "Fang.Langford -joueur" - isn't it time I put my money where my mouth is?)  So, as a good steward of my resources, I need to make this game as good as much audience would demand.<br/><br/>Unlike big-ticket superhero games\xb9 Scattershot isn't focused on building characters with the intention of emulating the genre; it really is built to emulate the genre.  The bulk of the book is character creation and combat rules, but the bulk of play can't help but center around playing the characters as written.  Writing characters offers opportunities to include advantages and disadvantages that reflect what kind of character they are and what kind of escapades the player expects.<br/><br/>But there's a trick to the whole thing.<br/><br/>If you play the game ignoring the meta-game elements, your characters will be largely ineffectual.  It's just how the die rolls work out.  The more you use the meta-game resources, which spring entirely out of the character's advantages and disadvantages, the more the game will turn towards both the players' expectations and the expectations of the genre; this is surprisingly a self-adjusting system that always finds your comfort level.<br/><br/>I've also (finally) came up with another innovation.  Milieu write-ups: the gamemaster is 'playing' the game as much as the players.  While the players create characters he creates the milieu.  He writes advantages and disadvantages on his write-up in much the same way they do.  His write-up intensely clarifies what kind of game the group will play.  No surprises (not jarring ones that is) and no confusion, everything will be spelled out explicitly.  What can make this even more fun is that I've taken away the gamemaster's bottomless bag of tricks.  She will also have to play the meta-game with all of its limited resources and allocations just like the players.<br/><br/>I've already put up <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/superpower/" rel="nofollow">a couple of Milieu disadvantages and advantages</a> to show something of how this part works.  From <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/superpower/index.php?module=wiki&amp;page=MilieuDeathtrap" rel="nofollow">Deathtrap</a> and <a href="http://universe6.scattershotgames.com/superpower/index.php?module=wiki&amp;page=AdventurersAssemble" rel="nofollow">Adventures Assemble!</a>, you should be able to get a taste of how it prompts the genre.<br/><br/>And since this game's form is a website, we should be able to create a limitless list of these things.<br/><br/>So I guess the kinds of feedback I'd like, would be a little playtesting and authoring on the site, but mostly discussion of the application of the meta-game including how the gamemaster must take part.  The rest of the game is meant to be as bog-standard <i>looking</i> as you could possibly expect (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=1265.0" rel="nofollow">but it's not</a>).  Okay mostly playtesting!<br/><br/>Fang Langford<br/><br/>\xb9 Like Marvel Superheroes or DC Heroes or Champions                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
