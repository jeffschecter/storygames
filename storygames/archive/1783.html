                    This is a little subjective, and your mileage will certainly vary, but some games are easier to grasp after a thorough reading than others.  It often seems that there is some emergent property that manifests in play that makes a game great that is not captured in the text.  <br/><br/>Sorcerer was like this for me - the text was a brick wall, but in play I can see how it all works to bring the ...<i> word Nathan has forbidden.</i><br/><br/>The fan-mail currency in PTA is another example of an elegant, critical system that is not at all obvious on first read, but makes perfect sense when you see it in action.  <br/><br/>You could probably argue that Keys in TSOY don't really demonstrate their power until they are bought, used, chained, and bought off in play.  There's always moment of dawning awareness as a new player grasps the potential of Keys.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced that devoting pages to explaining the cool things that will happen when you actually play would be useful in any of these cases.  Actually playing, of course, solves the problem.<br/><br/>So my questions:  What are other examples of games that really must be experienced to be appreciated, and what are games that demonstrate what makes them mechanically interesting on first reading?  Are some qualities too variable, subtle, or complex that they can't be accurately captured outside of play?  If so, how can this be communicated to a reader?  Should it be?                </div>

                            My "game text is all but understandable, game is cool when shown by someone who already knows it" price goes to Capes. If you go and ask about rules clarifications, you're immediately sent over to read the FAQ, watch the Flash Demo and try it out a bit. I don't know a single person that understood the mechanics of Capes from reading the rules. There are two things that make this very hard - the forward references to concepts not introduced yet, and the layout of the references as big black dots with tiny white numbers in that break the flow of a sentence even if you try to cut out the reference for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
I must say that I still lack the experience of a smoothly running game, although I had loads of fun with the demos I ran. But that was only possible after I was shown the ropes of the game by a crazy finn.<br/>
<br/>
Runner-Up is Shadow of Yesterday's 'Bringing down the Pain', which also takes some heavy thinking to grok. Also, the book itself is organized miserably. It sorely misses an index, and sprinkling secrets and keys all over the book might enhance locality of reference, but is bad for referencing stuff in an ongoing game. Contrary to Jason, I think the Keys are very easily understood, but a lot of people may think that this reaping of XP must be wrong somehow...<br/>
<br/>
So, now the other side of the fence: When I was reading With Great Power, at first I thought Mike was addressing half-brained monkeys, but reading further and further I realized he introduced one concept at a time, and the book was written in a way that you could go from start to end while 'trying out' the rules without missing important steps at the beginning because of missing rules or concepts. I must admit that I think the number of poker decks needed to run a game of WGP has deterred me from trying a game, and I see the author's advice to buy card holders as an indication of imperfect design.<br/>
Universalis (Revised) has a similar feel, although I need to re-read the book.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best game texts in my collection is (and this might not surprise a lot of people) Dogs in the Vineyard. It still shines as an example of a game playable as written resulting in the experience promised. More praise can be found elsewhere. I am waiting for Spirit of the Century to arrive in print before I start praising it in full, but it is an entertaining read that covers it's topic with a lot of practical advice and shows that a lot of thought has gone into the design of the book. The only problem it has that it is a bit defensive in some places. The Tips and Tricks section is advice that shows the authors are on top of current rpg praxis.<br/>
<br/>
There is a third category of games that might be out of the scope of this thread, since it might just be a matter of taste: games that simple bore the reader to death and kill interest in running it and induce severe somnia when you try to crack them open to read them. I am thinking of Hollow Earth Expedition and Hero's Banner in particular. In fact, I forced myself to read HEX last weekend, and found about 30 pages to be barely interesting. Reading the fiction the game riffs off would probably have been time better invested.                        </div>

                            Capes.  And I second your nomination of Sorcerer.  (I wonder how much time Ron has spent clarifying things on his forum?)<br/>
<br/>
I found the Pool and Primetime Adventures pretty easy to grasp on first reading.  With Great Power made a lot of sense too.<br/>
<br/>
Shadow of Yesterday wasn't hard to understand, though you're right: Keys, and Bringing Down the Pain, look a little different once you've seen them in action.<br/>
<br/>
With Sorcerer, Ron's said several times that the current audience for the game is much broader than the one he'd originally intended, and also several Forgey concepts are clear now but were hardly clear in the late 90's.  This might be true.  But I think there's also a little bit of, "Hey, I'm only going to go so far to help you out here, you gotta work with me" that comes through in the text--this hatred of spoonfeeding.  Which, as a stylistic choice, is fine--but it means that everyone's going to misinterpret what you say.<br/>
<br/>
With Capes, I don't know what it is.  I confess the rules are clear enough after you've seen them in play a few times.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there's much that can't be captured in words, if you're perceptive enough to see it and are willing to think hard enough about how to say it.                        </div>

                            Capes.  It's difficult to grasp from the text, but all the little pieces fit together in play.  I don't think mechanics like the ones in Capes can be communicated easily by text.  You need to be able to see the parts moving around.  Without that, you can only grasp little pieces of the game.  Wasn't there a flash animation designed to teach the game?  How did that work?<br><br>Conversely, the coolness of My Life with Master was obvious to me from the first reading.  You can easily see (possibly with the help of a cheat sheet) how the variables are changed, and how they result in certain scenes and in endgame.                        </br></br></div>

                            (edit, this was crossposted with everything post-thor, so I repeat some of the stuff written above)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm not convinced that devoting pages to explaining the cool things that will happen when you actually play would be useful in any of these cases.  Actually playing, of course, solves the problem.</blockquote>
I'm actually deep in the Other Camp. All the above could have been written better to show exactly how it would be useful.<br><br>Sorcerer is an awesome game, but the following happens all the time:<br><br>Person A buys and reads or plays the game.<br/>They have a few questions, so they go to The Forge to ask about it in Ron's forum.<br/>Some Other Dude jumps in and tells him how he's playing it wrong. :-)<br/>Then Ron sets the dude straight. More often than not, it clicks. And either the dude loves it or hates it (usually loves it if they've kept with it for this long, seeing that something cool is there but not quite getting it).<br/><br/>My question is, "Why this mentorship, just to "get" the game?" It's a lot of work. It certainly draws people in (it worked on me), but IMO it's a classic example of needing more explanation to show how things can be cool. Admittedly, hindsight is 20/20 and all that, and none of this could have really been anticipated at the time the book was written.<br/><br/>When Mark Causey explains the TSOY rules to people, he has this speech on how Keys are awesome, and why the game rocks for them. He succinctly goes into why they work the way they work, what they can do in play, and all-in-all his explanation, if converted to text, would be about the length of half a page. The thing is, people listen to Mark's explanation, and they "Get It" even before the adventure has begun, or even before they look at the sheet. It's because Mark supplies the text, verbally, that could have been put in the book.<br/><br/>I'm watching this thread over on RPGNet here ( <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=296444" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=296444</a> ) where the dude has some questions that, heck, not even I can answer all of them off the top of my head, and I pride myself on knowing PTA back and forth. Now, this dude's questions are primarily technical, but some of the questions there make it seem like the text has room to be refined (in the future and all) to accommodate questions like these, and perhaps explain exactly why fanmail exists. Because sure, you find out how cool and deep fanmail is in the game, but the author could have just devoted a sidebar to what Fanmail should be like and feel like, to save people from groping around.<br/><br/>Look at Dogs in the Vineyard.  The only folks who truly don't "get it" before playing are the ones who go, "Oh, that game is all about Mormons and Fundamentalism and oohh yuck oppression!" So fuck those dudes.<br/><br/>But Vincent really took a lot of time to explicitly state (IIRC, it's been a while since I've read the text) WHY the initiation scene is important, what the implications of the rules are, etc, in an extremely personable, matter-of-fact way. He even asks rhetorical questions to the reader in the text, something to the extent of, "You see how this can be interesting, right?" and the like.<br/><br/>So yeah, some folks say "You can only understand through playing it".  But I say, "Sure, you might find a deeper understanding, or the mechanics really shine or click for you.  But if you cannot <i>understand</i> from the get-go why a mechanic is important (it seems "left field" to you) or why it was used in the game, that's entirely the fault of the author."                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            PTA: Easy to read, harder to reference. I played my first game at MACE last weekend, and it all clicked nicely. I now look forward to trying it again, knowing how it works and what its limitations are.<br/><br/>Dogs: Easy to read, easy to reference. I still haven't played it, but the mechanics lit me up. It's all laid out, and the poker-style dice mechanics seem very elegant.<br/><br/>Mountain Witch and Hero's Banner: Written like master's theses. Not dry, per se, but the rules aren't as engaging as I might hope. I enjoyed playing MW and haven't finished reading HB, but both seem more fun to play than to read.<br/><br/>This thread really gets me thinking two things:<br/><br/>One, I think it might be useful for the game designer to create a thread of actual play, going through each portion of the game with chosen players, step by step, post by post, as a resource for people who've read the book but don't fully grok how play works. I think this would be immensely useful for would-be GMs who aren't in a position to play the game themselves before they attempt to run it.<br/><br/>Two, folks like Mark should <i>write down and/or record their speeches!</i> Again, even if the transcripts are just posted somewhere (here, the Forge, the game's website), it's another tool in the gamer's arsenal. I'm as guilty as other folks - I used to have a bit of speech for aspects vs. skills in FATE, which I need to revise in the light of the new SotC text. Eventually, these could be incorporated into revised texts, sure, but having a bit of a con game speech to make the ramp-up to gameplay faster and better would be fantastic.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Complete agreement, Harald.<br/><br/>So what can we learn from these examples?  What makes a game readable and understandable?</blockquote>
a) Examples that not only show mechanics in use, but also explain the goals of the players and characters (this is what the flash demo for capes does on a level (actually, three levels) that'd be hard to do in print. Death's Door has an example section at the bottom of every page, and an ongoing story is used for reference in the examples).<br/><br/>b) Rules that are structured in a way that they can be explained without back references (I like to read my books front to back, and put them away at times as well).<br/><br/>c) putting Andy's
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>So yeah, some folks say "You can only understand through playing it". But I say, "Sure, you might find a deeper understanding, or the mechanics really shine or click for you. But if you cannot understand from the get-go why a mechanic is important (it seems "left field" to you) or why it was used in the game, that's entirely the fault of the author."<br/></blockquote>
into a positive context, I'd like to say:<br/><br/>The mechanics presented should by and in themselves (optionally with the help of a good, concise example) show why they are part of the rules as written to make the game work the way intended and promised by the author.<br/><br/>d) A game should have a clear intention/promise by the author. Reading the rules should show you how to get on the path the intention lays out and whose destination is the fulfillment of this promise.                        </div>

                            Here is a slightly different question--is it actually playing that generates the aha moment in most of the cases so far or could it be seeing actual play?  I have a feeling that some of the cool factor to many of these mechanics are best appreciated over the course of a session, as you see how they <b><i>shape</i></b> the game in different ways.  <br/><br/>Sure, you can kinda-sorta get how keys guide play, but when you see them panning out over the course of a session, well, that really brings the point home.  Same with fanmail--it is its impact over the course of an entire session and game that makes it so cool.<br/><br/>Now, watching actual play gets you this, although not quite so vividly as when you play yourself, actually manipulating the tools and seeing their impact...<br/><br/>Which makes me think that it is not so much a question of subtlety or complexity, but a question of how powerfully time-driven rpg's are.  No description can quite capture the way in which things function over time without, well, extracting from the process what is it's most essential element.  I remember reading in The New Science (too lazy to look up the author's name) about some algorithms that could only be 'answered' by carrying out each step of the process--that there was no way to abstract the answer without just doing each iterative step.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm interested in talking about how to address intangibles and emergent factors in actual play.</blockquote>
I find this really hard to seperate out. "Intangibles" and "Emergent factors" are just "Things that happen in the game". Take the time, and someone is eventually going to be able to talk about how they happen in the game.<br/><br/>Look at all those "Sell me on (Insert Indie Game Here)" threads at RPGNet and the like.  Someone says, "This game seems interesting, but could someone tell me more about it?" More often than not, someone quickly jumps in and talks about really cool 'intangibles' (as you refer to them) that happen in her session. These intangibles are not drift, they are specific game play things that happened solely because the game was set up to run the way it was. Most likely the author of the game was already aware of those tangibles, sometimes their 'deepness' is discovered and promulgated by other people (like Spiritual Attributes in The Riddle of Steel, probably the best example of that).<br/><br/>In any case, it's my strong opinion that the game should have come right out and laid those intangibles right in the text by means of sidebars, text boxes, further explanation and the like. Often fans of the game can describe the cool intangible elements of the game in a way that is readily understandable, and will get a viewer (in the case above, "The person who started the Sell Me On thread") actively looking to use and exploit those intangibles.<br/><br/>Do you see what I'm saying? I'm not all "author sucks for not writing good" here, I'm saying that RPG texts can very definitely talk about the emergent factors that the game's rules or structure lead to (even in broad brushstrokes), if nothing else than to whet the player's appetite for play, or to get him to realize that This IS (or isn't) The Game She's Been Waiting For. But few texts do so.<br/><br/>I hope I'm not off base here (LMK if I am Jason), but again I think that there are intangibles that emerge through play, but the simple fact that some fan dude can tell me in two minutes about "his actual play campaign" or about what he thinks the game does well, and I can see the shadows of those intangible things (now made tangible because this dude told me what happened at his table)... well, I start to think, "Why don't more people put this kind of thing in their game text?"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            MURPG - Because play involves moving stones around on a character sheet and in and out of pools, there is a tactile element to learning that I've found shoves players up the learning curve a LOT faster than writing down numbers and erasing them and writing other numbers, or just reading.                        </div>

                            Jason, to address your intentions, one of Mountain Witch's properties is the relationship between Trust points and number/scale of conflicts. The first time I ran it, I had the players rolling like crazy, which made Trust points almost worthless. They ran out quickly, didn't aid much on one roll, and couldn't be adjusted until an act break. The second time I ran it, I got the balance better, and by the time we were finished with our game, players understood more about how to use Trust points and <i>when withholding them from others was effective</i>. But it took me two full games (running more or less simultaneously, session-wise) before I internalized these properties.<br/><br/>To get at what I think you're trying to get at, some texts make it easier or hard to internalize the principles presented in the texts themselves, but the principles read between the lines may not be read until played and almost certainly not understood or internalized until played. Ultimately, I think these are the things that should be added to a revised text, to make them clear. I don't want a strategy section in every game, but if there are significant play decisions or some rules are more important than others, authors should try to make that clear, as well as get at the <i>implications </i>of game decisions that may not be clear on the surface of the rules.<br/><br/>Just my two cents' worth.                        </div>

                            Create texts like the economy of fan mail and budget section in the revised section of PtA. It may not convey the 'experience' of a given intangible, but it is a good way to show people what to look out for in the application of the game. Capes has a strategy section, which is nice. What's important here is to not only show <i>how</i> to manipulate parts of the games, but <i>why</i> one would want to do that - ideally on all the levels involved.                        </div>

You are absolutely correct.<br/><br/>However, there is a middle ground, and that's the Actual Play that you describe. In my aforementioned Mark C's descriptions of TSOY that I heard him tell others at MACE, he'll say something like this (I'm cutting it into components here):<br/><br/>1) "Keys are the coolest part of TSOY. Here's one example."<br/>(average reader knows that keys are a big piece of TSOY, maybe they're not sure of why)<br/><br/>2) "In some ways it makes TSOY into a game that corrects itself."<br/>(ok, average reader is now giving you his ear, thinking about the implications of that)<br/><br/>3) "I had a character take Key X. They then played with that for a while, and then realized it was fucking boring (quick play example given). In a normal game you'd be stuck with your decision. But here, I was able to buy it off, and take Key Z instead, which led to some awesome play (quick play example given). A self-correcting system. That's incredible."<br/>(aha, now average reader/listener has a frame of reference. He hasn't played the game himself yet, but now has experienced secondhand an actual play event or two that solidified the idea above. So it gives him more to look forward to in his own game)<br/><br/>So in the above, sure it's not anywhere near having Mark's actual experience. But his little speech above is definitely a middle point between "reading the rules" and "experiencing it for yourself". <br/><br/>Think of a medical book (none of us are surgeons, but still). <br/>1) Here is a book that describes where all the organs in a body are, and proper surgery techniques.<br/>2) Here is the actual experience of performing several successful surgeries.<br/>That's a big jump there. Medical students spend a lot of time in lectures and tutoring and the like, picking up Actual Play (as it were) from doctors, getting the kinds of lessons that bridge numbers 1 and 2 together until they're ready to take on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not meaning to imply that playing games are like medicine or whatever, but that "bridging effect" between textbook and actually experiencing the event firsthand... there's a huge gap in pedagogy there normally, and I'm personally seeing what I can do to bridge that gap . Japanese roleplaying Replays (the script-format actual play sessions) are one huge step to bridge that gap over in Japan. Those are nice, but I'm also thinking there are other tricks and techniques that can be used to bridge Reading and Experiencing Firsthand...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Yes!  For example, I'm a huge fan of Trollbabe, but I don't like going into too much detail about exactly why I think the game works so well because a lot of what I love about the game did not emerge until I played through it.  I wouldn't want to spoil that surprise for potential players.  Having "it all" come together, on its own - just by following the rules - was a much more powerful experience, I think, than if I had been aiming for the outcome from the beginning because the text told me: "This is what it will look like."                        </div>

                            I'm kinda torn on Andy's statements that texts should try and express more of the emergent stuff of play. On one level, yes, most indie RPG texts aren't written as clearly as they should be, hence all the revisions we see. But my gut reaction is that it's not as simple as you think it is, Andy.<br/><br/>Stuff that runs off of emotional engagement, I'm not sure you can ever really explain that in writing. The Fan Mail thing, sure I can say, "Fan Mail creates a dynamic where players get rewarded for creating stuff that entertains the group, which in turn promotes more of group engagement" (or something like that). But such a statement is always going to feel dry compared with real play.<br/><br/>There are also other considerations when writing a game text. Sometimes you want to purposely leave certain things unsaid. Sometimes you don't want to color pre-conceived notions, so it's easier (better?) to just remain silent. Sometimes, you want there to be room for individual group expression, so again, it's easier to just not say anything. And Sometimes, certain behavior do just manifest themselves, so for the sake of brevity, there's no point in writing them in the text. (People love describing their character in tMW, and since it doesn't effect the mechanics of play, I didn't think it neccessary to bring it up.)<br/><br/>Actually, that and Jon's post above makes me think---if these are emergent features, and if I clearly explain the procedures, why should I bother pointing them out? If players follow the rules, won't they discover it themselves?                        </div>

                            Oh, good point Tim.  I know there's stuff Clinton deliberately left out of TSOY, specifically so that each group could find their own way around it.  Pretty important stuff, actually, like "who gets to say what, when."  You don't actually need that, and I at least didn't notice it's absence - each group I've played TSOY with has found a slightly different balance without any trouble or thought.  So there's a place for omission, for sure.                        </div>

                            Side-point: there's an interesting distinction to be drawn between <i>games you must play to understand the rules</i> and <i>games you must play to understand how they really work</i>.<br/><br/>For example, after reading Best Friends, I understood the rules. But I didn't understand how the game would actually run in practice (it starts with everyone messing around with the mechanics, which leads to bitchiness, and that fuels the narrative, etc, etc).<br/><br/>Text-wise, I think there's also a distinction between mechanic examples-which-show-how-the-rules-work and examples-which-show-the-emergent-features-of-play.

But such a statement is always going to feel dry compared with real play.</blockquote>
I totally agree there, because again the statement is dry and academic.  I'm thinking that types/styles of writing have to be exploited to make it not feel so dry. Specifically, I'm thinking a sidebar which is "One Player's Experience" with the game. Scatter about 10 of these throughout the book. Actually, Ron had something like that in Sex and Sorcery, but his player accounts were all about the content in each individual chapter.  Imagine if you took that kind of narrative example and showed how people had good (or bad) experiences in play through a paragraph or two of juicy narration from someone who played the game?<br/><br/>Hell, Luke does a lot of what I'm describing with his "three heads" dudes in Burning Wheel and Empires.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not faulting indie RPGs here, the canvas encompasses ALL games. It's just that, with Indie games, we have the opportunity to try new ways of expressing the game text that couldn't be done as easily in traditional games (Freelancer: "I was thinking of a bunch of sidebars which talk about people's experience playing the game"; Producer: "Sorry, we've got a deadline to meet, not enough money, and besides everyone will just understand the game anyway"). There's less of a stigma of trying new ways to explain to the potential player the kinds of things they could be getting out of the game.
<blockquote>If players follow the rules, won't they discover it themselves?</blockquote>
It's a gamble.<br/><br/>I didn't pick out the fact that the color Red meant "Danger" in The Sixth Sense until someone came out and told me.  My next viewing of the movie was made much better because someone told me to look for that interesting element ahead of time.<br/><br/>I've been in mystery games where the GM leaves clues "everywhere" (in their mind), and yet we players simply don't connect the dots in the way the GM is trying to get us to. Which is frustrating for both of us until the GM comes right out and says what we should be looking at.<br/><br/>If you're willing to take the gamble that for every, say 6-10 groups who play your game, one of the groups will have a bad time of it their first time around because they didn't know where to focus their attention, then that's totally fine. But I'm thinking that there are the tools laying around out there that can help reduce this number (it'll never get to 0, but y'know, maybe a nice fat parabolic curve).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            II'm going to suggest that we're talking about different kinds of "understanding" here. There's a cognitive level of appreciation and there is a gut level of experience. The trick is that the two work together much more than we often acknowledge, and so different levels of "knowing" happen from learning something, experiencing something, or from doing both together. <br/><br/>To take this to a non-RPG context for a moment: I just traveled to India with Mo after I'd spent 10 years studying Indian history, politics, and religion. We spent a lot of time in India with people she was working with as well, who had a very different take on India than either of us did as we were both there to experience it. <br/><br/>In the first week I was in India I learned absolutely nothing that I had not already known. However, I learned a huge amount that I had never felt. All the intangibles became tangible and gut punched me so hard that I was often left (literally) breathless. My understanding and experience of India is now on a whole different plane than it was before. <br/><br/>Mo, otoh, had been trying to study India for the few months before we left, and was having a hard time remembering all the strange names and bizarre concepts. Then we got there, we got down in it, it got her in the gut and suddenly it became clear in her head. She both learned and felt in India, and as a result came ot understand it where she'd had no real knowledge of it at all before. She ended up on the same page with me about India, but her initial experience of it was very different. <br/><br/>Many of the people we were working with, OTOH, never tried to learn about India. They only experienced it, only felt the culture shock without any understanding of what was behind it. They came away with an understanding of India all right, but it was very different than mine and very different than Mo's -- because they had gotten only one side of the knowing. <br/><br/>So, back to game: A well described game text can give you cognitive appreciation of what is going on in the game, but it won't give you that gut level feeling of it. In some games with rigorous and straight-forward systems this isn't always important, as the experience of playing the game is pretty much exactly what you might think from you cognitive understanding. In other games, however, the gap between the two kinds of knowing can be massive.<br/><br/>Look, for example, at the Pool. If you read the Pool it seems like there is hardly anything there. There isn't a lot to cognitively appreciate, as the whole thing takes up like one page of not-small font text and is completely straightforward. But when you play the Pool and get down into it and have Idea rolls flowing and people blowing their whole pool and screaming in horror at the ruin that is their character, you get a whole different level of appreciation of the game. <br/><br/>So what I think Andy is talking about is games that, for whatever reason, don't even give you a proper cognitive understanding of the game before you start. This is a problem, and real big one, and I think we can all admit that. What Jason is talking about, otoh, is games that you can understand cognitively with no problem, but when you get to the gut level of understanding from actual play get that experience like I had in India -- everything you knew abstractly kicks you in your gut and makes you feel it very concretely.                        </div>

                            Brand said what I was going to say, but I've got an example, so ha!<br/><br/>I like <i>Primetime Adventures</i>' fanmail economy.  It's very slick.  Here's how I talk about it to people who have never played before:<br/><br/>You know how in the best games you play people are throwing compliments around?  When someone does something awesome, someone else will comment about how awesome it is.  And you know how this helps you as a player to figure out what the other people at the table think is awesome so that you can make that happen more often?  Well, PTA is set up so that in order for the game to work right you <i>have</i> to toss that feedback around.  If you fail to tell people when they're doing awesome stuff, then the game slows down until you start doing it.  That's why fanmail is so dang cool: it makes you pay attention to what's going on and tell people when they're rocking your world instead of silently observing and enjoying.  It ups engagement.<br/><br/>Then, if they're thinking about running a game, I'll add:<br/><br/>Oh, and this isn't in the text (at least not 1st edition), but it's important: because the fanmail pool comes from spent budget, the Producer should open up every session with a big scene.  Drop lots of budget and ham it up.  You've got to do this to 'prime the pump' of the fanmail economy.<br/><br/>And sometimes I'll toss in:<br/><br/>Another great thing about the fanmail system is that it makes you look for oppurtunities to compliment people.  I think most people have experienced that perception thing where looking for positive things helps you find them where you wouldn't have before.  The fact that people are looking for reasons to give out fanmail means that the players tend to have a more positive view of what happens at the table than they might have had otherwise.<br/><br/>All this stuff is stuff I learned first at the gut level, and some of it (like the priming the pump thing) I had to struggle to figure out.  Now that I have a good handle on it at the cognitive level I enjoy the game even more than I did when things were just 'emergent'.  If someone had sat down and explained how this stuff worked then I would probably have only needed a single session to get the gut-level stuff figured out because I would have had a sort of road map.  Without that explanation it took me way longer to fully understand and enjoy what was going on.<br/><br/>That said, I <i>did</i> learn just by playing.  The social structure created by the game mechanics did become apparent over time because I was looking for it.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            For me it was probably most evident with Dogs. <br/><br/>I mean, I knew I was going to like Dogs. I knew how raising and seeing and escalating worked, and how it made characters make hard choices. <br/><br/>Then I actually played and saw the unleashed carnage and emotional brutality escalating out of control at every turn, watched PCs in an RPG reel back terrified of the violence they had unleashed, and felt the gut churning anticipation of staring down a raised pair of 10s and realized that there was even more to it than I'd known.                        </div>

                            I'm ambivalent on this one, for a couple of reasons. First, I think there's lots of merit in presenting the rules of the game in a very dry mechanical form, and letting people discover the feel in play, because if you clutter your text with "Why the game works with this rule" that can often make the reading harder, and people miss the actual "how to" that's critical. In a purist sense, I'd say that I personally prefer very little explanation of "why it works" and just lay out the procedures for me.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, RPGs have those moments where people have to make decisions on when to use the mechanics and other just judgments. As Matthew's example points out, circumstances of play might lead to the wrong conclusions about these things if the text doesn't instruct on these judgments to some extent. So I also understand the POV that says that we should explain better.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem, however, that it's almost a contradiction in terms to be explicating an "intangible" isn't it? I mean we call them intangibles precisely because it's so hard to put your finger on just what they are. Trying to describe them might be as confusing, or more confusing than refraining.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover...a lot of this amounts to "write better explanations." Which is a hell of a lot easier said than done.<br/>
<br/>
Andy does have some interesting ideas that might work. Actually I'm personally for laying out the procedures sans commentary in one section, and then later having a section on design notes that explains why things are designed as they are, and what the design intends to do. Note that this is precisely what the designers of wargames do, and it seems to be pretty effective.<br/>
<br/>
That's a flawed analogy, of course, since wargames have no judgment calls. The one place where you do need to have examples and explicate in RPG texts are where the ambiguities of participant choice arise. If the rule itself doesn't make crystal clear what the player prerogatives are about, then you have to at least give some inkling. These textual clues are akin to the "strategy tips" you sometimes see in some non-RPG rulesets, where they say something like, "Note that it's often best to simply do X here, but there may be exceptions..."<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a fine line. I'm quite sure it's just as possible to over-explain as it is to under-explain. I'm also just as sure that the latter occurs far more than the former, because it's easier to just hope that the players will put the mechanics into action and "Get it." But if you go into it with an eye toward setting the level correctly, I think you're doing about all you can to try to make the game as understandable as possible in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
Because you can't just will yourself to be a better writer. And, worse, what's clear to one reader is fuzzy to another. So there's no system out there that's so clear that you'll never have to give any clarifications. Just do the best you can with it.<br/>

                            So, I don't necessarily have this problem with a game in general, but I almost always have trouble understanding the conflict resolution system, no matter what the game.  Mostly I think this is because there's lots of choosing appropriate skills, figuring out how many dice to roll, your opponent figuring out what they're going to do, and then what the results mean.  This means that I didn't understand D&amp;D until I'd played it a lot because it focuses on combat.  I understood Polaris almost right away (except for the exhausting themes) because it involves less totalling of stuff and fewer "conflict actions" (i.e. I only have a few phrases to choose from rather than 25 skills, two weapons, plus my dex or strength).  It's just part of how my brain works and my style of role-playing.<br><br>--Nancy                        </br></br></div>

                            Great stuff in this thread. One thing I notice with a lot (not all) of these is that play involves some tactile element - the pools of MURPG, the fan mail of PTA, etc.  I don't think that's an accident.  The more different ways there are to learn something the more likely someone is to learn it and be able to explore it (and strategize it).  You can get acculturated to die rolling and strategizing is all mathematics.  But pushing fan mail chips or red and blue stones around a table is a very different beast.                        </div>

                            JD<br><br>Same deal with dice in Dogs, I think. I mean thinking about a raise with some 10s is cool, but the feel of putting those dice out on the table is sort of like the feel of putting two slugs into a doublebarrelled shotgun.                        </br></br></div>

<b>On what's been said:</b><br><br>I'm new to this thread, but I do need to say that everything Andy's been saying may as well have come out of my own mouth as well.  Over at Evil Hat, we are explanation *fetishists*, (c.f. my examination of the questionnaire in Don't Rest Your Head or, well, nearly all of Spirit of the Century).<br><br>When we started revising Fate for the version that's in SotC, we went down the wrong path a lot.  An absolute ton!  But thanks in great part to Lenny Balsera's involvement, we kept pushing back towards a target of "okay, that may be what you've written, but <b>how do you actually play</b>?"  If the text didn't match the actual play -- if it didn't presage it, underline it, and to a great extent match it, it was something we needed to turn a deep, critical eye towards.  As often as not it ended up with something changing in the text -- or even the system itself -- to better match and illustrate actual play techniques.<br><br>This isn't rocket science, but it is exhausting and time-consuming.  I don't think we can honestly, reasonably expect all games to try to hit that mark.  And sometimes it's a design decision *not* to hit that mark, as I believe has been suggested earlier in the thread.<br><br>But there's a reason why you playtest, beyond simple mechanics validation, that I think gets missed.  IMO, you should be factoring those actual play experiences back into the book.  Examples should be based in things that actually happened in your games.  Realizations that you had about how the game functions should exist in the main text or, at the bare minimum, in sidebars or "behind the curtain" type stuff.<br><br>But you also have to recognize that sometimes folks just won't feel it until they drink whatever flavor of kool-aid you're purveying.  The comments people are making about Dogs in the Vineyard most fully show this to be so.  Dogs definitely hits my "lots of real, actual play, sink-your-teeth-in, see-it-from-all-angles explanations in here" goalpost.  And Vincent wisely stops the explanation right where he does -- right at the doorstep of the door of playing it yourself so, the moment you open that bad boy, the things you can't turn into text, the last few scintillae of game-magic that only ever happen experientially, will hit you square in the eyes.<br><br>As a game designer I feel like it's my responsibility to get players to that doorstep.  Getting them to the same town isn't enough; nor to the neighborhood; nor to the street; not even to the house.  To the <i>doorstep</i>.  That's where it's at.<br/><br/><b>On the original mission of the thread:</b><br/><br/><i>Dogs</i> is amazing because it forecasts all of the incredible stuff you're going to encounter, but still leaves room for you to be amazed when it happens.<br/><br/><i>Exalted</i> has a bewildering array of charms that I find overwhelming -- until I sit down to make a character, and then it's like shopping for candy with a rich man's credit card.<br/><br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> and <i>Sorcerer</i> (among others) both have powerful setting reinforcement tools dressed up as standard, "generic" RPG features -- keys and descriptors, respectively.  Once you see them in play, you sit up and realize that they are where the setting lives, not in some dusty thick tome of endless paragraphs of trivia.<br/><br/><i>Mortal Coil</i>'s prices on magic -- creating setting on the fly, but never truly fully controlling what you add -- man, it creates real-feeling, new-smelling, exciting magical laws for your universe, and in reading the text, man, you can just gloss right past 'em and not realize you've just seen the most important thing in the book.  Similar things *could* be said about the passions, I think, but I haven't done any long-term Mortal Coil play, so this is more theory than observed data.<br/><br/><i>Rolemaster</i>'s brutal damage system, with its wacky crit tables and chances of sudden, ugly, hilariously untimely death looks like a fun read but lousy play until it gets in motion -- and then you see its nastiness turn bold cinematic heroes into devious, sneaky, let-do-it-quick-and-skip-the-fighting Black Company type mercenaries.  Say what you will about it, but *man*, that's another powerful setting tool built in right there that you end up experiencing as you play it.<br/><br/><i>Agon</i>'s ideas of the range strip and it mattering whether you have dice in your left or right hand can seem a little bizarre on the reading of it, but when you take it into play, you realize that these are <i>best fit</i> tools for putting you in the moment.  Swinging your sword and blocking with your shield by rolling dice from the same hands that hold those implements in-character?  Awes-- er, fantastic.  Strategic mastery of range being a crucial, yet abstracted aspect of battlefield play?  Rock on.<br/><br/><i>Dictionary of Mu</i>'s advice -- which I've dubbed "The DelRosso Directive" -- to "kick this setting in the teeth" looks really good on paper.  I think it's one of those "doorstep" phrases.  It puts me right on the cusp of having my realization just before I get in there and do my actual play.  But how *powerful* that directive is is in no way apparent until you really do kill a god, lay waste to a major city, destroy a faith, free the rage of a dead world, cause the planet Mercury to wink out of existence, and cast a messiah into ruin -- all in the first two sessions of play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            It's weird when I read on of these threads and realize that everyone has a different idea of the subject than I do.<br/><br/>I see as a significant dichotomy between emergent features of games and situations where you need someone who's played it to explain it to you.  The former usually portends well for the quality of the design, since you get a higher ratio of good-experience to rules count.  The latter I tend to think of as a flaw: "* designer not included."  My experience with several well-thought-of games has been very much the latter, and to a limited degree they're the ones that might benefit from greater levels of explanation.  But that also seems not to be what Jason is talking about.<br/><br/>As far as emergents go, there is the slight danger that in reading the text you won't see them at all, and a single sentence point them out is worth it's weight in gold.  My analogy is always to Go, which has 5 rules, which is enough to produce a deep enough game that there are between 40 and 50 ranks of players, where every rank will consistently defeat the rank below it.  But when you're teaching Go to a beginner, you can't stop at the last rule: you have to go on from <i>ko</i> to situations like two eyes and ladders, even though they're "just emergent."<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think what helps most is some quick pointers to the emergent properties of a ruleset.  I think(?) that PtA and TSoY both do this about their respectives, and if they don't they ought to.  Contrariwise, Tony goes on for a whole chapter about the economies in <cite>Capes,</cite> which are a big part of the emergent properties.  But all it really takes is a quick pointer to things you should expect out of play, not an endless belaboring of how cool they'd be if you'd only play with them.                        </div>

I totally agree with the first part.<br/><br/>The thing with board games, though, is that you have EVERYTHING you need to play on the equivalent of like two pages of text. You can buy a board game, open it up, and play it right there as you follow the rules. Emergent stuff will come up fast and hard, sweeping everyone off their feet. By the rules of a boardgame, it's really hard to fuck up or play it in a way the author didn't intend.  This is very much not the case with tabletop RPGs.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            hah - we've (my and my girlfriend) are missing decent 2-player games and been thinking about either getting into chess or getting a Go board. But they're both just so intimidating. I'm thinking Go, on the rationale that if I ever wanted to play anyone else, with Chess anyone willing probably already plays and thus will obliterate me, whereas I can probably pick up Go games with casually interested players. (Of course, this pattern would be reversed in, say, China.)                        </div>

Actually, I disagree.  Provided that _both players_ have only that sheet of rules, play can be quite awesome, and will end up playing in the romantic style which is, honestly what most chess-players-but-not-enthusiasts are trying to do (and which served as the basic model for chess play through the 17th or 18th century).  It's only when you have one player who is more versed in the more contemporary schools of thought that things get broken, and quickly, because the guy who does know about openers, board control and so on is going to end up squashing the other guy, repeatedly.<br/><br/>Put another way, to say that just playing is the loosest definition of chess is a disservice to the players and the game.  There's more to discover, and depths to be plumbed, but without doing those things it <b>still works well</b>, and thank god for that, because otherwise it probably would have joined the ranks of other forgotten boardgames.<br/><br/>(That said,  the sheer volume of chess lore, and the history of _how_ these changes have come tobe eis pretty fascinatignin its own right, and it's a mania that has pretty clear analogs in the RPG community, and if any of you RPG folks who like looking at chess thoughtfully have not yet read Shenk's <i>Immortal Game</i>, you're doing yourself a disservice.)<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Rob,<br/><br/>But I think Tony's point, in the context of this thread, is valid.  You could read the rules to chess but all the nuances of the game aren't going to become apparent until you actually sit down to play and see how cool having a supported knight in the center squares really is.  The rules are complete and sufficient but there are some things you just don't get until you sit down and see the rules in action.                        </div>

                            Sure, but the counterpoint - that it's playable and enjoyable _without_ discovering these things underscores a key point.  You don't need to learn those thigns to "get" chess - you can do that out of the box.  There is just a long, promising and (hopefully) rewarding array of new things that can unfold ahead of you which is, itself, and unending process.  All the nuances of chess will, honestly, _never_ make themseves known, and tend<br/><br/>You can have one without the other, but chess kicks ass by doing both well. <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Hah, just kidding, I had to drop that bomb.

                            Rob, <br/><br/>And yet none of that fun from chess is going to be obvious when you just read the rules -- be they one page or three books. You don't get why chess is fun until you actually play. However, ironically, how you play and how you try to have fun will be vastly changed by which books and rules you've read before you come to the board. No one survives their first introduction to chess without it effecting the way they play the game. <br/><br/>P.S. This is where I make my Willpower check and don't go on rant about the history of chess and the nature of mentorship and learning in early chess development and how it mirrors the shift in learning about games from mentorship to book that we've seen in RPG circles online.                        </div>

                            Hmm, are strategies "emergent" behavior? All that stuff with Chess is really tactics &amp; strategies.<br/><br/>I <i>want</i> to say that tactics are something slightly different...<br/><br/>When I think "emergent" I think of a behavior or experience that everyone or almost everyone has or does. But tactics are optional, that is, there are a variety of tactics you can choose from...<br/><br/>What do y'all think of that?                        </div>

                            Tim:  I dunno.  People use the word "tactics" in different ways.  For instance, I have a "Tactics and Strategy" section in <i>Capes</i>, and I will tell you straight up that the stuff in that chapter is <b>not optional</b>.  It's how the game is going to end up working.                        </div>

                            Well...Game Theory is all about how the rules of the game cause behaviors. Strategies are precisely the response behaviors to the rules.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are some "optimal strategies" that everyone follows (usually becuase they're obvious). I think this is what you're referring to, Tim.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the array of strategies that people can employ in situations where the best strategy isn't known are, in fact, an emergent quality of the game. But so are the optimal strategies, yes.<br/>
<br/>
I mean this quite literally, from a Game Theory POV. That is, let's take the game Feng Shui, with it's rule that you get penalized if you announce an action in a boring or repetitive manner. Everybody knows that the single way to respond to this is to make your announcements fun and innovative, and (when enforced), the rule produces the desired result by giving better rewards to the player when he follows the desired behavior. While the color of the announcement has no effect itself on the outcome of the game, the selection of that color has a mechanical effect, and so even color is affected by system.<br/>
<br/>
Often this is less obviously mechanical. Subjective "roleplaying rewards" for instance. Or even just the group's social reinforcement schedule. But, insamuch as these behaviors are the result of the structure that the group decides to use, I think you can say that it's an emergent property of those structures.<br/>
<br/>
Mike<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Where the term "Strategy" is well defined in Game Theory, the term Tactics is less used, or ommitted entirely. When used it generally means a strategy used to solve for a short portion of an overall game. In that context, then, Strategy means a plan to employ certain tactics in sequence where possible. In fact the term "Strategic Move" refers to a move early in the game that intends to fix the game situation later so that only certain strategies will work then (these could be called tactics, too).                        </div>
