The emerging story is guided by a set of mechanics that guide the players to create the story.<br/><br/>JeepForm, on the other hand, tends to have quite a good grasp of the story before the play begins. There is no emergent story as such and no mechanics; the players explore the story (or framework of the story) already there with a host of techniques at their disposal. There's a very good and more verbose introduction to the JeepForm inside the <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt/" rel="nofollow">Doubt</a>-package.<br/><br/>Like, roughly and looking at the ends of both spectrums. I might have gotten in backwards on either accounts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70908/#Comment_70908" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T14:40:20+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  2:40PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I see.

No two game of "doubt" will ever be the same, and not only for the different dialogue. There are different characters, locations, and most of all different themes (different answers to the premise generate different thems). Our game was about regret, commitments and fears.  Another could easily be about dependance, abuse and self-worth.  It's really a game that can be played multiple times by the same players.<br/><br/>I reminded me a lttle of PTA (it even has a sort of "Pitch" at the beginning), and of the Mountain Witch. But with the kind of "in character" immersion of a live game. <br/><br/>Really, from the two games I played ("Doubt" and "the upgrade") and from the presentation and the reading of the jeepform "truths", they don't seem to me any less "narrativistic" than DitV or Carry. These are the "live games" techniques equivalents of a lot of narrativist table-top rpg techniques.<br/><br/>In some way, jeepform are even more advanced!! I don't know if you read Vincent Baker's <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=146" rel="nofollow">Dangerous idea for 2006</a>. about making narrativist games that "smashes character ownership". Well, "The Upgrade" is that game. Made as a LARP. <br/><br/>I have seen in the download section of the site some old jeepform games that aren't so narrativists, and in thir "truths" they talk about "a message or a premise" like they are the same thing, but in both "Doubt" and "The Upgrade" you clarly have a premise (a question), and not a message (the answer)<br/><br/>But what the jeepen do with these techniques is NOT the issue at all:  People, in the middle of these "truths" there are techniques that you can use to make narrativist larp games YOURSELF!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
