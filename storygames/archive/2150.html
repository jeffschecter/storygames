                    I hope this is in the right forum. Anyway, here goes.<br/><br/>I'm going to be running TMW as a oneshot in a week or two, and I think I may have painted myself into a corner. I've run the game twice (once to completion in three sessions) so I know TMW takes time to cook the characters and their relationships up to the boiling over point. But this time I've only got a 4-hour slot to work with and somehow I want to get to the good stuff right quick.<br/><br/>Anyone have any tips for really picking up the pace with this game?                </div>

                            Fewer players. Try to make the cutoff for the game 4 players.  Every additional player past three adds a geometric scale of "Time required in play in order to get a good roleplaying payoff".  Just to show, Eric regularly runs 6-hour one-shots of TMW with 6 players or so.<br/><br/>That's probably the most critical/important step you can take.  With 3, I still think you can get The Payoff (though again, it would be better in a longer session). With 6 in 4 hours... You might have to change the game up a bit. Set stricter scenes, force the gameflow, maybe group the samurai into teams/alliances/clans.<br/><br/>But see if you can lock down the player count to a smaller number first.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I've never run tMW as anything <i>but </i>a one-shot, myself, and never had a problem going from zero to blood opera in four hours, for four players.  The game's act structure provides a built-in pacing mechanism - prepare one minor and one major scene per act, making sure it involves/implicates everyone (easier with a smaller group), have a few challenges in reserve, and budget extra time for the end showdown.  Make it clear to your players that there is really no time to be coy about their secrets and motivations.<br/><br/>I know this is playing the game wrong, but it has worked for me.  A proper, multi-session game has been on my "to do" list for a long time.                        </div>

                            Though I don't like encouraging short games, I have conceded that people are just going to keep running one-shots. So here's the rough draft of my clarification that I was working on for my website. Mind you, this is *rough* draft. I would love feedback from people, either questions or additional tips.<br/>________________<br/><br/>In a recent email someone asked me about running a Con game:
<blockquote>But it's only a four-hour time slot and I was wondering if you had any tips for running a one-shot of this game with new players?  I am coming with pregen characters and will give a quick overview of the game beforehand.  But I want to give the players a fighting chance to make it to the end of the game and was curious about proper pacing.</blockquote>
The simple-but-not-easy answer is you have to REALLY concentrate on player-authored (ie, fate-related) content. This is involves two things.<br/><br/>The first is you have to push, Push, PUSH! for exposition. In other words, you have to push the players to generate material. This is really important in the early parts of the game. Do a lot of what Eric Provost (who has GM'ed tMW almost as much as I have) calls the â€œfishingâ€ technique---asking the players to define game elements for you, like, "You're in a graveyard, and your character recognizes the name on one of the headstones. It was someone important to you. Who was it?" <br/><br/>You also have to generate scenes with the express purpose of allowing exposition. Like, sometimes I throw in dream sequences. I let the player frame it, and then I twist it to somehow make reference to the Witch. But the whole purpose is to let the player generate content. I usually try and plan for a scene that targets each of the PCs individually in this regard (this sometimes works better after the players start generating their own material, see below).<br/><br/>I also just try and get the players talking---about life, their goals, their past, why they are engaged with the adventure, or whatever. I usually do this by having NPCs ask the players questions. Sometimes I introduce a benign or ambiguous NPC---my favorite is a monk who spouts pseudo-Buddhist ideals about the Witch and/or life in general. I try and engage the players in this conversation. This sort of thing works well with non-serious or â€œinnocentâ€ spirits as well. I often have NPCs who are about to fight talk the PCs first before the battle. I tend to introduce talky NPCs in almost every scene of a con game.<br/><br/>In the early part of the game, you really need to try and extract at least one little piece of info from each of the players in EVERY scene. Depending on how readily players generate Fate-related material, sometimes this involves targeting specific players. Like, when I present the monk, if one or two of the players are being quiet, I have the monk ask them questions specifically.<br/><br/>The second step is you have to really start using the material that the players give. Keep bringing the stuff they introduce back and back again. Build it up.  In the early parts of the game its OK for you to introduce situations and NPCs that you made up. But the later part of the game should involve nothing but stuff the players introduced.<br/><br/>And realize that anything the players introduce are your's to play and mess with. As Eric Provost said in a thread at Story-Games awhile ago, <br/><br/>â€œThat was someone's brother buried in that graveyard? Awesome. Now try to figure out who was romantically involved with the brother, who betrayed him, who put a knife in his back, etc... [Use the stuff players introduce to] connect people in the most horrible ways. A character suddenly reveals that she's really at the castle to meet up with her long lost lover and captive to the witch? Great! Now make that long lost lover the guy who betrayed, killed, and was romantically involved with the dead brother. Watch the sparks fly when that information is revealed.â€<br/><br/>Because of the time constraint, you really have to cut to the action. Meaning, you really have to push â€œdramaticâ€ situations. You don't want to avoid violence, but try and introduce â€œdramaâ€---talking, fate- &amp; trust-related, etc.---in every scene. Try and give the monsters personalities, rather than make just be mooks. Use really aggressive scene framing to put them right in the action. But still give the PCs â€œbreatherâ€ moments like I suggest in the book. Those are important.<br/><br/>Con games are difficult, because they have to be so off-the-cuff. You can prep the early scenes, but the later half of the game tends to be totally on-the-fly. You just can't predict what the players will author themselves.<br/><br/>Other time saving tips are important too. I'm not sure pre-gens are the way to go, but it might help if list you list a whole bunch of possible abilities with the caveat that players can add more of their own. I usually limit the number of Abilities to 2, that saves a little time in chargen. Another tip from Eric is to explain Abilities this way: Each character has one unspoken ability, "Do samurai stuff." Now, what are some things your character can do that you wouldn't automatically think a samurai could do?<br/><br/>Don't worry about explaining the system ahead of time. Explain as you go as the need arises. You can read the Con Demo I have on my website to get some tips in this regard.<br/><br/>Eric also has this to say about Fates: â€œMake sure that everyone is very familiar with all of the Fates and has a good idea of what they could do with each and every one of them before you deal them out. This way you can head-off that situation where a player is totally stumped by what they're supposed to do with their card.â€<br/><br/>You may also want to consider limiting the number of players, maybe to 4. IME, each additional player adds complexity exponentially. And while complexity is fun, it also means more time for sorting through it all. Playing with more players is certainly possible, just more difficult push through in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>Lastly, a word about time. I, personally, find it REALLY difficult to push a game through in 4 hours. The shortest game I've ever run is 4.5 hours. If you have the time, I think a 6 hour time slot is alot more realistic and managable. Most of my con game runs in 5-6 hour range. You still have to all the stuff I've mentioned, but there's alot less pressure.                        </div>

<p>The first time I ran anything for Remi was when we met at MACE in 2005.  I'd set up for a 6 hour &amp; 6 player game of tMW, but only got 3 players.  Including Remi.  We ran through at what felt like a natural pace.  It took us about two and a half hours and had a quality ending.</p>
<p>I think I can attribute at least part of that break-neck pace to dumb luck.  When I ran that particular session I was still pretty shaky with my tMW skillz, and kinda applied the pacing that we'd been using for The Shab-al-Hiri Roach.  The 'breather' scenes that Tim is fond of?  They never happened in that session.  It was high-paced go-team-go action all the way to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>One of the things I regularly do now is to explain the situation to my convention players right out the gate.  Like; "Hey, this game was designed for 16-20 hours of play.  We're gonna do it in 6.  So that means that you can't sit there and wait for stuff to happen.  You need to grab this game by it's horns and make shit happen.  90% of the awesome in this session is up to you."  That usually does the trick.  Usually an hour after that little speech the players are dropping shit on each other that I could never have come up with on my own.  Then all I have to do is grab hold of what they've made for me and run with it.</p>
<p>But my real and final bit of advice is this;  Play at the pacing that's comfortable for you and is likely to give you the most awesome in the 4 hours you've got.  If your ronin never get to the castle, much less the witch, but still had a good time fucking with each other on the way up the mountain, then you've run a good game.  They'll probably spend all night talking about the things they were <em>planning</em> on doing to each other but never quite got around to.  Which is almost, if not just as, awesome.</p>

                            Thanks guys, and thank you Tim, these ideas are very helpful! So armed, I'm sure the game is going to run like a top-fuel dragster doing the quarter mile! :-)<br/><br/>Eric, your "We're gonna drive this bitch!" speech is going to come in very handy. ;-)<br/><br/>One thing I know I'll do is drop the Aokigahara-jukai (forest) sequence I use for the first act, and just get everyone straight to the base of the mountain.<br/><br/>Thanks again everyone!<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

<p>Oh, hey.  I nearly forgot.  There's this prep-thing I did for GenCon that really helped me shave a couple minutes off of character generation.  For high-speed convention play I really recomend it.</p>
<p>First, I narrowed down the twelve possible zodiacs to just six.  If you look closely at the relationships between the different animals, you'll see that there are really two different sets of six interlocking relationships.  Just write down all the zodiac names and draw lines between the ones that have relationships.  You'll see what I mean.  I kept the six that included the Dragon in their matrix of enemy/ally, which I think included monkey, rat, dog, horse, and one other.  That gave me the advantage of less choice = less time taken and guaranteed that everyone would have some relationships to start.</p>
<p>Then I took those six character sheets and wrote, at the top of each page, the name of a different color.  Like "purple" at the top of the Dragon sheet, "green" at the top of the Dog sheet, etc.  The colors all corresponded to the six different colors of poker chips I had available.  At the same time, I partially filled out the name &amp; trust block at the bottom of each page.  I wrote in the zodiac sign, the starting trust, and the color of chips that the other players would have.  Dig?  So, once a player chose a character sheet I could have them grab the color chip I assigned them.  Which would allow them to quickly identify the other players who they'd have an initial character relationship with, and their enemies and allies could also identify them as quickly.</p>
<p>It may not sound like much, but the tedium of figuring out just who is who's enemy or ally at the beginning of a convention game is a huge time sucker.  It gets in the way of jumping into the game way too much for my taste.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, when I used this method the players used it as an easy way to illustrate background relationships between their characters.  I was entertained with repeated declarations of <em>"I will have my vengance against the Clan of the Purple Monkey!!"</em></p>

                            Part of my time issue may just be my own personal GM'ing style. I can be... let's say <i>thoughtful</i>. I usually like taking a little time to consider my options. A moment here and a moment there adds up. Further more, I have no problem handing a situation over to the players and then literally sitting back and waiting for them to respond.<br/><br/>I also do the color thing. I actually went out and bought matching dice to go with my poker chips. It helps when I run my demo. (I've debated finding some cheap poker chips and offering a set for sale.)                        </div>

                            Funny thing with the dice/poker chips technique -- my players totally decided to do this on their own.  I got up to go to the bathroom when everyone was figuring out which dice they were going to use, and when I came back they'd color-coordinated themselves. <br/><br/>Anyway, I think Eric's idea of figuring out the players' starting Trust relationships ahead of time is a really good one.  In my game doling out trust took longer than it should've, because we had people going, "Ok, I'm a Monkey.  Does anyone have [insert ally sign here]?" all around the table.                        </div>

                            Hi Mike,<br/><br/>I haven't run a lot of Mountain Witch games, but I like running it, as Mountain Witch is a game that I can run successfully with no prep. I am a low to no prep GM. <br/><br/>Much of the game is in those cards. What I've done is if I have *experienced MW players, which I have so far, I let them know that by scene two they need to start using their ability to grab the narrative to set up their cards. This gives unfamiliar folks a chance to see that part of the game in action. Helping to show them what they are expected to do. I think this also helps focus in their minds that the cards are an important part of the game, and gamers being gamers they focus on that. Throw in a couple of party splits and opportunities to later betray each other and the game is on it's way.<br/><br/>Another thing I do which may or may not have an effect is reduce the number of abilities they can have to two.<br/><br/>*experienced means they have played before.                        </div>

                            Next weekend I'm running a con game of TMW (four-hour slot, six players, alternate setting) and I really appreciate all of these good ideas.  Special thanks to Timothy for answering my questions about the game, especially regarding mapping an alternate setting.  I'll let everyone know how the game turns out!                        </div>

                            Ran my TMW oneshot last night and it kicked significant amounts of ass!! The players were in there swinging, there was lots of good interaction and the betrayals, when they came, knocked everyone flat!<br/><br/>I'm working on a pretty substantial AP, mostly focusing on how I set things up to move fast.<br/><br/>I gotta say TMW does work quite well in a 4 hour format; if anything, the time pressure puts more pressure on the Dark Fates and brings things to a boil right quick!<br/><br/>Super-mega-awesome!<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Just play The Donjon Witch instead, like Tim ran for us at ForgeMidwest.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's what you think it is. My favorite part was the spirit of the mother of the dwarf character coming out of the swamp to spank him. :-)<br/>
