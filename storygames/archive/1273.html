                    In another thread, I proposed that the final outcome of a story-game is a story, and that the story--i.e., whatever happened in the shared imaginary space--that emerges is, y'know, a story.  And that this story isn't much different than the story found in a movie, or a novel, or two people talking on the street about what happened to them.  This apparently is a controversial opinion, so I'm giving it its own thread.  (But I can't stay to argue it very much, because I have a ton of non-gaming things to do today.)<br/><br/>Thesis One: if you gave someone a "blind taste test" between the <i>imaginary</i> events from a jammin' game session, and a snippet from a published novel or movie, the taste-tester wouldn't be able to say, "Gee, the first one is from a game session."<br/><br/>Thesis Two: from the perspective of "creative output," playing a story-games differ from novel writing, film-making, and other creative endeavor mainly in terms of the procedures involved.  While it's true that the players control and savor the story they create, and (hopefully) very much enjoy the process itself, it's not much different in that regard from acting, writing, whatever.                </div>

                            I am not sure if my comments are worth anything but here goes. <br/>
<br/>
Who is the story supposed to entertain? The players right?<br/>
<br/>
So they story only has to be engaging/interesting/cool(insert your chosen adjective) to the players who are currently playing the game. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone else in the world might well think the story sucks, but who cares, it served its purpose. It was engaging for the time of play. <br/>
<br/>
I think most story-game games embrace this, even if they dont intend to. <br/>
<br/>
I know of no games off the top of my head that intentioally try to force the players to create a story that would be "good" outside the context of the game. <br/>

                            Joshua, yes, that's the thread.  Let's take the imaginative content of a game session.  I'm going to call that an RPG-story.  And let's take the plot summary of a novel: I'll call that a novel-story.  Let's say you're told both stories, but can't see the creative processes that went on.  How would you pick out which used an RPG-situation?                        </div>

                            Rayston, those are very good comments!

Totally.  But I suspect that is partially because nobody really expects the story to be told to non-players, at least not very widely.  I've noticed a lot of story-games have all kinds of procedural tricks to help with pacing, character development, setting creation, and so on.  The immediate goal is to make the experience of <i>play itself</i> more fun--but some of these innovations also seem to lead to more consistently entertaining stories as a result, or better genre emulation, or whatever.                        </div>

                            That would be an interesting game, that actually made it a goal for the end story to be "good" outside of play. Im not sure what purpose that would serve, but I suspect that an interesting game could come about if that was one of your design goals. <br/>

I tend to agree, even if it wasnt the designers or players goal. <br/><br/>I cite PTA as an example of a game that seems to result in an interesting story outside of play. Notice the rather common comment of "Id watch THAT TV show"<br/><br/>Thanx<br/><br/>Rayston                        </div>

There are a few other places where the artist and the audience are the same, like a group of friends getting together to jam on their guitars and bongos arounf a campfire.  Or dancing.  But none of the examples I can think of are <i>narrative</i> art forms, which does make our hobby kind of odd.                        </div>

Exactly--because you're <i>creating</i> the story, and from a creator's standpoint, it's pretty hard to look past the act of creation.  How much effort was put in for benefits received?  But I'm specifically asking about the story as an output of play.  Whether it's your main priority or not, it still exists.
<blockquote>The audience for the game and it's players are identical sets - or at least oughtta be.</blockquote>
Who says?  It's certainly not logically inherent in the activity--lots of writers can't get published, and are the only ones who can savor their own work.  The fact that there are virtually no "non-participant audience members" for RPG's is an accidental by-product of RPG culture, not the activity.  Personally, the only time I played PTA, I was very sad that our show would never find a wider audience.<br/><br/>You could just as easily cite the defining feature of an RPG as the existence of an arbitration system for settling creative disputes.                        </div>

I think they would be able to tell, because the structural requirements of the different forms impose different constraints on the narrative. A movie basically can't have both well-realized characters and a large cast, because it's just too short. A novel or rpg can. <br/><br/>Games also  tend to have much more complex narrative structures than novels do, because you have many more protagonists and many more lines of conflict -- what would be confusing in a novel can work in a game because each player is holding up a different set of strands. <br/><br/>Games can also work with much flatter and less-well-realized characters than novels can, because the character identification arising from playing a character can carry you "over the hump". Movies do this even better, because cool visuals can work even better at this.                        </div>

For me, it's spin-off of another argument.  Figuring out how stories work, is related to building games that produce better stories.  This is not the same thing as producing games which are more fun to play, but I suspect there's some overlap for most of the people here.                        </div>

I totally agree.  I'm one of a fairly large number of "non-participant audience members" of this RPG: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rpgmp3.com/" rel="nofollow">RPGMP3</a>.<br/>
I think a lot of people would tune in to watch celebrity D&amp;D on cable TV with Steven Colbert, Vin Diesel, Wil Weaton and maybe Puff Daddy, Michael Madsen, and Lindsay Lohan for good measure.  Actually, this idea <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/14/where_are_the_celebr.html" rel="nofollow">was pitched to Comedy Central</a> last year.                        </div>

                            Stories are not the sole domain of Story Games (or Narrativism or Story Now or whatever you want to call it). Any RPG you can play can produce a story, perhaps even a <i>good</i> story to those that hear the "transcript" afterward. I think it's pretty important to recognize this, particularly if you (you in general, not you, James Nostack) <i>are</i> interested in playing or designing or analyzing Story Games so that you understand what it is that Story Games are and why they have value.                        </div>

<blockquote>The audience for the game and it's players are identical sets - or at least oughtta be.  The audience for a novel and its author are usually (although not necessarily) different people.

The Nobilis and Paranoia Lexicons have a good-sized audience outside the players, and plenty of IRC, web forum, and chat games have enthusiastic audiences.                        </div>

                            Matt, totally.  I figure it's mainly a question of which is the best tool for a particular job.  I had the experience of  collaborating on a transhuman sci-fi epic using a traditional RPG, and it required re-writing almost the entire damn game in order to do the things we wanted it to do.  These days, we'd just grab Shock:, which would cost me around $23 and save me (literally) weeks of work and self-doubt.<br/><br/>Neel - those are very sharp observations.  I wish there was a Fyodor Dostoevsky RPG, which could only be played by groups of 40 or more players.  "Roll your lecherous drunk trait, you noxious insect!"                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Any RPG you can play can produce a story, perhaps even a<i>good</i>story to those that hear the "transcript" afterward.</blockquote>
This all goes back to the narratology v. ludology debate that continues to roil in video-game studies.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I land somewhere in the middle - that games are capable of producing a coherent narrative - <i>but only if the narrative artifact produced by the game is extensively edited</i>.  At which point, you have to ask yourself whether you're dealing with a genuine product of the game, or a <i>by-product</i> of the game which is really a product of the editorial process.<br/><br/>A D&amp;D session 'transcript', or any other transcript of a game session, even one utterly devoid of chatter, is full of missteps on the part of the players, setbacks, cul-de-sacs and other narrative run-arounds that may make for a coherent narrative (meaning that a random reader can follow the action), but that the narrative is so unlike anything produced by 'traditional' media that it won't pass a sniff test.  There's just too much chance and too much freedom of action involved in game-machine for it to produce something like what we understand to be a 'story'.<br/><br/>That said, I think that the narratives that are provided by games are a <i>variant form</i> of narrative-as-we-know-it, and one that (given the increasing amount of computing power available) will begin to emerge as a new form of storytelling across media.<br/><br/>But the 'story' from a 'story game' isn't a 'story' as in 'bedtime story'.  It's just not.                        </div>

                            After a bit more thought, I'd pose this (bloated) question to the proponent of the story-game:<br/><br/>Given an absolutely ideal gaming session or series of sessions, what would the end-product of the play of a 'story game' look like?  A play with narration?  An omniscient 3rd person novel?  A radio drama?  What form (or mix of forms) of narrative would the play of a story game (to an outside observer) appear to be?                        </div>
