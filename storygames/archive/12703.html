What is the principle element? Are all bodies infinitely divisible? Does void exist? From where does the moon get its light? What is the Milky Way? What causes a lunar eclipse? What causes the flooding of the Nile? Why is the sea salty? Do plants have souls? How do animals reproduce? What causes sleep and death? Is the soul mortal? Does thought depend on perception? <br/>\n<br/>\nThus far I have focused on the early Greek philosophers known as Presocratics: Thales, Anaximander, Anaximines, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus. The topics for the questions fall into five categories: principles, cosmology, meteorology, biology, and psychology.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI intend to use this game as an innovative method to teach my students about Greek philosophy through a participatory approach, and in fact through an approach similar to that that Greek philosophers themselves engaged in (competitive speech-giving at drinking parties called "symposia"). (The most famous example of this is Plato's dialogue the Symposium.) But I hope that the game will be fun and didactic for anyone interested in Greek philosophy. I have designed the "character" sheets such that they are composed entirely of translations from actual sources (chiefly Aristotle, Diogenes Laertius, and Plutarch) and can be used for further research and study, even outside of the game. In fact, the character sheets have evolved from handouts I have used to summarize the evidence for these people's views in the context of classes I have taught. I hope to make the final version of the game sufficient to function as a textbook for early Greek philosophy, in addition to being a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I need is help with the central mechanic of the game, the resolution of who has told the best story, or rather, given the best explanation or answer in response to one of the questions. (Scientific explanations, as Plato points out in the Timaeus, are a special kind of story telling.) The first thing to understand about this is that the "true" answer (from the perspective of a modern scientist) is irrelevant to the game. The game operates with a coherence theory of truth, as opposed to a correspondence theory. What this means in game terms is that players must construct answers out of the sometimes sketchy and fragmentary evidence of their views as mentioned by ancient sources (e.g. Thales, that everything is water; Heraclitus, that everything is in flux; Parmenides, that all change is impossible; Empedocles, that all visible substances are composed out of ratios of earth, air, water, fire, etc.). They use only concepts available to philosophers at the time and are penalized for anachronisms. The idea is to show how scientific explanations are largely based on assumptions about the nature of the word, and that one can offer quite good explanations that turn out to be false. So an argument that water is the basic element and principle of change because it can change into all the phases of matter, liquid, solid, and gas, is a good argument, even though water turns out not to be an element at all, much less the principle element. (Or is it? Consider the success of fluid dynamics!). Water is a better element to explain change than, say, earth. (Or is it?) To give another example: if a player in the game is  able to argue that the earth is motionless and can neither move locally or rotate on its own axis, and no player is able to come up with a better argument to the effect that it is in motion, then the player arguing that it is not in motion has given a better explanation, even though this is false.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am asking for is feedback on the mechanism described below. As will be obvious, I was inspired by the game mechanism in The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen by James Wallace. I have adapted some of his game ideas in the present game. I would still like to know about any other games which involve competitive story telling. I have been referred to A Penny for My Thoughts and A Thousand and One Nights, and I am studying these games. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut after reading the description below, let me know whether you thing there is a better way to do this. In general, what other mechanisms exist for resolving story-telling competitions? What problems is this mechanism likely to generate? If you can refer me to discussions on this board, or on others, or to published books and games, I would appreciate it. I plan to begin play-testing in September.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a description of play as I currently envision it.<br/>\n<br/>\n0. Each player starts with a character sheet summarizing that philosopher's views, and 5 tokens (coins, go pieces, etc.) The character sheets are written in a 10-point font and take up both sides of an 8.5 X 11 sheet of paper. Each player is given 15 minutes to study the character and make their own notes.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The person playing the chronologically earliest character rolls a die consulting the table of questions about "principles". For example, a character playing Thales just rolled a 3 = "What is the principle of life?".<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Thales may either pass, or advance a token to the middle of the table and attempt to give a 1-minute speech on the topic. Suppose Thales decides to give a speech, and argues that "Water is the principle of life. First, all life comes from seeds, and we see that seeds are wet. Second, embryos develop in a liquid medium. Third, blood is a kind of water, and it is vital to life. Fourth, all life seems to have originated in the sea. Fifth, deprivation of water quickly leads to death."<br/>\n<br/>\n3. After Thales' speech, the next player in chronological order may either pass or advance a token in order to offer a competing speech. If all other players pass, then each of them pays Thales a token. (If all players, including Thales, choose to pass, then athe topic is re-rolled and another question is played.) Suppose Xenophanes decides to give a competing speech, arguing that the principle of life is actually air: "Breath is the principle of all life, and is a kind of air. Water cannot be the principle, because a terrestrial animal surrounded by water will drown, and life will be extinguished. Even animals that live in the water need air, etc."<br/>\n<br/>\n4. After the second speech, all players (except Thales and Xenophanes) vote on whether Xenophanes speech is an improvement upon Thales. If it is not, Thales wins Xeonphanes' token. If it is, Xenophanes wins Thales' token.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The rest of the players each have an opportunity to pass or speak in chronological order. If anyone else (e.g. Pythagoras) is voted to have given a better speech on that topic than the previous winner, that player wins all the tokens wagered on that topic so far (e.g. the tokens won and wagered by Thales after he was voted to have given the best speech on the principle of life). If that player looses, they give their token to the player last voted to have given the best speech on that topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. After all of the players have had an opportunity to speak, the next round begins, and the second player in chronological order (e.g. Xenophanes) rolls a die on the next topic (e.g. Cosmology). Once a topic is selected (e.g. "Are the planets alive and intelligent?"), each player in chronological order (beginning with Thales) has an opportunity to give a speech or pass, as above.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Once all five topics have been played (principles, cosmology, meteorology, biology, and psychology), the players will have accumulated various amounts of tokens. They then proceed in reverse chronological order to pay their tokens to the player they think gave the best speeches all around. The player with the most tokens after this process has won the symposium game. Notice that winning the most tokens throughout the playing of the game gives you the most influence on who else will win the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nMonte<br/>\n<br/>\nMonte Johnson<br/>\nucsd.academia.edu/MonteJohnson                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285546/#Comment_285546" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T13:17:49+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  1:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assume that the game is meant for 5 players as there are 5 tokens and 5 rounds, with each person starting once.  Is that correct?  The post-arguement phase seems unneccesary, should people be motivated by the ability to play kingmaker?   Why not give players 6-7 tokens, play five rounds and give remaining tokens to someone else at the end for best overall arguments - most tokens at the end wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Monte%20Johnson" title="Monte Johnson"><img alt="Monte Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Monte%20Johnson">Monte Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285559/#Comment_285559" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T13:38:55+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  1:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mease19, Thank you for the feedback. First, I was assuming any number of players over three. Each person rolls a die to determine the question in one of the five topics, but the chronologically earliest player always starts, and the latest goes last.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what you say about the post-argument phase is important and interesting. In effect, can't we eliminate step 4 above, so that everybody just gives their speech and then at the end we all vote on who gave the best speech for that round? The problem I was anticipating is that every player would naturally and subjectively think that they have given the best answer, and so award their token to themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf players are not allowed to vote for themselves, what then are they voting for? The second-best explanation? It is true that players are not motivated to be Kingmaker, and so there is no worry that players will always vote for themselves just to accumulate more tokens. In fact, the opposite is the case. A gamist approach would be to always try to give your tokens away so that you have the least to award other players at the end and there are more to be awarded to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I am trying to do is focus the players' minds on whether the stories told or explanations given are better or worse than their predecessors. And so the players that are not in competition in the current phase try to judge, as objectively as possible, whether this speech just given was better than those that went before. Only the other players make that judgment about your own speech.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right that there is no reason to give only 5 tokens. More tokens would probably make players venture to speak out more often and still have a chance to influence the winner at the end of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nsincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nMonte                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285562/#Comment_285562" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T13:47:27+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  1:47PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to take this over to Praxis (linked at the top) which is the SG-affiliated game design forum.

After all, what I am seeking is game design help. Wouldn't it make sense to move the discussion to Praxis once the game has been played (i.e.play-tested) and there is some "practice" of the game to discuss? I am probably in error since I have never posted to this forum, but at present my game is at the extreme theory end of the theoria-praxis spectrum. It is not even possible to revise the rules, because they have not yet been codified for the first play-testing session.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to feedback on the game play mechanism, I am also looking for feedback on a general, abstract, and theoretical level, for example: Do you think that scientific explanations can be treated as stories (and thus simulated in a story game)? Do you know of other games that do this? (E.g. Ergo, which is a neat card game of constructing logically valid proofs). Do the didactic and agonistic aspects of this game come into conflict? (E.g. do you think that playing a game instead of hearing a lecture on Presocratic philosophers would be worse for your understanding of the ideas?) Would it be more fun if the players exchanged characters each round instead of playing the same character throughout (so that you would play Thales and Heraclitus and Parmenides instead of just Parmenides on every topic? And so forth. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you really think I should remove the discussion to another forum I would be happy to do so and thank you for your advice<br/>\n<br/>\nsincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nMonte                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285609/#Comment_285609" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T16:31:36+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  4:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Monte.

A game I imagine you haven't seen, as it was published in Canada in 1987 and is long out of print, is <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24634/the-game-of-wisdom" rel="nofollow">The Game of Wisdom</a>, by George Ghanotakis, PhD. It has a nice structure that makes players decide whether they will answer a question before any of them has given an answer, a requirement that answers include two examples, and a structure for evaluating responses to questions based on whether a player's answer meets a criteria of being plausible, based on fact, or relevant (and not on as subjective a criteria as which player's answer is "best"). It's definitely a rarity, but perhaps you can turn up a copy by contacting the designer, or with a Craigslist post aimed at Montreal or Ottawa. It was published in Ottawa with rules in both English and French. <br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285669/#Comment_285669" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T21:49:35+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  9:49PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monte:<br/><br/>I love this idea! I would be both willing and able to playtest it for you, too - as it happens, I run both the Philosophy Club and the Chess &amp; Games Club at the University of Central Oklahoma, and could certainly round up five bright players from amongst this lot. I only wish they'd let me teach the Ancient Phil course here, but unfortunately a friend of mine in the department gets the gig because his Greek is better, the bastard. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Your mechanic looks pretty solid to me, though I agree with Jonathan that the last round seems a bit <i>ad hoc</i>. I think an improvement would just be to give each player one extra token at the start of the game that they have to keep in reserve and pass to the person they think did best as a little bonus right at the end.<br/><br/>I also worry that the way you've set up character sheets, with direct quotations from sources, would make the game a tad unbalanced based on which philosopher a player got stuck with. I mean, there really isn't much to Thales' cosmology <i>apart</i> from "Everything is Water," but Heraclitus is a lot more elusive, Xenophanes may well have a skeptic about cosmology, and who the hell knows what Anaxagoras was going on about? It would be marginally less scholarly, but much more fun and equitable, to just attach a single simple catchphrase of the form "Everything is ___" to each of these guys (e.g. "Everything is change" for Heraclitus," "Everything is Mind" for Anaxagoras, and so on) to each name. You can always go into more detail and depth about what they really thought in the lectures that you give after the game has been played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Monte%20Johnson" title="Monte Johnson"><img alt="Monte Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Monte%20Johnson">Monte Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285670/#Comment_285670" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T21:49:37+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  9:49PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Paul,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much.

Now I want to combine this with role playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonte                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285672/#Comment_285672" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T21:51:39+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  9:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, a much simpler Philosophy-themed game that I've had some success with in lower-level courses is <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9801/ostrakon" rel="nofollow">Ostrakon</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Monte%20Johnson" title="Monte Johnson"><img alt="Monte Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Monte%20Johnson">Monte Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285674/#Comment_285674" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T22:04:42+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 10:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Lordgoon,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are exactly the kind of person I am looking for-- I will be in touch. I would really appreciate the feedback of one or both of your groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting points you make about the character sheet. Tomorrow when I have access to my other computer I will post an example of the character sheets I am working with. Keep in mind that I want to make the game fun and instructive for people not taking a class from me (or even who have never taken a philosophy class). As you know, the great thing about Greek philosophy-- especially early Greek philosophy-- is that you need not assume any philosophical background, because there was no background! But after I give you some more details you can let me know how much you think what I have will impede or facilitate the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks also for the game suggestion. I'll look around for that one too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMonte                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285687/#Comment_285687" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T05:24:15+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  5:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Monte Johnson</cite>I do think the message I intended is reasonably placed in a discussion category on SG entitled "Game Design Help". After all, what I am seeking is game design help. Wouldn't it make sense to move the discussion to Praxis once the game has been played (i.e.play-tested) and there is some "practice" of the game to discuss? I am probably in error since I have never posted to this forum, but at present my game is at the extreme theory end of the theoria-praxis spectrum. It is not even possible to revise the rules, because they have not yet been codified for the first play-testing session.</blockquote>\nHi: This category "Game Design" will be retired soon. All discussion of game design, theory, "getting started" etc will soon happen over on Praxis.Then, once a playtest or final version is available, you'd post here with the download/feedback information.<br/><br/>Sorry if that's confusing. When the site started, there were occasional design/creation threads here and there, with no issues. But in the past year they've increased dramatically, and have taken away from the focus of the site. Hence the creation of the Praxis site.<br/><br/>No problem here: Go ahead and finish this thread out normally. Just wanted to prepare you for "the future" (of about 2-6 weeks) when this category will no longer exist here.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
