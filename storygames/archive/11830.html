That's by the book. Although it seems odd that the player, by Giving, gets what they were hoping to accomplish.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm not the first person to have thought of this, but why doesn't the following work:<br/><br/>You take on the role of your character, trying to learn to change their ways, and the GM takes the side of the forces keeping you from changing your ways.<br/><br/>What goes wrong when you do this?<br/><br/>Vincent wrote on the Forge about how doing a growth accomplishment "straight up" can lead to awkward Raises (basically, narrating for the wrong side of the equation), but why is that necessary in the formulation I've got, up above?<br/><br/>Just trying to understand a little better.

This is entirely hypothetical:<br/><br/>1. From the book: "I hope my character learned to stop swearing."<br/><br/>What can cause a person to swear? Peer pressure: a group of other young Dogs-to-be are engaging in some kind of friendship ritual together, and they're pushing the character to "let it out" with them or be ostracized from the group. Bad circumstances, pain: Maybe one of them laughs at the character's reticence to swear and stomps on his foot as a Raise.<br/><br/>2. Another one of Vincent's examples: "I hope I learned to read."<br/><br/>Here, the GM's Raises would be stuff that makes it difficult to learn to read: maybe describing how poorly hand-written a book is, or how it's getting dark and the only candle in the room is about to go out, or maybe someone is actually sabotaging the character's progress (e.g. switched the book they're reading for another book), or even a flashback where the character's uncle is shouting at them: "You're too stupid to learn readin', son! Your father never learned to read, nor his father, nor his father before him!" <br/><br/>For a Mountain Person Dog, there could be all sorts of pressure of that sort, even visions of totem spirits from the character's childhood or admonitions that reading is something that "corrupts the White Man's soul."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264234/#Comment_264234" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-27T13:11:04+00:00" title="March 27, 2010  1:11PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2010 10:25AM by Wolfe.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that's totally feasible, even if it is outside of the direct guidelines of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe Vincent's base assumption is that people tend to like who they are, and/or are comfortable as they are. Changing something about yourself is difficult, hence people tend to resist changing themselves. So the player advocates that basic nature, where the GM advocates the reasons to change. I personally think the example in the book about the character stopping swearing is ass, but the principle is sound. If you disagree with the basic assumption, I don't think you're going to break the game by bending that small thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually did a growth accomplishment with my first Dogs character. He was amazing with guns and talking, but he'd never really found the middle ground. So that was my accomplishment: "I hope Dove discovers the middle ground." A few brief exchanges... and the GM Gave! I was like... "Wha-?" then "That was awesome!" It fit so well. It was risky, because he essentially threw my hope out the window, but it made for a more interesting tension in the character, and the fiction just... fit. So he ended up with the trait "There is no middle ground."<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is this: Have you tried it as written, and didn't like it? Or does it just seem backward to you? If the latter, I'd recommend you give it a try as written. It ends up working better, from my experience, than you might expect. If the former, then I say go for it, and try it your way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264266/#Comment_264266" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T09:15:57+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  9:15AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done it both ways, and rarely had more problems doing it one way than the other. <br><br>Really, the issue is to make sure that the challenge is going to sit in a place where both sides can think of good raises that feel like they're effective, driving, and punchy.

Triats, items, and escalation are likely enough to swamp even the 4d10 in many circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is true, I think that characters picking an accomplishment are more likely to have successful outcomes and characters trying to grow out of a habit are more likely to fail (since there would be a general bias in favor of the PCs side and they are playing against growth).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying this doesn't make a lot of sense, lasting change IS harder to attain than a singular accomplishment.  I'm just wondering if experience players have observed that 4d6+4d10 favors the Player's die pool over the GMs. (Again, not a complaint, just trying to get a better feel for the game).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279198/#Comment_279198" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T09:14:32+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  9:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2010 9:16AM by noclue.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup. 4d6+4d10.
