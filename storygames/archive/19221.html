Beyond just stating "a game designed to emulate X game from the last century," what is the difference experientially?<br/><br/>For those of you that enjoy them, what draws you to OSR style gaming? What draws you to them? What need to they satisfy that you would choose that game over other, more modern games?<br/><br/>For context: <br/><br/>The first game I ever played was a reverse-engineered homebrew of AD&amp;D. We started with a DMG and a Monster Manual we picked up at a yard sale and basically built the game backwards from what we could glean in the charts and examples given there. Oddly, we were almost dead on. <br/><br/>I've played a lot of games since then, but after a few beers I got to discussing those old, first games again. I got a bit of nostalgia and dug out my old books. After a bit of reading, I realized that I had no interest in actually playing oldschool D&amp;D again, but I'm very interested in trying to distill the <i>feel</i> of those old experiences into something I can build future designs around emulating.  To this end, I understand that my experiences may not be other people's experiences, so in order to make this a more well-rounded experiment I want to understand how other people experienced it. <br/><br/>Thanks in advance, I look forward to the discussion.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428337/#Comment_428337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T21:53:54+00:00" title="February 16, 2014  9:53PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2014 9:57PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What makes it feel old-school to me?

And also no one needing to be anywhere to do anything tomorrow morning.<br/><br/>Some of that can probably be recaptured (and the sarcastic in-jokes never really went away), except for the "no one needs to do anything tomorrow" part, so...yeah, it ain't gonna happen.

Just roll up a new one and join up again, dude.

There's still a real commitment to Zero-to-Hero over a long play arc/campaign. Luckily, dungeon bashing for advancement really is a known quantity. <br/><br/>Non D&amp;D Fantasy OSR ish games still seem to suffer a bit from the problems that non-D&amp;D Fantasy early RPGs suffered from: it wasn't quite clear exactly what your characters were meant to be doing, and going from Zero to Hero doesn't necessarily make a whole lot of sense given the source material they're inspired by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428342/#Comment_428342" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T06:50:55+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  6:50AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2014 2:40PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About the game and mechanics I can tell you this: there's a before and after skill lists. I'm from the generation who learned to play with skill lists, and it seems like before a lot of that stuff was either resolved through GMfiat, a long argument (involving logic, "common sense", physics, thermodinamycs and quick calculations on both subjects) and other more or less practical solutions.<br/><br/>Veteran OSR players still play this way despite the existence of skills, while players from my generation (who have not played with veteran nor learn their techniques elsewhere) mostly rely on skill rolls, use less scientific arguments, roleplay just enough to add a narrative/color contribution to the scene and might be less cautious in general when dealing with the fiction, often throwing their characters in trouble just to see what happens next.<br/><br/>The line between both play styles is quite blurred because old school techniques have actually passed down from player to player and GM to GM. So, while the first games I tried relied on skill lists (where all you had to do to solve a situation was to look up on your character sheet for anything that you could roll for on the present situation, and/or come with an excuse for rolling it), I learned to try caution whenever was possible and how important was to keep the fiction logical. Like, not allowing the GM to get away with, say, putting a gas stove on a spaceship and have an NPC cut the gas feeding tube, ignite it with his swords and TPK our party with this improvised flamethrower (actually happened and we bickered the GM to death after that).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428343/#Comment_428343" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T07:58:30+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  7:58AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might glean some goodness from this fairly elaborate thread:<br/><a href="Talk to me about OSR" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18975/talk-to-me-about-osr/p1</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_428351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428351/#Comment_428351" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T14:20:48+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  2:20PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            10 year old boys, with their concomitant opinions.<br/><br/>"Nostalgia isn't what it used to be." - Simone Signoret                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen" title="Vanveen"><img alt="Vanveen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen">Vanveen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428377/#Comment_428377" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T09:28:38+00:00" title="February 18, 2014  9:28AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started with the Blue Box in 1979 at a tender age. I've been doing a lot more boardgaming in the past decade or so, but am beginning to explore the idea of OSR again. <br/><br/>Here's the basic difference. <b>OSR is not a commercial product</b>. 3.5 and 4.0 <b>are</b>, and Next presumably will be too. Now before the flame jets start, what do I mean by that?<br/><br/>Quite simply, OS/R (the original and clones, for convenience) is not structured in a way that makes it easy to consume. It is typically very difficult for beginning OS GMs to judge encounter difficulty, encounter length, play session length, or even play session SUCCESS until a) they get some experience and b) they know a particular group well. New school products have solved these issues very well (and whether you <i>like</i> that solution is up to you...that's not something this post will address). In short, the new school has made it possible to have four-hour play blocks at your local game shop. These games will generally be fairly enjoyable, especially to new players, since expectations are generally clear, feedback is clear and immediate (the players typically have a feeling of "getting somewhere") and the experience usually provides a strong sense of closure toward the end of Hour 4.  The mechanics tend to minimize group friction and group quirks--to put it another way, you can usually run them with a group of complete strangers and things will go fairly well. As icing on the cake, players are given a lot more specific options and powers, have fewer apparent restrictions on their character choices (half-dragon? no problem!!!) and generally stay alive quite a bit longer. Logistics, healing times, and other "mundane" things seem to be much more important in OS than in new school. <br/><br/>OS/R games often involve the Wall of No. That is, players are typically forced to make hard choices and give things up. They may not be allowed to play certain races or even classes in a particular game. Attempting to play things like a half-dragon will evoke rich laughter from traditional OS GMs. Players will never be able to progress as high with an elvish magic-user as with a human one, because elves have so many inherent advantages. They are largely limited to the outlook of their class and even their alignment. Characters that end up super powerful will be very very weak for a very long time. Fatalities and serious injuries, the kinds with real game effects (draining weeks of time if nothing else) are quite common. In general, players HATE this...until eventually some don't. But NONE of this is particularly conducive to a successful commercial product, especially one that relies on getting new players (the whole player base turns over every five years or so, give or take).<br/><br/>So OS/R is a lot looser, with a lot more potential for awesomeness and for total failure. OS/R can be a total cluster when you run it at a tournament, or are trying to finish room <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> of a 30-room dungeon before 2 AM, or when you need to prep something fast and are looking for some guidance in the rules (heh).  But when done well, with a group that works well together, it's a literally transcendent artistic experience. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428449/#Comment_428449" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T06:57:08+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  6:57AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>10 year old boys, with their concomitant opinions.</blockquote>\nOh, please: that's just stupid bigotry.

I run 1-2 OSR games a week (at home). I also run Warhammer FRPG, and now a little bit of Runequest and CoC 1-offs. We also do an occasional 4e or Apocalypse World deathmatch game. I went from playing and running B/X and 2e during my pre-teens and teens, to missing all of 3e D&amp;D, coming back for 4e D&amp;D, getting burnt out on that and eventually transitioning to the OD&amp;D/B/X hybrid I now run.<br/><br/>So that's where I come from.<br/><br/>I have no idea about what most of the people on this thread are talking.<br/><br/>The OSR D&amp;D I run is mostly rules-light, fiction forward, almost "troupe style" with the high frequency of character disabling that goes on. It's pretty strongly oriented toward the characters and their stories, but the stories are frequently ruptured as they get knocked out, mutated, run for the hills, etc. <a href="http://gameswithothers.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">The stuff on my blog</a> is a bit game-y compared to a lot of the stuff in which I play, but that's because the stuff on my blog is what I've made/am making for the home group and we like things a bit more game-y.<br/><br/>The OSR D&amp;D in which I play is very rules light (there are basically 5 rolls: attack, damage, saves, ability score checks, thief-like ability checks). In the OSR game I played last night there was a German Thief, an Elf Assassin, two Bastards (hacked bard class), a Battle Princess, a Murder Princess, two Fighters and a Magic-User. My character's alignment is officially, "Chaotic Bad." In another recent game characters included a Droid, Bear-man and Combat Journalist. There have also been Magitech Engineers, poison-blooded cleric/wizards, mole-men, goblin, child, undead child, etc player characters.<br/><br/>I posted this on G+ in respect to last night's game:<br/><br/>"last in the digiplane:<br/><br/>varieties of monstergirls<br/><br/>lightning bolts approach, then are no more, as if they never happened, just the smell and a momentary flash, to the amazement of their casters<br/><br/>there are nets and there is leaping and wall surgery and a lot of lightning bolts and webs and stabbing<br/><br/>I drop a bomb on a prone wasp man's head and chuckle behind my surgical mask as its face suddenly unravels across the floor and becomes colors, unrecognizable<br/><br/>control maggots, writhing from a wall, curling, then burning and popping<br/><br/>trapped schoolgirl from another dimension appropriately arrayed in uniform<br/><br/>Manning ominously absorbs goo, watches it slowly seep into his hand, a look of loss/vacant sadness on his face, but the goo has no apparent effect<br/><br/>a pop, the smell of ozone and the sound of two people hitting the ground in the room next door.

I almost think it represents a product classification rather than a genre - trying to identify "what do canned foods taste like" from a can of El Pato hot sauce and a can of Veg-All mixed vegetables.

Just click around drivethrurpg sometime. There's a fucking avalanche of commercial aspirations in the OSR, it's probably the most vibrant/active classification going in indie commercial RPG publishing right now.

Uncle Gary was crazy for it until he wasn't any more (AD&amp;D, maybe? probably about when it became a big business?). Some of that (especially the mish-mash of classes) has to do with the way G+ OSR games work - each GM's setting is pretty tight, consistent, but the PCs wind up from being all these different settings. But there is at least some textural similarity there to really early D&amp;D, with its vampire, demon (balrog?) and dragon PCs, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428466/#Comment_428466" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T09:12:10+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  9:12AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2014 9:13AM by Potemkin.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, saying the OSR is not commercial is just wrong.

OSR products are rivalled by "Indie RPG Products" in sheer numbers. So, sure, OSRs commercial, but in the same way that all fish are wet - it's the environment they live in. The claim that OSR is somehow above the market (why this is important, I have no idea) is owed in part to the whole pubic-access grandfather clause thing with the written material itself. <br/><br/>We're off course here, cap'in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428470/#Comment_428470" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T09:40:14+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  9:40AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the whole pubic-access grandfather clause thing</blockquote>\n+1.<br/><br/>To the OP:<br/><br/>1. Nostalgia. It's not the only reason to play old school, but it's one.<br/>2. Challenge. Unlike most narrativist games, OS games really can facilitate a "step on up" style of play, if you cooperate with them. Strategy and tactics are important, and player skill is rewarded. This does have to do with the absence of skill lists, as Warrior Monk pointed out. Players who grew up before the advent of skill lists are always trying to come up with clever gimmicks to overcome opposition (through fictional positioning), rather than simply rolling the appropriate skill.<br/>3. Suspense. TallPaul is dead on about this one. In my Red Box game, players were constantly on the edge of their seats because PCs could die at any moment. You really have to experience this to understand it.<br/>4. Easy to hack. You can easily create new races, classes, spells, items, and subsystems without breaking the game. This allows for the kind of zaniness that PW_Shea describes (but really, WTF man, that sounds more like a William S.

I encourage anybody to read up on the discipline of cultural history if you're confused about what kind of thing a "current of cultural history" is <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>This means that I am objectively speaking in the same camp with Jason on this: you can't point at specific rules, degree of commercialization, or any such easy analytical yardsticks when "defining OSR". The OSR people themselves have come to this conclusion by now, I understand! They used to have these big discussions about who's OSR and who's not, and they were mostly bullshit when people tried to define it by "has to use retro-clone rules" or "has to be playable with old D&amp;D" or "has to pertain to stuff published pre-80s". The only feasible and realistic way to define a cultural trend like that is to look at cultural influences: OSR is the things that take influence from other OSR things, to whatever extent that they do. The first OSR things, in turn, were mid-00s bloggings, discussions and products that harkened back to old school D&amp;D - this is again not an analytical definition in that not everybody who happened to harken back to D&amp;D in mid-00s gets to be OSR; only those initiatives from which the thing actually later named OSR are counted when defining the roots of the cultural trend.<br/><br/>By this measure I can easily say that my current D&amp;D campaign is both "Forgite" and "OSR" at the same time: it takes ample influence from both, in ways that could be fully documented if I cared to. Neither of those concepts are rationally speaking some discrete boxes where you put things.<br/><br/>However, in the spirit of the actual question, perhaps I should say what I find interesting or relevant in the OSR: there are many things in it, but the part that I <i>feel</i> is interesting and relevant to me is the challenge-based, goal-oriented, fiction-based conflict resolution using, rulings-structured old style D&amp;D. So I guess that if I had to go purely by feel instead of cultural history heuristics in determining whether something is or isn't OSR, that gauge would be whether it's usable in my D&amp;D campaign. If it's irrelevant to my D&amp;D due to whatever, then I'm probably not feeling it. Old school Traveller <i>can</i> still be OSR according to that cultural history heuristic, but it's not relevant to me in the same way a OSR D&amp;D adventure module is.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428473/#Comment_428473" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T10:31:30+00:00" title="February 20, 2014 10:31AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To the OP:<br/><br/>4.

You can create new races, classes, spells, items, and subsystems for classic, Red Book Chivalry &amp; Sorcery without breaking the game: the publishers themselves did this (with Saurians, Nordics, Land of the Rising Sun, and etc), but I wouldn't exactly call such hacking easy.<br/><br/>As to whether Red Book C&amp;S is "old-school", I think that's a bit of an open debate that's been kicked around, along with other similar era games (Classic Traveller, Runequest 1e and 2e, TFT, Tunnels &amp; Trolls, and etc). There's certainly a contingent that think that "old-school" means "pre-2e (A)D&amp;D" and that's about it; I'm not necessarily one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428474/#Comment_428474" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T10:39:15+00:00" title="February 20, 2014 10:39AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all!

But as a veteran of that day, I can certainly speak to how a lot of rules were ignored, or bent, or used completely contrary to intent--at least at a lot of the tables I played at, because we were trying to make a story experience happen and used the rules we had to hand.<br/><br/>This is as it should be--it's a <i>renaissance</i>, after all, and in the historical era called the Renaissance most people didn't put on togas and start only speaking Classical Latin. (At least not in public.) I think it also explains why OSR people and Story Gamers tend to grok each other, or even overlap.<br/><br/>Some of what Eero talks about--especially the challenge-based play, <i>especially</i> the "player challenge" aspect--certainly was a common feature of the early playstyle; but it's also an emergent feature of the rulesets themselves, as many have discovered.<br/><br/>FWIW, Eero, I think playing Black Book Traveller could get pretty OSR, although it's a different variety of the same. (The combat system was ridicudeadly.) Certainly the minigames--the trade &amp; speculation in particular--and the default sandbox playstyle make it a lot more OSR than not.<br/><br/>So...what would make a game OSR to me would be, emergent playstyle from fidelity to the rules, coupled with a...lack of an opinion from the rules as to what that playstyle would be, if that makes any sense. (Plus a more challenge-based, player focused gameplay.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen" title="Vanveen"><img alt="Vanveen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen">Vanveen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428480/#Comment_428480" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T11:34:27+00:00" title="February 20, 2014 11:34AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My original point about OSR not being commercial seems to have been missed--yes, of *course* OSR rules are being sold all over, and everyone's got one for sale (although the actual sales figures are a tiny fraction of what you think when you glance at drivethru or a similar source). By non-commercial, I mean that OSR is not structured for consumption, which is really the key to the whole matter. It's got a much higher introductory learning curve, generally requires a lot more prep work until you know what you're doing, and is subject to breakdowns in many many places until you Get It. <br/><br/>Most of us tended not to notice this at the age of twelve. Then we Got It after some years of play or obsessive study or both. And so now, coming back to OSRIC or another clone (and as much wiser adults), we tend to forget what that initial climb was like. RPGs in general are of course baked into our overall culture, as everyone pointed out when Gygax's obituary was written, and that makes it easier too.<br/><br/>4e is structured like a commercial product: it is easier to consume, in terms of learning it, playing it, and successfully playing it (i.e., liking it enough to repeat the experience) for new players. WOTC did this with Magic, too, of course. Those of us who were around for that game's very beginnings will recall the incredible mess it was...it went far beyond the Power Nine, involving hundreds of wording and timing issues, no agreement on deck size or format, and even philosophical debates about the possibility of fixing the system. This wasn't going to work; you needed a format that you could support at stores, turnkey no problem, from Albuquerque to Zanesville. That way you'd make your product a steady seller and immune to that deadly geekproduct plague, the Sudden Loss of Interest.  So they did that. Then they did it for Dungeons and Dragons. I despise the result...but they didn't do it for me. <br/><br/>Think of it as home cooking vs. Applebee's. As any of you who grew up in an Irish-Norwegian household like mine probably know, "home cooking" is not necessarily a guarantee of quality. It might rock your socks or leave you hugging the toilet.  Applebee's is not going to win any kind of Great Experience awards, and serious chefs often despise it (rightly so). But you also know exactly what you're going to get, every time, and it may not be the best meal you've ever had, but it will be far from the worst.

It's up there with some of the most contemporary of games in terms of graphic design while still riffing on the OSR aesthetic. I think this aesthetic (v. 70s, B&amp;W inkwork, columns, tables) is probably essential (or at least indispensable, for better or worse) to the OSR as a genre. <br/><br/>I'm a huge believer in the physical props of play (dice, maps, character sheets, rule books) having a great influence on play, especially in D&amp;D. Once you start dropping these components (or letting them recede into the verbal) then you start to loose the OSR thread. What we are <i>doing</i> at the table is just as important as what we're saying - no one is a brain in a jar.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen" title="Vanveen"><img alt="Vanveen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen">Vanveen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428562/#Comment_428562" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T12:26:06+00:00" title="February 21, 2014 12:26PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think there's a belief among OSR enthusiasts that they are an approach an RPG should take if it wants to be commercially successful.

From a business standpoint, 0e and 1e (and Basic, and Expert) were a red-hot mess, and in fact TSR and its founders proceeded to make nearly every classic mistake in the book, the mistakes you learn not to make during your first year of the MBA. That is not going to happen again, ever, with Dungeons and Dragons.<br/><br/>The crop of indie producers, most of whom have as little (possibly less) business experience than the founders of TSR, will generally be able to steer clear of these issues simply because they'll never get big enough. They'll never get big enough because they are very late followers.   Again, TSR is a classic case of the first mover. If you introduce a product literally unlike any out there (Magic the Gathering, 0e, the Visicalc spreadsheet program) it may break very big very fast. At this point, chances are some suits are going to show up...for your own sake, sell before you implode your company or they figure out a way to kick you out.<br/><br/>But in a world of RPGs, CCGs, and Excel, you're not going to be able to get that first mover advantage again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428569/#Comment_428569" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T13:33:53+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  1:33PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For feel of an OSR game, I think that part of it is that you just don't need to know much of the rules in order to play.

A sense of DIY is really important here, so a design that visibly uses amateur tools is achieving something in terms of the politics of the game as well as educating readers about how to play it in a nonverbal way (the same thing I have to explain when my players ask where to write things on their character sheet and I reply that I don't care because it's <em>their</em> character sheet)<br/><br/>2. Maybe connected with the business conversation going on here there is something very powerful about the mysteriousness of a lot of early texts. Just as the dice are real ritual objects with a big sense of magic about them, Old School D&amp;D books in some way feel like real books of spells. And there's a language here that is very different from the kind of magic that the full-colour wotc books aim for. Simple black and white books with dense mysterious text have a real honesty about their natures that mass-produced colour can't, especially with fake yellowed pages or whatever that are actually still glossy.<br/><br/>The AD&amp;D1 books are incredible in their mysterious density. AD&amp;D2 in first printing, despite being much more readable, did something functional with their blue headings. Of course there's a whole vernacular of dungeon modules with blue maps, and the white box. And those amateur B&amp;W illustrations that you used to see are an incredible perfect place between early printed engravings or real medieval illumination, comics, and things drawn by people with zero training on their character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428588/#Comment_428588" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T18:36:27+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  6:36PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, this may seem like a silly question, but I'm actually asking in all honesty:<br/><br/>Is <a href="http://www.headinjurytheater.com/article73.htm" rel="nofollow">this kind of thing</a> a big part of the OSR appeal for any of you?<br/><br/>I've definitely seen some people reference this kind of thing in the OSRsphere, with loving care.

Sort of like that owlbear kick that the story games scene got onto a couple years back, dramatize that shit instead of just laughing at how lame it is. The owlbear is no more dangerous than a bear, but it can be more eldritch, easily. (Important to keep an open mind and not read that monster description like a bible - who's to say that the sad yet wise eyes of the owlbear <i>don't</i> see into your darkest sins, truly?)<br/><br/>I'd be terrified by a monkeybee if I encountered a nest in the wilds, myself. It only gets lame when you make D&amp;D all business-like, like the player character adventurers deal with weird crossbreeds all day five days a week like they were visiting Final Fantasy grinding woods. Keep them in the dungeon, keep them rooted in the magic and corruption and cosmological purposes inimical to human civilization, and you really don't need your monsters to be any stranger than a random crossbreed. (To clarify: I agree 100% that these critters are lame when you build an entire ecology around them, like people on a fucking farm breed them or something, and then your adventurers get to rustle them when they escape.)<br/><br/>I actually wrote an adventure last year that was all about D&amp;D crossbreeds, <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByZPO7dbW0godHNzRWtiVUhYdGc/edit?usp=drive_web" rel="nofollow">Miscegenation of the Ancients</a>. Didn't fare well in the One Page Dungeon contest, so maybe others are skeptical of crossbreed monsters, too <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>As for your question, though, I wouldn't say that the stupid monsters are directly a part of the appeal for me. I mean, I've come to appreciate that perhaps D&amp;D fantasy is not as lame as I've traditionally thought, when you approach it judiciously, but it's still something I could take or leave. I've used a lot of dungeonesque material when GMing because I've been running modules, but when I create my own stuff it usually veers in its own directions soon enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen" title="Vanveen"><img alt="Vanveen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen">Vanveen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428647/#Comment_428647" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T20:59:51+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  8:59PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, many of those monsters (rust monster, owlbear, bulette, a couple others) were in fact modeled after some weird Japanese plastic figures Gygax, this writer, and apparently a bunch of other people owned in the 1970s.

That's much more succinct than my average attempts at lucidity <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>And it is the case that D&amp;D fantasy carries literarily <i>much</i> better once you treat it as its own, discrete set of literary inspiration that you have to embrace consciously. It only becomes a poisonous bole in the face of your attempts at stylish fantasy roleplaying when it is some sort of a baseline upon which everything has to be built, as if all the dungeonerie were inherent to all fantasy. TSR used to have a long this problem in spades: a TSR gothic horror setting is about orcs with fangs, a TSR Near East fantasy is about orcs with turbans, and so on. You never get a TSR setting built from the ground up, it's always just a superficial recoloring of Greyhawk. I'd say that I've learned to be much more positive about the Gygaxian fantasy once I've had opportunity to really take it or leave it, instead of having to accept it as integral part of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428681/#Comment_428681" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T02:11:37+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  2:11AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sidenote. <br/>I reckon someone (me) should write up some tables for OSR dungeon generation that gives a "mythos" or "lore" for that game.

The universal scorn with which the Fiend Folio was greeted may be a result of this...those creatures were overwhelmingly invented by amateurs, not based on existing myths and archetypes.

If I am running a place that doesn't have a good chart, the game will suffer. I use the chart to help fill in pre-written encounters, not the other way around.

OD&amp;D, in particular, lends itself to a certain type of dungeon that is often called a "megadungeon" and that I usually refer to as "the underworld." There is a school of thought on dungeons that says they should have been built with a distinct purpose, should "make sense" as far as the inhabitants and their ecology, and shouldn't necessarily be the centerpiece of the game (after all, the Mines of Moria were just a place to get through). None of that need be true for a megadungeon underworld. There might be a reason the dungeon exists, but there might not; it might simply be. It certainly can, and perhaps should, be the centerpiece of the game. As for ecology, a megadungeon should have a certain amount of verisimilitude and internal consistency, but it is an underworld: a place where the normal laws of reality may not apply, and may be bent, warped, or broken. Not merely an underground site or a lair, not sane, the underworld gnaws on the physical world like some chaotic cancer. It is inimical to men; the dungeon, itself, opposes and obstructs the adventurers brave enough to explore it. For example, consider the OD&amp;D approach to doors and to vision in the underworld\u2026</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428797/#Comment_428797" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T15:52:07+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  3:52PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for this, it was a good read.

(If you haven't read it, it's free and shouldn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes to read once through). Is it missing things? Including things that people don't think are core? Discussing things at entirely the wrong level to be useful in this discussion? (After all, the author isn't setting out to characterise OSR play - rather, it's a very practical handbook on how to get started).<br/><br/>Do read it, but here's a reminder of the author's 4 "zen moments":\n<ol>\n<li>Rulings, not Rules</li>\n<li>Player Skill, not Character Abilities</li>\n<li>Heroic, not Superhero</li>\n<li>Forget \u201cGame Balance\u201d</li>\n</ol>\nIf <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen%27s">@Eero_Tuovinen's</a> around, one question I had specifically relating to his group's play (and I know he doesn't necessarily claim to be engaging in OSR play): Your group seems to make use quite a lot of "character abilities" - you have a feat ecosystem, and your snippets of actual play seem to involve a certain amount of "roll to search this room". The primer eschews that kind of thing in favour of expecting the players to describe in detail how they search and where they look. Is that actually a difference between the primer's play and yours, or have I misunderstood? And if it is a difference, why do you choose your way, and do you see it as better (at least for some kind of play), or just an option among many, or what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428859/#Comment_428859" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T17:10:29+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  5:10PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some pretty big differences between how the Primer characterizes play and how I do it myself, yes. I don't consider those differences massively important in terms of creative agenda (that is, to me it seems that Finch plays for very similar reason to mine, when I consider the totality of his work), but rather more like matters of game design strategy, and taste in execution - it's simply about how one best accomplishes the creative goals with the tools one has on hand. My play is not mechanically orthodox old school D&amp;D, as should be pretty obvious, while Finch cleaves very close to traditional mechanics; I think he would disagree, but to me it seems like he's mechanically conservative for the sake of being conservative, rather than selecting the best ideas from among all options. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I should hasten to add: I'm very much a tinkerer, designer type personality, which is often not true of the big OSR writers; it seems like a very natural choice to stick by what you know instead of wasting time and risking ill results by being extremely open to mechanical innovation like I tend to be.<br/><br/>The reason for why I use relatively ample rolling pertains to achieving better realism in execution of problem-solving: there are certain things that are not true to life (a central concern for me: does choosing this procedure for resolution make our problem-solving more true to life, or does it take it out into some self-referential rules-mechanical la-la-land?) when they are consistently left up to player decision-making. For example searching, diplomacy, lock-picking, bravery, remembering to pack your underwear are all examples of activities that rely on character competence that cannot really be captured very well by choices a player makes in the comfort of the game table: we cannot measure character alertness by player alertness, I think, and thus would rather roll to find out how alert a given character is being at a given moment in time.<br/><br/>It should be noted that there is another very good reason for shying away from character abilities, one that I think Finch doesn't address in the Primer: trad style (or middle school, which might be clearer a term in this context) roleplaying games routinely over-emphasize character abilities in a formalistic manner in their resolution schemes (I mean the tendency to reduce every imaginable task into a question of whether you've invested skill points in that thing), which is not true of most early flavours of D&amp;D; a big, very valid reason for shying away from the entire panoply of modern skill rolls and such is that you get a <i>more</i> true-to-life resolution by abstracting away individual differences than by deriving every possible roll out of character abilities. For example, the traditional search for secret doors is 1/6 per searcher per time unit per area to be searched; this is much more realistic than e.g. the 3rd edition search skill check, which presumes that human beings have some sort of trainable searching faculty that can make such a difference as to make a task that is impossible to the layman a virtual certainty for the trained searcher. The OSR reluctancy towards universal skill systems and such may well be interpreted in this light, it's not necessarily the case that everybody underwrites that Finch model of replacing character abilities with player abilities.<br/><br/>(One mechanical watershed that I've fiddled with lately is the notion of removing the ability array entirely from D&amp;D. As some of you might know, my currently most-used house rule set for D&amp;D features extreme probability weight for abilities: practically all rolls are on the d20, and all rolls get bonuses on a 1:1 basis from ability scores, making it one of the most radically ability-emphasizing D&amp;D variants imaginable. My friend Olli Kantola, on the other hand, has been running a very ability-sparse game, sort of similar to Swords &amp; Wizardry except even more minimal, and I have to say that I've liked some aspects of that; I could well see myself trade in some of the good points of the extreme ability emphasis for the good points of dropping abilities altogether at some point in the future, just for the change of pace.)<br/><br/>In practice I should emphasize that I don't think that Finch is wrong in drawing attention to player skill - it is an important argument, even if I do not think that it is the <i>only</i> argument. Just like with so many other design considerations in D&amp;D, you have to strike your own balance between system elegance, practical utility in the moment, realism, character differentiation, opportunity for player skill, and probably a couple other "virtues" that I'm forgetting right now. For example, it is not the case that searching for traps in a trapped corridor would be strictly up to a random roll at my table; rather, the procedural principle is that players can "call it" by describing their search correctly, and succeeding in that (happens rarely, but it is possible) gives automatic success without needing to roll. Rolling for tasks that can be "called" like that is theoretically a back-up mechanism that ensures for us that characters get a fair chance whether the situation at hand is possible to resolve by player insight or not. (This isn't a trivial division to make: you can't, or at least I can't just divide all tasks on the spot into ones that are best resolved by player skill and ones best resolved by character skill. For this reason I've settled upon a combined approach that allows each task to be resolved in either way.)<br/><br/>As a practical example that has been established by so much precedent that it's basically stone-solid at this point: if a slime or giant spider or whatever lurks in the ceiling of a corridor or room, waiting to jump upon any passerby, a player may obviate all mechanical risk by explicitly stating that they are observing the ceiling as they proceed; it's automatic success in spotting the threat. However, if a player merely calls for a generally careful approach (without specifying that it's the ceiling they're concerned about), a Wits check is used to find out whether the character spots the danger, and how soon. (If the approach is "non-careful" due to e.g. being in a hurry, the roll is either more difficult, or the spot is automatically failed.) The "calling it" rule cannot be spammed abusively or set "on automatic", though, as it's relative to standard precautions: players <i>can</i> determine that their characters will "always look at the ceiling as we advance", but that will at most make the spot checks a bit easier rather than giving consistent automatic success. To properly get a free pass by calling a danger in advance, you need to specifically call it case-by-case, which is a separate consideration from ordinary procedure. (Not that ordinary procedure <i>can't</i> provide auto-successes in things like spotting ceiling threats: define your rate of progress as enormously slow, or establish that your character observes <i>only</i> the ceiling, and I will allow that your character really can't miss noticing any irregularities that are possible to notice by naked eye. Ultimately you can avoid dice rolling by sufficiently belaboring the fictional positioning to the point where failure is no longer credible.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428862/#Comment_428862" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T19:36:13+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  7:36PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Progress is enormously slow already, however.

My home game (which I was discussing above) doesn't exactly go chapter-and-verse according to some single text. I'm sure that the logical construction one ends up with would be different with different assumptions.<br/><br/>Insofar as it matters, in my game encumbrance doesn't decrease exploration speed, as it's nowhere near the bottleneck issue in determining how fast you proceed with those constraints. That's just one of those small weird things that I don't even think about when applying D&amp;D in practice; the game has a lot of mechanical peculiarity that is best ignored in favour of making your own rulings that will presumably make more sense to your particular playgroup (perhaps because yours are the more sensible, realistic and knowledgeable rulings, or maybe just because they fit your particular brand of ignorance better than that of the TSR writers - either way, the harmony is better if you're wrong according to your own preconceptions instead of those of some random dudes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428866/#Comment_428866" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T20:22:35+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  8:22PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drifting the game, by omission of rules or rulings or houserules, is very OS/R.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, playing this kind of stuff in the early 80s, we modified or ignored all kinds of stuff.

A sort of megadungeon from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/428785#Comment_428785" rel="nofollow">Philotomy's Musings</a> (thanks Adamwb), my first and longest-running dungeon was literally alive, healed itself, and was magically more powerful than most deities.  This was really all just a way for me to explain away my neurotic need for control over the play environment.  At first.  All we needed to start was (1) a one-level dungeon (it grew to 23 levels over the years), and (2) a nearby village, in that order.  Initially, neither I nor my players gave any consideration to any larger sense of world or history.  Of course, we were 14 at the time.<br/><br/>But as the "drift" started to occur (which I perceive as partly aging, and partly a growing tolerance or desire for "stronger stuff"), we didn't shy away from the "stupid monsters".  We didn't omit things.  I kept adding things on as they were published.  We went from OD&amp;D to AD&amp;D.  The dungeon got deeper, the monsters got weirder, and the world got bigger, and bigger, and bigger.  But our play got *deeper*.  We simply accepted the weird nature of things in the D&amp;D universe (why do owlbears exist?  I dunno, why do platypuses exist?)  We accepted the game's ontology and used it as a backdrop or foundation for emotionally-charged adventure dramas with lots of roleplay and human relations stuff.  It was all very psychodrama and much more "Narrativist" than my 20 color-tabbed notebooks and eidetically-memorized knowledge of the GM's Guide might lead you to assume.  The best way I can describe it is that we found a way to "grow" a Narrativist approach on top of a densely Simulationist world.  And I agree with Eero that those "stupid monsters" can indeed be very creepy if you play them straight.<br/><br/>Now I'm uncertain whether you'd call that type of play "OSR" or not.<br/><br/>To me the acronym OSR brings to mind (a) haphazardly smooshing everything together in a single unlikely place, and (b) not paying much attention to any world beyond the dungeon.  Oh, and (c) badly typeset photocopied supplements sold in ziplock bags.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429016/#Comment_429016" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T12:03:33+00:00" title="March  2, 2014 12:03PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the differences I notice is one of attitude on the part of the players when it comes to playing OSR games.<br/><br/>I started playing Basic D&amp;D in the Fad Era of its success.
