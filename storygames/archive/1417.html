                    Not role-playing, strictly, but here goes: 13 years or so back, I really loved Blood Bowl. I loved the idea. I loved all the little asides in the books, the pictures, the gags, the teams and races, imagining this absurd game of fantasy football. The Star Player (yellow) and Companion (red) are still sitting on my shelf, and the game itself is buried somewhere along with some painted miniatures. I used to be dreaming up teams, matches, whole seasons. There were a couple of problems, though:<br/>
<br/>
1) There were never enough players available for running a whole league or something, and it took loooong.<br/>
<br/>
2) There was never enough money to buy all those minis and seldom the skill and leisure to paint them.<br/>
<br/>
3) The actual game wasnâ€™t that much fun since the rules were kind of imbalanced and, well, crappy.<br/>
<br/>
For 13 long years, I didnâ€™t think a lot about Blood Bowl. I loved the game it could have been, not the game it was. And then I learned, only now, that it has become that game.<br/>
<br/>
1) At fumbbl.com, there is a huge community of players always available for a game. League, cup, friendly match, training. All included. You can create a team in a few minutes, and a match is done in an hour (two if you are a really slow n00b like myself). The computer does all the calculation for you. You even get match statistics and a REPLAY!<br/>
<br/>
2) Since you play it on the computer, you donâ€™t need painted minis. Graphic is simple, but most appropriate, with blood and all. It is still the same old turn-based board-game, though, no difference from the actual tabletop.<br/>
<br/>
3) The rules have evolved. At fumbbl.com, they play by the Living Rulebook v4, which makes BB an elegant, sophisticatedly balanced, fast, fun game! The set-ups and tactics are also more close to real American Football than they used to be.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem that remains: Itâ€™s addictive. Dangerously so. I mean, I donâ€™t have time for this! I have too many role-playing projects already that donâ€™t receive enough attention. And all those internet forums, too. And now Iâ€™ve got those Orcs that lost their first match and are crying for revenge. Those Ogres that I really want to try out. The upcoming league match with my Norse Team that sadly lost one of its Blitzers to a Dwarven troll slayer in the first match of the season. And this itch to create an Elven team. Everybody loves a decent passing game, right?<br/>
<br/>
Anybody from Story Games registered at fumbbl.com? Iâ€™m coach Verminardo, by the way. Two games played, two games lost. Damn Dwarves.                </div>

                            It's funny. My experiences with Blood Bowl are exactly the same as yours. But my conclusions are different. Basically, yeah, Blood Bowl simply isn't as interesting to play as one would want it to be. It's a boring drag. The idea is great. But the execution sucks. <br><br>What's interesting, however, is that I think that they've done about as well as one can expect. That is, the game is stuck in the basica wargame problem, which is that either you add details which bog it down, or you reduce the details to speed it up, and make it even more bland. Basically there's a curve involved here that shows a correllation between detail and time that says that the return rate of fun is very low compared to the work involved. The number of fun moments where you get to play a dirty trick or something at a critical moment are dwarfed by the number of little decisions moving the figures around the board and whatnot. <br><br>The way I see it, if the game were actually fun to play, more people would play it, and you wouldn't have the player problem. I don't have problems putting together groups of players to play Space Hulk campaigns, for instance, that take just as much time committment. I don't have a problem putting a Blood Bowl group together, either. It's easy to sell. What I have trouble doing is getting anyone to play the second match. And almost nobody plays their third. Much less their fifth or tenth if you're trying to make a season that allows for rematches. <br><br>So what I find ironic is that, from what you say, the game isn't any different online. I mean, from your description it sounds like the matches take just as long to play out as they did with minis - and why wouldn't they? It's not like the Blood Bowl rules are difficult (seeing as the Fun ratio is so low, they at least make the game quick, erring on the less detail side). It seems to me that all you're doing here is finding the people who organized all of those Blood Bowl games way back, and who have committed themselves to playing in the memory of those seasons that they organized that died on the vine. <br><br>Which is to say that I'm betting that if you do get a league together that it'll mean getting to play the fourth game of the season...maybe. I think there'll be few actual Blood Bowls played. Oh, I'm sure the site is replete with examples of it having happened. But I wonder how many that represents with respect to number started. And how many of them were really complete, and didn't have lots of forfiets in them. I simply find it hard to believe that without improved mechanics, that the game would really be any more interesting to play.<br><br>And this is a great irony, of course, since it's a computer game. Meaning they could very easily have introduced all sorts of complex detail that's involved in the calculations and output, without adding at all to the play time. I see this regularly. I've played the computerized Space Hulk game that's just the boardgame done up this way. It's just as fun, but not particularly more fun. Oh, sure, there's the animations of marines getting taken down by genestealers and such. But other than the aesthetics, the game play is the same. Meaning that I don't find it to be really in any way superior to the TT version. <br><br>Now maybe I'm missing something. Maybe if you still haven't memorized your teams stats, then rolling the D6 under the stat might take a while longer than having the computer decide the result, and play is faster for you. Or there's something added to the engine that the TT version doesn't have. But color me skeptical. <br><br>Perhaps it's because I felt so burned by Blood Bowl, adding supplements (like Star Player) and new editions and such, thinking that if we just added the right stuff, people would be so interested that they'd dedicate all sorts of time to playing it. Never happened. So what I should say is good luck with it. <br><br>In any case, if you want a passing game with Ogres, remeber to take a snotling so you can pass him along with the ball. :-)<br><br>Mike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey Dave, you can download the rulebook for free at the site. You don't need to own the game. You do need Java.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Mike, according to what you say, chess is the most boring game you can imagine. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I like the v4 rules much better than the old ones, because the game is more open and there's more you can <i>do</i>. Given that there are people with records of 600 games and more, and given that since we have started our GroFaFo league, a week or so ago, some people have made 10+ training games, sometimes 4 in a row, I'd say there must be some fun in it. It's less boring than Axis&amp;Allies, that's for sure.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a trick to making leagues work: Star Player Points.<br/>
