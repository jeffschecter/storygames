We're currently in our third scene, after 10 days of play. I find it exhilarating and frustrating; I love the game itself, and seeing what players write, but at the same time, I'm a little frustrated that some of the players do very little or nothing. (The stuff they do write is great, and often gets picked up by others). There are/can be any number of good reasons for low participation (I mean, sometimes people have real lives etc), so it's probably just the way it is...<br/><br/>...or is it? What are your experiences? Do people post stuff regularly? Do some people start slow, then ramp up?

Engage it with more care and excitement, in the live scene as well as in the Commentary side.<br/><br/>It's Storium, you have tools. Poke them every day until they meet the post expectations of the game. They will either say something and/or drop out or step up. (this is a sort of nuclear option, but you can do it)<br/><br/>Have you done any tracking of when the slower posters are making their posts? It could be a few different factors, such as:<br/>1.  they can only post during certain times of the day, so if there's nothing pointed at them when they log in to post, then that's X time lost, so they go away and come back again<br/>  + possible solution: try to have a fresh post pointed at them up before you know they're going in to check<br/>2. their posts are more "behind the eyes" of their character, playing their PC in a more conventional RPG style<br/>  + possible solution: direct dialog and specific choice posts at them, offering PC interaction on a smaller scale with the understanding that they're not going to make big sweeping moves                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432578/#Comment_432578" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T21:19:11+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  9:19PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still stumbling around with Storium, but from what you're describing and the non-Storium games I've been in, it sounds like "That's PBP for you."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432610/#Comment_432610" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T08:44:00+00:00" title="May 14, 2014  8:44AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>What would be awesome would be a system that could make logical use of these differences in post rates somehow.

X and Y work at a computer lab and can post several times a day. Z on the other hand digs ditches and has a busy social schedule and can post on Saturdays and Sundays only and has to schedule the time. You could set the game up so that Z has an important and recurring role setting scenes or doing a frame narrative style exposition that gives the game some context and texture. So if X and Y are the plucky orphans struggling for survival in the Underhive of the orbital colony Z could be the malfunctioning AI that provides the impetus for adventure...<br/><br/>Hmmm....<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerulean" title="nerulean"><img alt="nerulean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerulean">nerulean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432624/#Comment_432624" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T15:03:57+00:00" title="May 14, 2014  3:03PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not there yet, but Storium should eventually support multiple scenes running concurrently, which is pretty much how we handled people posting at different rates in the forum communities of old. <br/><br/>Decide what's most structurally important to the sort of game you're running and make a single scene for that with rules on posting frequency that respect the people who can't post often. Then have extra scenes for those who can post a lot, doing ancilliary things or character development as suits the game. It means your main plot might run a little slower, but everyone's involved and it gives it a certain weight in comparison to the extra stuff going on around the outsides.<br/><br/>Obviously not much help until that feature's implemented, though...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432631/#Comment_432631" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T16:30:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2014  4:30PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the feature that will bring me to the table:<br/><br/>Real-time play: Chat and play live with your friends when they\u2019re online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432635/#Comment_432635" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T16:43:04+00:00" title="May 14, 2014  4:43PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2014 4:46PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ^^^ Agreed.

In that sense, Storium if anything is faster paced by default, in part because it has an extremely robust system for keeping people on the site itself.<br/><br/>That said, if you find yourself reloading any sort of play-by-post game every hour \u2013 you've missed the point. And without a question, and without commenting on the quality of the system or the intent, it's very clear that the creators took as their inspiration the already extant (and even "long extant" if I want to feel very old) play-by-post community that already exists in multiple interactive media.<br/><br/>Why is the "constant refresh" approach to PbP wrong? Because even in the days back before there was a web, there was notifications. Notifications were not pioneered by mobile applications, they were pioneered long before then by people who eventually went on to create "you've got mail!" Email was the original notification, and it was the first readily available medium by which PbP could exist. When a story or game updated, you were then notified and either took your turn or waited until the next person made theirs, committed it, and then you were notified. The next great movement of play-by-post gaming was to some of the earliest "online journal" sites (LiveJournal in particular), in particular subcommunities within the number of people that you followed. Like today, the usage pattern for a social network is that you monitor/follow/friend/Circle/whatever-the-verb-of-the-week is, and then simply use the site as you would normally, keeping an eye out for notifications, which would then tell you what the activity in your community was and then you could react appropriately.<br/><br/>Remember, this is still the PbP workflow that a far greater number of people are engaging in, right now, than the sum total of people who are actively engaged in what we think of as traditional role-playing games and their structure. Without question. They interact, they do other things on the site or in their life until a notification that their input is necessary comes up, then they reenter the flow to interact as required.<br/><br/>Storium takes that as understood to be the standard means of interaction with a game. While the side chat is wonderful and can take the place of IRC or other high-speed/immediate assumptive communicative channels, that doesn't fit with the workflow that they've created and that they've inherited. The asynchrony is a feature, a huge feature, of what they're trying to do or, at least, of what they're trying to emulate.<br/><br/>PbP exists largely so that people with other demands on their time (old-school: literal school, new school: getting the kids off to school) can go about their business until the call goes out, and then it's their turn to immerse themselves back into the story, help build an extended portion of it which should interest everybody involved, and then once again shift to waiting for notification.<br/><br/>If you know anything about different methods of message passing and the coordination of multiple live objects in modern distributed computing platforms, play-by-post is almost wholly event driven. The locks on process between actions are long-term (comparatively), so like a watched pot, checking it repeatedly will make sure that it won't boil. You're waiting for the event, the pot to boil, so instead you wait for the whistle. Now you're signaled, you act, you do what you do without worrying about the time pressure because no one is waiting for you to put down the pen \u2013 they're waiting for you to bring things to a boil so that you can now signal the whistle to trigger the next person.<br/><br/>If you're pointlessly refreshing the page every hour for three days, yes \u2013 it's a total waste of your time. If you're going about the rest of your social network engagement, across multiple platforms, and you notice a bleep, a boop, or other such notification come in, you service it. And then you go back to doing what you do.<br/><br/>That's the intent. That's the workflow. If that is not getting communicated to players in GM's on the sites \u2013 that's a whole different point of failure that I can't address.<br/><br/>And if Storium is not emailing anticipations when conditions are such in their particular story that it's their turn to inject content, they're failing to do the second most important job of the entire system, right after actually recording what people say.<br/><br/>It's not like running a game on IRC. It's like nothing so immediate. That is the part that will stick in the craw of a certain portion of the online community, but luckily we have a multitude of other methods to feed their hunger for life role-playing that does not require multi-day pauses in order to get minimal invested responses.<br/><br/>It's a good thing we have tons of diversity in online rpgs, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432658/#Comment_432658" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T00:37:48+00:00" title="May 15, 2014 12:37AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SquidLord, that post is superb.

I think that Storium as a business concern aspect a particularly bad set of horses to put before it's cart, and that the idea of going to monthly/yearly subscriptions in the face of several markets which have tried them and are madly fleeing in the other direction \u2013 any other direction \u2013 to something that is more profitable \u2013 anything that is more profitable \u2013 should have probably been taken on board long before now. I'm uncomfortable with putting the architecture of my games in the hands of someone else who provides a service which is largely unproven, the stability thereof questionable, and the ability to play with those bits limited to those who have already staked an investment, and thus are invested in convincing others that there is a there there.<br/><br/>And that's even before I wonder whether or not the GM-centric/Narrator is really the right architecture for playing what are generally highly asynchronous, power distributed, narrative games. (Hint: I don't think so.)<br/><br/>I also wonder whether or not making the means/verbs by which the players can interact with the flow of story to be limited to a very small set of cards and thus types and forms of interaction might be somewhat too constricting.<br/><br/>The ultimate thing I wonder is whether or not Storium will actually be around as an entity upon which one can play games in two years time. Or whether it will have disappeared with some amount of money, and taking not only its servers but all of the games, all of the experiences, and all the play that I might have shared with others on the platform with the expectation that it would be a much longer lived thing.<br/><br/>But as regards their grasp on the means of workflow with which Storium should fit in your everyday online life, there's really not much question at all, and the answer is extremely traditional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432661/#Comment_432661" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T01:07:34+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  1:07AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2014 2:45AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get that, Alex.  I do.  For a certain type of person.  So the following is all about what sticks in <i>my</i> craw...<br/><br/>Me, when I look at that dynamic "in action" (such as it is) I'm left feeling very high and dry.  Disconnected, suspended, alone.  I want direct P2P interaction.  I want realtime.  I want immersion.  I want some depth.  I want to roleplay, not cardplay.  I want to play a character, not myself.  I can't spend 24 hours a day in character, and I can't just jump into an immersed state like a Pavlovian dog whenever I get a ping.  Yet if I don't, I'm being rude to someone else who wants <i>her</i> immersion, and she wants it <i>right now</i> too, but then woops, we both have to wait for some other guy.<br/><br/>We both want it!  And most of the time, neither of us will get it!  This is why I said online systems will always best serve synchronous players (or at least players whose post rates and online times are roughly identical).  I didn't say they <i>won't</i> or <i>can't</i> serve other kinds of players, I simply said that to my mind (or my craw, as the case may be), they will always serve synchronous players <i>best</i>.<br/><br/>(I also know I'm not alone in this.  And this isn't specific to Storium.  It's a big craw.)<br/><br/>So when I run an RPG online (which I'm preparing to do any week now), it will start at a set time and run for a set number of hours, just like a physical gaming group.  I see no other approach as coming anywhere near replicating the level of P2P interaction and immersion I get from a f2f tabletop experience, which is what I'm looking for.  If there's a better way to do it online, I haven't found it yet.  Maybe I'll invent it. :-)<br/><br/>Well one thing is for sure: you're right about there being tons of diversity.

The fastest setting is 1 scene per day. I narrate one story and play in four, and all of them have used the default setting, but have at least initially played a lot faster. Then the narrator go missing for a few days and you're back to slightly above the stated pace. I feel that if the game says 2-3 scenes per week and players sign up for that, there should be no expectation of more frequent posting from anyone. I don't care how enthusiastic you are; you should join a 1 scene/day game if you want that speed. I think that the risk for narrator or player burnout is higher in faster paced games, at least if they're faster than expected, and that it can be good to play more leisurely from the start, even though everyone are eager to engage a new story.<br/><br/>The centralized narrator role makes it more important that the narrator is present to close the current scene and set up the next. But even if the narrator doesn't do that the players can go on playing. You can make moves without playing cards, and in two of my stories there are players who set up mini-scenes within the scene where their characters interact without playing any cards, in a say ten-move back-and-forth. The nice thing is that the stuff they create feel like it has less impact on the overall story, because they're not playing cards and winning control of challenges, so high-volume posters don't steer the story to an unproportional amount.<br/><br/>The narrator can affect how many players are needed to conclude the scene by how many cards they assign for challenges in a scene. In a 5 player game there's a maximum of 15 cards, if every player plays all their 3 cards. If the narrator only spends 9 cards, three players can conclude all the challenges even if two players don't move for a couple of days. The narrator can also end the scene with open challenges, but that's not fun for anyone, so I think it's good to limit the number of cards. On the other hand, in the above scenario three players can address all challenges before the last two players even have time to check the game, so too few cards is not good either. It's possible for the narrator to continue a scene, and you can always add more challenges if you want to give the last players something to do as well. <br/><br/>SquidLord said above that a centralized narrator may not be the best way to handle a shared story, and I agree. There's been talk about adding co-narrators to Storium, and if you can have any number of narrators it would be possible for all players to also be narrators, and to set up challenges and hand out assets and goals to each other. That sounds like a lot of fun to me, and in such a game you could easily rotate the narrator role between scenes and have characters that are in the same story, but rarely share a scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432665/#Comment_432665" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T03:17:33+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  3:17AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2014 3:18AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jonas, that's very interesting.

Is that right?</blockquote>\nThat's what I do as a narrator and what I want to see as a player. It's also good to have a big challenge, say 6 cards in a 5 player game, which means that at least three, but probably more, players have to address the challenge, while at the same time have a number of smaller 1-2 card challenges. That way the faster players can attack the big obvious challenge, while slower players still have something to do when they show up. Fix example, you can have:<br/><br/>6 cards: Fight the fire<br/>2 cards: Rescue survivors<br/>2 cards: Find out how the fire started<br/><br/>That's 10 cards out of 15 in our example, so you can have three players playing all their 3 cards and the fourth player who mops up one challenge, or all five players play 2 cards each. That's a fairly big scene, though. You can remove "Rescue survivors" and it will be a smaller and quicker scene, with the risk that three players finish all the challenges. It's not always the players want to play three cards either, so it's not good to force them to do it in every scene. It depends on how many players the narrator thinks should be required to end the scene.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed is that in one game me and the narrator are in Sweden, while the rest of the players are in the US. The narrator usually starts a new scene before she goes to bed, so I can't address it until I wake up in the morning, or actually around lunch time. By that time the Americans have usually either finished all challenges or left one of them for me to address, so I can't pick which one I like. This doesn't really bother me, and I'm sure we could fix it if I asked the others in a comment, but the dynamic is interesting.<br/><br/>One nice thing is 1 point challenges. They're basically an offer for one player to decide a specific part of the story. The narrator suggests a Strong and a Weak outcome as usual, and the player plays one card to pick which version they like (or let the narrator decide, if the player plays a neutral card). In my film noir game The Dead Don't Speak, <a href="https://storium.com/game/the-dead-dont-speak/chapter-1/scene-2" rel="nofollow">scene 2</a>, I had a number of "Get a Guy/Girl a Drink" challenges for 1 point:<br/><br/><b>Get a Guy a Drink</b><br/><i>The drinks are free, but the gesture may get people talking.</i><br/><br/><b>Strong</b>: He accepts, and during the conversation gives you a piece of information that you need. What is it?<br/><b>Weak</b>: He refuses, and leaves you standing alone. How do you react?<br/><br/>That gives the players a chance to show of what their character is like, and introduce new information into the story. I ended the scene with one of these challenges still open, because they weren't central to the story and I wanted to move on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432667/#Comment_432667" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T03:50:14+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  3:50AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">@Matthijs</a> you sounded more frustrated a few days ago.

I don't know if the options are in place yet for players to resign or narrators to kick them out (both would be needed in the full game, I think), but it would be nice to be able to ask people who posts too slow to leave the game and cycle in fresh players.

You are not the audience for every popular game. Sometimes, you are not the audience for a game that you would really, really like to enjoy. Sometimes it's the play style; it just doesn't gel with the kind of fun you want to have in your games. Sometimes it's the physical architecture that just doesn't work with how you want to play your games. Sometimes \u2013 as in this case \u2013 it's the temporal architecture that doesn't work for you in a given game (and this wouldn't even be the first one that was true of). Sometimes, it's just not for you.</i><br/><br/>And here's the hard part: <i>that's okay.</i> It's absolutely fine if the most popular thing in the room is complete crap for you. If people were honest, that would be true far more often. There are games which are extremely popular in what passes for "mainstream" RPG development that I find hideous \u2013 complete wastes of time, effort, and ink \u2013 but they have an immense following. I'll even name names: <b>Apocalypse World</b> leaves me utterly cold, even though it has all the aspects you would think would look right into my hindbrain. The GM-fullness of AW strikes me as a horrendous waste and there's just something about the way that the playbooks are constructed that I find gaming-distasteful. <b>Burning Wheel</b> \u2013 I find it a hodgepodge of mismatch mechanics, deliberately obtuse design, and a couple of really clever gemlike structures which don't make it worth putting up with the rest of the system to enjoy. Both <b>Savage Worlds</b> and <b>FATE</b> fall into that needs for me as well \u2013 I just don't like them because of certain basic failures, as I see it, in their design for the things that I want to achieve in my gaming world.<br/><br/>They are not for <i>me</i>. They are not designed for <i>me</i>. They do quite well without <i>me</i>.<br/><br/>And I'm cool with that.<br/><br/><b>Storium</b>, in particular because it has some extremely specific mechanical assumptions which go along with the very architecture of the game, maybe one of those games that I simply don't like because it just doesn't work for me, most likely in particular because it makes certain assumptions about how much and how varied and impact a given character can have in a given scene that appears to just feel wrong to me. As far as I can tell now, they've made some significant choices about centralizing power with the Narrator which I am totally not on board with. I do a serious Spock arched brow at the mechanical connection of possession of certain cards and being able to trade them for narrative/mechanical effect \u2013 not that I'm against it, but in connection with the diversity question above, I fear it might have a tendency to become a little specifically stale, the "I hit it with my sword" problem from a different direction.<br/><br/>The actual temporal pace of <b>Storium</b> might be one of those things for you that just make it not a game for you. And <i>it's cool</i> if that happens. It's all right to talk about that happening. Despite the feeling that you might get from some other inhabitants of these forums, it's okay to say that the game just doesn't work for you and that you have serious concerns about whether it actually does as well as its profligate posters would have you believe. It is even, and here comes the true heresy, okay to say, "if that's the sort of thing you want to do, this other thing might actually work better for you," and then talk about the thing that works for you instead.<br/><br/>But at some point you'll have to accept that you're a rebel and join a few of us out here in the outer dark.<br/><br/>You'll get used to it.
