From a mechanical standpoint, characters are the same -- my Madness Talent of "Mathemagician" and your talent of "Yahweh Fire a-GoGo!" are both invoked the same way, up to our ability to make our madness talents make sense narratively in a given scene.<br/><br/>Now, are you looking for that level of crunch, or do you want each player to also feel mechanically different?<br/><br/>If the latter, then you're probably looking for a game with simple-enough procedures, but with enough crunch handles that each player can have a unique "rule-breaker" power -- a way their mechanics are slightly different than everyone elses' in a way that's attached to their fictional unique ability.  In other words, mechanically reinforcing the "I am unique in the world" feel, so that it's being supported by more than solely in-fiction. (I have a crunch-level that supports this in Mythender without being too overwhelming in procedure, I think, but I don't enforce uniqueness.)<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have an answer for anything yet -- more thinking aloud. But I didn't want to wait until I had some idea to post, since the group-mind is way, way smarter than my going off to my tower.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207168/#Comment_207168" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T16:07:23+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  4:07PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing to look at is "the one" vs "the group" and "the group of ones." <br/><br/>Like, in a lot of the fantasy we're talking about there is some element of the chosen one aspect to the protagonist. This works well for games with one player, or games with one protagonist. It works less well for group games, historically that is. <br/><br/>One of the common ways around that is to do, basically, the superhero fantasy group. Justice League of Greyhawk, as it were. Doing that is possible, but it also does shift the emphasis a little. Justice League is different than Batman or Superman, even if both characters happen to be present. The shift from single protagonist does make a difference. In general, I'd speculate that the difference is between "I am a unique snowflake" and "We together, like Voltron, form a unique snowflake / blazing sword." <br/><br/>So, either you're going to need to shift the emphasis, make a game with a single protagonist (easy with a single player, more complicated - but not impossible - with a multiplayer game), or do something cooler than what I'm able to come up with at the moment. <br/><br/>Hmm, other random thoughs. <br/><br/>Fantasy Buffy the Vampire Slayer? I mean, Buffy is basically a "dark" street-level superhero right? And we've seen all sorts of ways to do Buffy as an RPG. The Slayer / The White Hats split from the Eden game, the various folks who've taken shots at it with PTA, and so forth. All of that seems like good material to steal fro... get inspiration out of. <br/><br/>I have to admit that my personal slant does head that way, anyway. Most superhero teams annoy me, for various reasons, so if I'm going to do a "unique snowflake" game, I'm going to want the majority of the uniqueness to stick to one character. <br/><br/>Anyway, any of that hitting anything for you S, or am I talking about something different than what you're after?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207174/#Comment_207174" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T16:37:52+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  4:37PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally forgot this post I made at rpg.net one time.<br/><br/>"The Middle Earth Justice League!<br/><br/>Wonder Elf - brought to life by Galadriel's magics and given the artifacts of Lothlorien, she battles injustice!<br/><br/>Numenorean Man - As a mystical continent sank forever into the oceans, two parents set their child adrift on a magical raft which brought the infant to the shores of Middle Earth, where, raised by a simple fishing family, he decided to become the world's greatest hero!<br/><br/>The Tornado - A maniacal alchemist built a golem from elemental forces in an attempt to conquer the globe, but the spirit of nature itself inhabited the Tornado and now it protects Middle Earth from those who would despoil its treasures.<br/><br/>The Orcish Manhunter - The greatest of killers among his tribe, the heroism of a simple City Guardsman in defending his home touched and purified the heart of the Orcish Manhunter.

In <em>Heart,</em> the way it works is that everyone has stats for physical and mystical ability, and different <em>growth patterns</em> for that power - the Rose starts out weak in both and grows in mystical strength as she struggles with the Shadow, the Shadow starts out strong but struggling weakens her, the Hidden discovers new abilities when she is defeated, etc.</p>\n<p>That's pretty neat because it serves as timer and story-shaping device in one.</p>\n<p>So, I dunno, something like that.</p>\n<p>Maybe like, in Nobilis terms, you've got one character who can work Creations, one who can do Destructions, one does Preservations, etc etc etc.</p>\n<p>Brand, I'm thinking more 'ensemble cast' than 'superhero team.' I don't really think this kind of literature really does the team thing that often; when it happens in <em>The Waterborn,</em> for instance, it starts out looking like a Buffy group, but the white hats get sacrificed to obstacles really quickly and soon you have two lone heroes working their way across the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li

Shreyas.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I'm looking for, uh, <em>something</em> mechanical that differentiates the characters. In <em>Heart,</em> the way it works is that everyone has stats for physical and mystical ability, and different <em>growth patterns</em> for that power - the Rose starts out weak in both and grows in mystical strength as she struggles with the Shadow, the Shadow starts out strong but struggling weakens her, the Hidden discovers new abilities when she is defeated, etc.That's pretty neat because it serves as timer and story-shaping device in one.</blockquote>\nCould you do something with Keys from The Shadow of Yesterday, where each character had specific things on which he or she could spend XP?<br/><br/>Edit: Basically, unique Keys and Advancements for each character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207400/#Comment_207400" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:04:42+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:04PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to suggest Secrets from Solar System - maybe Stunts from FATE as well. My Pentasystem has a thing called Special Effects which is based on both of those and is essentially "anything outside the basic rules that's reasonably functional". It can include mechanics. <br/><br/>If you simply said that certain Special Effects (Secrets, Stunts) belonged only to one character in the game, there you might well be.<br/><br/>Though it isn't quite as pervasive as Shreyas's example. The mechanical differences in Heart sound like they are quite large-scale and affect the whole gameplay, rather than just being a bit of a mechanical quirk that gives you bonuses or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207420/#Comment_207420" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T15:09:33+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  3:09PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I found a <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/ecb/RoseChars.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheet for Heart of the Rose</a>.<br/><br/>Mike, thanks for reminding me of the TSoY terminology.  I think this hack could definitely work if the characters had <i>unique</i> Keys and Secrets.  The Keys would shape each character's individual narrative while he or she advanced through different stages of ability.  The characters could even have unique Pool refreshes (unique Pools, too?) to further enforce how different they are.<br/><br/>The drawback I see to this is the legwork required to create the individual paths for each character.  But, heck, just throw that on the players.  "None of you can ever have the same Key or the same Secret.  Make up new stuff if you have to.  Get to it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
