Then everything the players do is emergent, and not necessarily related to any plot.<br/><br/>Out of play:<br/>The main technique I've used for over a decade is:<br/>Make 1 month pass for every week of real time.<br/>If we play an adventure or episode that takes 2 weeks, when the next one starts, 2 months have passed.<br/>If we play a 12 week episode, when that finishes, the next one starts a year later.<br/>Then devote some time to finding out what things occur in the world during that downtime, and what players have their characters do in reaction to that, or in pursuant of their own independent goals. <br/>Sometimes add in extra leaps during an adventure or episode of play, such as might occur on long journeys.<br/><br/>Also, play Pendragon. Having a campaign where every session is on average a year later than the last one does a lot to move a game to a grander, larger scale, and helps players think of things that beyond the immediate, which is I think very helpful to get away from the "do the plot all the time" mentality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331471/#Comment_331471" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T10:37:47+00:00" title="June 24, 2011 10:37AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What games do intrinsically have a plot Darren?

In the player phase, the players all take turns furthering their personal goals, which is as likely to be taking care of their families or buy their loved one a gift as it is plotting against the headmaster or building defences against invading snakes. The GM can take the output from the Player Phase and build it in as an aspect of the next GM Phase, or let the two phases progress fairly independently, as they wish.<br/><br/>WFRP3 has the concept of a "Rally Step" which takes place in between acts and within major parts of longer conflicts, which give everyone an opportunity to take a breather as well as take a single action to recover from Stress and Fatigue, do a First Aid check, etc.<br/><br/>But generally, I agree that - for good or bad - the majority of my CPU time is occupied not on slowing down the pace, but speed it up. People have a tendency to linger on little things, and little things are not usually as satisfying as addressing bigger things. This is one of the core aspects of Story Gaming which are of interest to me and the groups I usually play with; the systems tend to encourage addressing the parts of the story that matters, and minimize the time spent on parts that don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331499/#Comment_331499" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T12:44:02+00:00" title="June 24, 2011 12:44PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me the part of the story that matters is the little things.

If I have two players they race to the story, even if it's not really the point. If I have four they bicker, chew the fat, pursue personal agendas. More people makes it easy for PCs to chat among themselves since there's more possible combinations (two PCs, Bill and Ted, can only talk to each other, Rita, Sue and Bob though can have one three way conversation or three different two way ones).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331571/#Comment_331571" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T09:43:39+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  9:43AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>In my Space 1889 game the scene I loved best was a highly competent female character who in a moment of independence bought a pair of trousers, but then packed them with a sigh into her trunk because she didn't dare wear them given the shock it would cause to Victorian society.

I don't mean "stop talking amongst yourself, here's a big bad foozle to fight", but rather "we've spent enough time discussing what your character is having for breakfast, let's move on to the point where he gets fired from his job". When I say I like the facets of story games which drive this along for me, I mean games which by their setup or mechanics encourage people to address those character- or story-defining moments, rather than just hope that they will arise magically from the ether as a side-effect from play.<br/><br/>For example, in the Weapons of the Gods game we played a while back, the overarching plot was simple and straightforward (this band of Heaven Hunters must hunt down the Three Troubles and kill them to fulfill their Destiny). But the mechanics used to get there encouraged giving each other Conditions which altered our characters' personalities and relationships, use Premonitions to shape the story's future, acquire Baneful Weapons which corrupted us and "allowed" us as players to work at cross-purposes, use Destiny points in-game to acquire Lore which further shaped our characters' backgrounds and trajectories, and ample time was given to engage in these activities both in-between and during the bad-guy fights. At no point did we feel as players that we didn't know what to do next, and instigate bar brawls or seducing fair maidens because we were bored; rather, we as players held back progression of the plot because there were so many cool system and story elements to interface with, and at any given time we could call on the GM to move things ahead if things slowed down.<br/><br/>The touching and poignant moments are actually BIG story-defining moments, and it helps when the game systems recognize them as such and allow them to have a mechanical impact. In that Space 1889 game, using WotG mechanics, the player might be inspired not to wear pants because they're affected by the Propriety Inspiration, giving them a bonus to their Fire Chi related martial arts or out of a wish to affect a Fire-related Passion in someone else. In a Fate-based game, there may be an overarching, sticky, taggable Aspect called "Victorian Propriety" which the player can tag when choosing not to wear the pants, for a bonus elsewhere (or which can be invoked against them, lending mechanical weight to their decision).<br/><br/>Some play groups will find this helpful to inspire those moments and provide bi-directional tie-ins between fiction and mechanics. Others will find that approach crass and "gamey". As such it's probably not an approach that's applicable to every group, but I find it works for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331879/#Comment_331879" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T09:48:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:48AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Pixel-pitching?</blockquote>\nBitching!
