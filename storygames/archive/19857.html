It's a little experiment into fluctuating and changing characters. I wanted to create a game where characters are incredibly flexible, and can switch playstyles and focuses mid-combat.<br/><br/>E.G. the Archer could drop his bow, draw some knives, and go to town without needing to multi-class into knife-dude.<br/><br/>Also, I've written a video-game like tutorial where mechanics are slowly added in over the course of a fight until players have a better grasp of the core mechanics. I've never seen that done before, and am curious as to how well it will work<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yax_fDbPNgaIxHK4H8q3_F6Tj9Mb4qsQyG1dv1BXLmw/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Here's what I've got.</a> It's still pretty rough, and the biggest problems are the Classes, which need a LOT of work.<br/><br/>But I finally have something I'm proud to present, and am eager to refine. So critique away! Am I completely off base here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
