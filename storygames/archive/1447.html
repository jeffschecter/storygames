                    I was just re-reading <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/store/books/uc.html" rel="nofollow">Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics"</a>, which, as many of you probably know, is a comic about comics. McCloud presents the history and theories of sequential art as a piece of sequential art.<br/><br/>It got me to thinking, could one make a roleplaying game that would as brilliantly and efficiently do the same for roleplaying games? It seems all the varieties, models and styles could better be shown in play than explained.<br/><br/>I did some Googling, and I found that <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2004/10/unycon_seminar_.html" rel="nofollow">Vincent Baker had give a seminar at some con with the title "Understanding Roleplaying" that included hands-on examples</a>. This is a step in the right direction, but still short of being an actual game about games.<br/><br/>Has anyone given such a massive, interactive immersion a shot?                </div>

                            Well, there's Violence and Hackmaster. Which certainly aren't RPGs that teach the idea of gaming, but rather only work if you're familiar with the subculture and medium already.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the analogy with McCloud's work can really hold all that well, because that's Scott imparting his knowledge of a medium, whereas a published RPG book is just rules for a process. At best you could have, maybe, the "GM Training Simulator Game," but why would you do that when you could run the actual game intended to be run itself?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are crazysmart people here so I wouldn't be surprised if they <i>did</i> come up with something brilliant. But the experience of roleplaying gives good enough training in it. I think you might be saying that things could be explained a lot better, and especially written without the presumption that someone is gaming with others who've gamed before. Which is an issue.                        </div>

That's why I posted it, so bears of much more brain that me could give me some feedback.<br><br>One of things I like about McCloud's book is that it's good for beginers, fans and creators. It can be used to introduce the medium but also to make the more intermediate and expert folks think more deeply about the medium.<br><br>Personally, I would probably find this approach (done well) more palletable than reading a bunch of essays or a journal.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            To add a level of recursive zany to the discussion, some (many?) Japanese language RPGs include actual play comics in them.  I can't read Japanese but the intent is obvious and the execution is brilliant.                        </div>

                            The limited knowledge I have of Japanese RPGs includes that there seems to be a whole culture of so-called "Replay" manga - comics that retell gaming sessions. (Actual Play in manga format, how cool is that?)<br/><br/>Even if they are not Replay manga proper: "Hikaru no Go" and "Yu-Gi-Oh" feature accounts of fictional gaming sessions.<br/><br/>The difference between them and US counterexamples (Dork Tower, Knights of the Dinner Table, etc.) is that they aren't meant as parodies - the play of the game <i>is</i> the story.<br/><br/>Dirk                        </div>
