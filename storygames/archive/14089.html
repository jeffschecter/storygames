If anyone wants to correct me here, please do, but the basic ideas seem to be as follows:<br/><br/>(1) Take a well-known fictional property, such as Dune. <br/>(2) Determine a key point in the plot of that fictional property, and send it in a different direction at that key point.<br/>(3) Establish the key players at that point in the fiction, and make them as characters with their own particular goals (often opposed to one another).<br/>(4) Wind them up and let them run.<br/><br/>I want to focus on using the Smallville system in particular for this, which to me implies certain things, such as having characters who have strong relationships with each other, but who are often also antagonistic to each other. I'm not interested in using this method for a particular fiction where all the main characters would likely be on the same side. <br/><br/>I think Duneville was particularly brilliant because of that one key moment Sean honed in on, when Paul might or might not have died, but I'm curious if there are other fictional properties that can be used in a similar fashion.<br/><br/>A Game of Thrones actually seems like it might fit the bill, but (a) I'm not sure of when a good "decision point" is, to make a divergence, and (b) I'm not sure if players, in general, would have the same level of familiarity with A Game of Thrones as they would with Dune, thereby potentially complicating the efficacy of Throneville. <br/><br/>The Squadron Supreme/Supreme Power stories by J. Michael Straczynski also seemed like they could work. <br/><br/>Any other ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318966/#Comment_318966" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T19:32:56+00:00" title="April  5, 2011  7:32PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Harry Potter, because the third book's my favorite, but I found the 4th book mostly dull:<br/><br/>It's after the Quidditch Cup in book 4 ...<br/><br/>Characters:<br/>Harry <br/>Malfoy<br/>Ron<br/>Hermione<br/><br/>Ok, so Malfoy secretly has Muggle-Fever, and he's shamefully into Hermione and somehow reveals it. So Harry wants Hermione to pump Malfoy for information - what is the Dark Lord doing, what does Malfoy know?  Ron's not too crazy about that idea, though he won't admit it, and that's the final push that gets Hermione to say "Fine! I *will* seduce Malfoy." This all gets revealed after the Quidditch Cup - maybe on the Hogwarts Express into school and early in the first quarter. There's no Triwizard Tournament. Malfoy doesn't know a thing about Voldemort's plans, but he'll do anything to keep Hermione's sugar coming, so he starts making stuff up, Tailor of Panama style. Harry and Ron then get into various kinds of trouble following Malfoy's false leads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319278/#Comment_319278" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T00:00:10+00:00" title="April  7, 2011 12:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd straight up want to do this with Smallville itself, but around Season 4 or 5, at which point Clark Kent should have become Superman, and before Lex became the vessel for Zod. And, you know, actually make the Clark and Lana relationship work, since they've got real chemistry, rather than the forced destiny chemistry of Lois and Clark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
