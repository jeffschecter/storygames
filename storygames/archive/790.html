<p>Wierd little thing that requires a little context.  I love the anime series <a href="http://utd500.utdallas.edu/~hairston/nadiahpbck.html" rel="nofollow">Nadia, Secret of the Blue Water</a>.  It's good-natured fun.  The problem is, its title heroine is pretty young, very dishy, and spends most of the TV series in a skimpy circus-acrobat outfit that highlights her dishiness.  Also, personality wise, she is ... well ... occasionally bitchy and not immensely smart.</p>
<p>Now like I said, I enjoy the series, but when I think about the idea that it's <em>me</em>, or even more uncomfortably a male animator in some Japanese sweat-shop somewhere, constantly envisioning this fictional girl in this particular way ... it's not a great feeling.  I like the series <em>despite</em> this.</p>
<p>So I was watching previews on another anime disc, and there was this wonderful little girl voice and a warm and loving old-lady voice, and they have the following little exchange:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Little Girl:  Gramma?  Mommy says you have a <em>secret</em> ...<br/>
  Grandma:  Oh ... do you want to know the secret?<br/>
  Little Girl:  Oh, Gramma, pleasssse ....<br/>
  Grandma:  Well I suppose you're old enough now.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And then they shift into ensemble shots of <em>Nadia</em>.  And here's the awesome:  They open with one of the most cheesecakey of scenes (Nadia swinging through the air, bare mid-riff prominent) but it struck me as totally okay ... because now it was the grandmother that I envisioned as narrating.  I could totally hear her in my head saying "Yeah, you might not think it, but back then I was <em>a dish</em>!" and then chuckling.</p>
<p>So I totally don't want to get into the question of cheesecake and fan service in a general sense.  I know there's opinions, but it's a side issue.  What I find fascinating is how the <em>exact same sequences</em> strike me as completely different, depending on how they're framed and who I attribute the narrative voice to.  I feel like there has to be some application to RPGs, though I don't see what it is immediately.</p>

                            On the subject of "the exact same thing feeling really different"...<br/>
<br/>
For my birthday a couple years back, I ran a "League of Extraordinary Americans" game, with Pecos Bill and Casey Jones and the like.  My friend Marta played the most obscene and lecherous version of a disgusting undead pirate (Blackbeard, complete with detachable head) that one could possibly imagine, groping all the female NPCs and constantly making off-color innuendo.  This wasn't just haha funny.  It was like cringe-inducing "I can't believe you went there" stuff, which was hilarious in a slightly uncomfortable way.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone else had started doing that kind of shit, the whole group probably would have told them to knock it off after the first few times, but because it was Marta, she managed to somehow make it semi-okay.  It wasn't just because she was female, because there are other women I've played with that could have totally freaked me out with that shit.  It was something about her delivery, the way the content was communicated.  She wasn't actively targetting people or trying to make people uncomfortable; she was just having fun playing a lecherous undead pirate!  Groping people is what lecherous undead pirates do!  So it was cool.                        </div>

                            OK, so there's the issue Jonathan is pointing out, which we could call the "it's different when <i>you</i> do it" issue. But I'm more curious about this business of in-character narrators that Tony raises.<br/><br/>Has anybody done much with in-character voice-overs and narration? The only time I've done this was when playing The Mountain Witch - all the scenes were framed by me, the GM, narrating <i>as the Witch</i>. I didn't have any particular reason for doing it: it was just a way to make the Witch a presence before he appeared on the scene, plus I enjoyed doing the Witch's voice as Mako/Aku from Samurai Jack. But (imho) it actually had a weird and neat effect on the game: did the Witch's past tense narration mean he had survived? was he watching everything the samurai did? just who was he telling this story to?<br/><br/>I agree with Tony, there's got to be some applications for both scene framing and actual game design.                        </div>

<p>And also ... how do you interpret the samurai, given that you know Aku is narrating them?  Are you (as players) more ready to see their failings, less ready to see their strengths, because that's what you expect the narrator to be presenting you?</p>
<p>What does it mean when you frame a scene with <em>one</em> narrative voice, but then execute it through the co-authorship of many players?  Do they all tend (on some level) to stick to that perspective?</p>

                            Tony, this is a prose-based game, so the issues may be a bit different, but I'm playing in a PBEM right now which explicitly works to try to keep scenes rooted that way.  All of the scenes are kept within a single narrative voice.  Only the player who "called" the scene (it rotates among the players, a bit like in PtA) is playing the narrative voice; the scene is told from her character's subjective point-of-view. The other players called into the scene are "support:" they're there to contribute external details of what their characters are doing and saying - no internal states and as little reflections thereof as possible permitted in their prose.<br/>
<br/>
So far it seems to work quite well at keeping scenes rooted within a single narrative perspective - but then, that's rather specifically what it was designed to do.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the sort of thing you mean?                        </div>

<i>Larry 2 hours ago<br/>Rob is totally my hero for the next hour or so.</i><br/><br/>Drat, I just missed it!<br/><br/>Thanks, Larry. Good call on the Rashomon precedent. That game never made it all the way to the end, as it happened, but if it did I figured the Witch could be narrating from the grave, or have some way to have returned, or whatever.<br/><br/><i>And also ... how do you interpret the samurai, given that you know Aku is narrating them? Are you (as players) more ready to see their failings, less ready to see their strengths, because that's what you expect the narrator to be presenting you?</i><br/><br/>Tony: In the game I'm talking about, I don't actually think the IC-narration affected the players all that much. As I say, i wasn't doing it reflectively or with any particular intent. When the Witch narrated things like "and so, one by one, the foolish samurai inched closer to their doom," it mostly added to the players' desire to get the witch. So they were sort of reacting <i>against</i> the narration. But you could definitely use the tactic to shape scenes in more involved and interesting ways.                        </div>

<p>That's another way I thought they might go ... like "If even <strong>Aku</strong> admits that we're inching closer, and we know he's horribly biased, then we must be <em>really cool</em> in order to force such an admission from him."</p>
<p>Like, if I put on my Aku voice and say "The samurai slew a <em>tiny</em> handful of <em>insignificant</em> servants," with the right emphasis, you all know that the field is littered with the corpses of world-devouring arch-fiends, right?  You can get the effect of people buying narrative bias hook, line and sinker ... <em>or</em> you can manipulate the way they compensate for narrative bias.</p>

                            ROFL!! Yes, that's perfect. And actually there's a lot of good source material (from Rashomon on down) out there to get players into the groove of it.  I am writing a Jade Empire fanfic (SHUT UP YOUR FACE I LIKE FANFIC) with an unreliable narrator and so I am well aware of the great synergy that it can make with certain genres.                        </div>
