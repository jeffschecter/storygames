I tried it last Sunday. <br/><br/>It's very heavily designed to support D&amp;D. Specifically D&amp;D 4e. This is great if that's what you want to play, but a bit awkward if what you're trying to do is play Archipelago.<br/><br/>There is one player who is the GM, who has a bunch of awesome options like the ability to create new pages, a way of controlling a sort of \u201cfog-of-war\u201d thing where you can display parts of a page at a time. Access to music(!) and some very cool in-table search abilities for tokens etc. If I were playing D&amp;D I would be most pleased.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to share GM powers, which means that if you\u2019re not playing D&amp;D, everyone has to wait for the GM to do things like make a new page, or to switch between pages, because players can\u2019t control any of that. It made things very awkward.<br/><br/>They have a really nice Macro system, for any kind of system where you\u2019re using standard modifiers; you can create a simple little die-roll with all your bonuses pre-computer and roll it with a click. It is very handy. I\u2019ve been hoping that Infrno would get something like that for a while.<br/><br/>They\u2019re using TalkBox for voice and video, which works OK but has a loooong lag time. We did some tests after the game and you\u2019re looking at between two and three seconds for a round trip. This worked OK for us, as we were playing with only three people, but with any kind of larger group you\u2019re looking at a lot of accidental talking over each other. <br/><br/>Oh, and you unfortunately don\u2019t seem to be able to remove the map grid. I think there\u2019s supposed to be a way but we never found it. It can also be really confusing trying to select certain items. There's a selection mode for each type of object on the table (Drawings, Tokens, Background, Text) and you need to be in the right mode to select the specific object. It's really quite frustrating. I think they need a single selection tool with filters, because the multiple selection tools just gets awkward. <br/><br/>I was really psyched when I saw that they have support for custom card decks. That is awesome, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to share them between tables (which means that if you wanted to play say, Freemarket, you\u2019d have to recreate the deck every time you created a new game), and right now the cards are pretty useless. There is no support for \u2018hands\u2019 or for doing anything except drawing one card at a time. Once they start getting more support for cards I may end up using it for that feature alone, as there I\u2019ve found nothing that works in that arena thus far.<br/><br/>I thought that it was very pretty, and their technology is amazing, but it\u2019s also very focused on a game I\u2019m not particularly interested in, and in the \u201cGM Controls Everything\u201d model, which was a bit annoying. They\u2019ve only been working on it for a very short period of time though, so I have a lot of hope for them in the future. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382342/#Comment_382342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-14T15:53:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2012  3:53PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have tried it three separate times....I not yet been able to get it to start.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish" title="CoveredInFish"><img alt="CoveredInFish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/940/nWJ86I3UKR7RA.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish">CoveredInFish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382346/#Comment_382346" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-14T16:16:26+00:00" title="June 14, 2012  4:16PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried it and I like what it might get.

You could use tokens, because you can define 'Bars' for them, like hit-points, that have ratings, and I guess you could use one for bennies. Not a very elegant solution, but it could work.<br/><br/>The main bit that convinced me that it was heavily weighted to 4e were the status markers you can apply to various tokens, the macro's (which are perfectly suited for the 4e Powers, you just click the one you want), and the fact that you can't remove the map squares etc. <br/><br/>It would not fit Call of Cthulhu badly, or Fate (they do have Fate dice in their text parser, which is nice), but you'd have to muck about with it a bit to get things comfortable. <br/><br/>It does 4e out of the box; Hitpoints, Powers, Marked, Blooded, Map Combat, Initiative, Fog-Of-War, etc. <br/><br/>It wouldn't be bad with other map combat games like 3.5 or Pathfinder, but there didn't seem to be an easy way to keep track of spell lists. <br/><br/>I may be wrong of course, but the design seemed to be built with 4e in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382399/#Comment_382399" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T00:46:53+00:00" title="June 15, 2012 12:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 12:47AM by zircher.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also very early in development (I'm in the open beta for this), but one proper card handling is set up, it will be much more flexible (make a 'deck' of token and deal/share/discard them.)

(Which still makes it superior to most other virtual gaming desktops, as they have the same problems, but without the "modern".)<br/><br/>Anyway, at the top of a map, there is a grey page icon dangling. Click it to slide out a drawer, containing icons for your maps. Mouse-over any of them and controls appear. One of these is a gear containing settings for the map, including the grid. There is a kind of logic to this, but I can't figure why they wouldn't make these settings more easily available while actually editing that map as well. Their "tool palette" already brutalizes the concept of what a tool palette is by including a bunch of things that aren't "tools" and don't act anything like them, that you wonder why they just didn't add a gear "tool" to bring up that same dialog in the main editor.<br/><br/>Similarly bad interface choices are found in their deck builder. I went through the process of creating a Thoth tarot deck using the tool. Not pleasant, but possible. Now if I could only share it somehow.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382479/#Comment_382479" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T16:59:54+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  4:59PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 5:19PM by Agemegos.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Roll20 went to "beta" testing way short of feature-complete unless considered as a board for playing D&amp;D 3.0, 3.5, and 4, and gives something of the impression that that is what the designers meant by "system agnostic". It's designed to support small-scale exploration and tactical combat, i.e. dungeon-crawling, and was originally presented as supporting only a grid of five-foot squares. It's getting slowly more generic, but that is the hard way to go about developing code. And as it develops its user interface is getting steadily more arcane.<br/><br/>I have used its features to make poker chips that I can distribute to players and that they can move around a FATE layout to support my <i>Spirit of the Century</i> game, and some other beta testers have built index cards for <i>Fiasco</i> and <i>Danger Patrol</i>. But it isn't anything like as easy as it ought to be. In view of the project's stated goals developer effort ought to be going into expanding the card/deck system so that you can actually deal cards, players can hold them, reveal them, play or discard them, etc., and into improving the organisation and management of documents ("handouts" and "journals"), which is awful. Unfortunately most of the playtesters think that "3.0" and "4e" uniquely specify rules sets, so most of the pressure is for improvements to "fog-of-war", dynamic lighting effects, automation of to-hit and damage rolls, movement regulation, grid-cell counting, text-chat scripting, group whispers, party-splitting, automation and computer adjudication of ever more arcane dice interpretation systems, basic arithmetic such as calculating margins of success and multiplying results by three, and other things to make Roll20 more like a computer adventure game. I'm trying to apply countervailing pressure, which is making me pretty unpopular.<br/><br/>I need something like this for long-distance telepresence gaming, and Roll20 will do the job once a few things that are on the developers' roadmap get done, such as card handling. I just hope it keeps a focus on being a simple and general gaming-table emulator and is not driven to become another EVE Online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382485/#Comment_382485" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T18:17:10+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  6:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried it a couple of times, as a player in a pathfinder game.

Overall, I liked it but from my limited experience I can't say too much else about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382504/#Comment_382504" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-16T03:41:42+00:00" title="June 16, 2012  3:41AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, Roll20 went to "beta" testing way short of feature-complete unless considered as a board for playing D&amp;D 3.0, 3.5, and 4, and gives something of the impression that that is what the designers meant by "system agnostic".</blockquote>\nWell, given the numbers of who plays what in the hobby, they ain't too far off. It's a little like saying "religious" when describing Sacramento in 1972 when what you really mean is "Christian".  It does leave those of us who dabble in anthroposophy a little bit grumpy, but for most people it's not exactly wrong.
