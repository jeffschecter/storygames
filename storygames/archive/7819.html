Sometimes no one does.  It's mostly a time to offer and solicite a chance to give opinions, ideas and constructive feedback to make each game session better.<br/><br/>Just wondering if anyone else does this?

Usually we wait 1-2 weeks after the game wraps up to solicit opinions and questions (asking for background details or behind-the-scenes information that the characters never found out in-game are pretty common).<br/><br/>If we try and get feedback right away, it sucks because nothing's really sunk in and no one's prepared to answer anything clearly.  If we wait longer than 2 weeks (and honestly, 2 weeks is really pushing the bleeding edge), it sucks because we've moved on to something new and people are already forgetting details.  After a month it's not even worth asking anymore; you might as well just wait and see what, if anything, about that game gets mentioned whenever the group starts reminiscing about What We've Played.<br/><br/><br/>Usually what our GMs ask about is what people liked and didn't like (as regards scenes, characters, plot points, and/or mechanics); usually what players ask about is clarifications or outright explanations for things that they didn't figure out during the game.  Sometimes it's useful for planning another game, sometimes it's just interesting, sometimes it's self-contradictory and confusing.

In my experience and observation, the folks that commonly get involved in this hobby are generally critical and creative thinkers with imagination and intelligence at a higher average than the general population.  I consider myself on that end of the population and I'm probably the least (technically) intelligent of my gamer groups...  With that, I've also found that (likely) 1 out of 3 people that enjoy our hobby seem to also enjoy the analyzation of the aftermath.<br/><br/>In fact I'd say that MANY of those 1's out of the 3's ARE the people that frequent forums like this to discuss their games.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I love the analyzation and I also know I'm having a blast at the game table.  So I disagree with your claim of lacking happiness....<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>That's a good point; in our group, complaints get made immediately and we try to address them just as swiftly, but .</blockquote>\nRight there's where you've missed my point. <br/>Complaints aren't the only thing you can get from asking questions and feedback.  <br/><br/>I think it's also very helpful, interesting and valuable to get feedback on the negatives AND positives.<br/>Not to mention sometimes somepeople just won't complain.  If you ask it allows them to feel comfortable "complaining" without feeling bad about it.<br/><br/><br/>I also always prompt my groups to give feedback on things OUTSIDE of game as much as in-game fun.  Including things like how they feel about the group interaction,  location,  dynamics,  etc...  If someone loved the fact that a member brought Funyans - mention it!  If someone is bothered that I keep tapping my dice on the table - speak up...  The idea is to be open and honest with your group to improve all conditions.<br/><br/><br/>that's my goal...<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173406/#Comment_173406" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T23:41:30+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 11:41PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2008 11:46PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, not being comfortable complaining is definitely <i>not</i> a problem me or my friends have.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  Similarly, positive social comments are common.  We compliment each other, we make suggestions, we even say things like "we should do more of that" and so on. It's just part of normal social interaction to tell those things to your friends, isn't it?<br/><br/>What I was talking about was the more formalized gaming postmortem, which as I mentioned, is something we also do:  the e-mail sent around, or the roundtable discussion about how the last game went and what we liked or didn't like about it.  And that's a very different animal from our normal "instant feedback," and has not thus far been of much use to us.  Sometimes we get some useful insight out of it, but most of the time we really don't; we're having a good time, and trying to dissect that good time is a lot of effort for very little reward.  So we don't spend a lot of effort on it, and we're happy not spending a lot of effort on it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I get that analysis can be interesting and fun in its own right.  (And also, don't kid yourself, it has nothing to do with being "generally critical and creative thinkers with imagination and intelligence at a higher average than the general population" -- it's way more common than you might think.  It's what our brains are wired to do.)  If that's what floats your boat and you've got the free time for it, hooray for you.  You're free to enjoy what you enjoy.<br/><br/>If it makes you feel better, imagine that I wrote "I think anyone who's not very happy with their gaming is probably more likely to analyze what they're doing in great detail, and might even find it to be extremely useful."  Saying that being unhappy gives a lot of incentive to spend time on introspection and analysis is the flip side of saying that being happy <i>doesn't</i>, after all, and maybe that's a more polite way to put it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173410/#Comment_173410" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T00:23:17+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 12:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>Don't get me wrong, I get that analysis can be interesting and fun in its own right.

In fact it frustrates me (at work) sometimes to see just how little some of my work group are interested in analyzing and pushing toward solutions and considering long-term implications...  rather, most focus on fighting the immediate fires and ignoring the source of the issues.  <br/><br/><br/>I disagree because when you are IN this hobby or you gravitate toward those people (as your friends) with similar interests and ability, you CAN insulate yourself to NOT seeing how the other half think.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's just because I'm highly interested in the psychology of choice...  ie. how/why marketing and brand imagery works.<br/>(for our hobby purpose I also include HOW you GM and role-play a form of brand imagery)<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173477/#Comment_173477" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T08:55:41+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  8:55AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is some motivation for happy people to review and analyze, if they have a burning desire to improve - just as a top athlete doesn't stop training, or ease up on their training, because they are stellar performers in their field. Similarly with certain actors and musicians - they don't rest on their laurels, they hone and improve their craft, rehearse constantly, try out new material in new venues, and so on. It's a certain personality trait (and like all personality traits, either you have it or you don't, and my group doesn't.)  I mean, I analyze the living hell out of my games and I love them to death. But I can completely understand someone who doesn't feel this urge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173486/#Comment_173486" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T09:42:33+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  9:42AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, you're right on. Other creative or competitive situations can have a very similar dynamic. I've been a part of sports teams, bands/orchestras, and similar groups of people that will always discuss afterwards, just to deepen their understanding of what they're doing and how they can improve. Just as importantly, it lets them get to know each other.<br/><br/>As a really different example, sometimes after a birthday party or something like that, I've had detailed chats with friends about the organization: "Hmmm, so and so didn't show up. We need to send invitations next time." Or: "Man, setting up the hors d'oeuvres in the living room really kind of made everyone more social, didn't it?"<br/><br/>I think the common element is people who are interested in the details of what they do. Not just the results (although that's part of it), but the specific details. Like a film fan who wants to know who the director was, where the sets were, who made the costumes, who wrote the soundtrack... the fan finds those details interesting, whether good or bad. Another film watcher, maybe even one who loves films to the point where he or she will starve rather than stop watching them, might only be interested in the experience, and has no need to pick it apart.<br/><br/>In gaming, I'm always frustrated by the lack of feedback. I'd say that, even when trying something radically different and new, maybe one person out of 20 will take the effort to make so much as a comment about it, even after aggressive prompting. As a game designer, I find that incredibly frustrating. I mean, if you gave your best friend a novel you wrote, you'd expect a little more than, "oh, thanks" as feedback, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173562/#Comment_173562" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T12:39:02+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 12:39PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 1:57PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>I mean really...  do you disagree that the hobby attracts people of a higher ability in those areas, similar to the way ... say, hiking attracts people that are more naturally health conscious...</blockquote>\nI'd say we were wandering from the topic of this thread, but hell, you started the thread, you can go wherever you want.  And so my answer is, yes, I disagree.  <br/><br/>I think that gaming as a hobby attracts people who like gaming.  People who are "critical/creative thinkers" or "imaginative/intelligent" can (and do) like doing something else instead, and people who don't meet those rigorous intellectual standards can like gaming.  It's all a rich tapestry.  I completely understand why you'd say otherwise, but I think you are probably just seeing what you want to see (and possibly doing a disservice to people who have different hobbies from yours).<br/><br/><br/>Paul T. and JDCorley both make an excellent point, though.  I'd forgotten about personal competition as a motive.  Probably because I get my competitive juice somewhere else and look at gaming primarily as a relaxing social activity with friends.  That's <i>my</i> blind spot.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and this probably reveals a lot about where I'm coming from:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I mean, if you gave your best friend a novel you wrote, you'd expect a little more than, "oh, thanks" as feedback, right?</blockquote>\nI think that if you give your best friend your novel as a gift, then no, you shouldn't expect more than a thank you.  But if you give it to him and say "I'd like your feedback on this," then yes, you should expect more.  And in the latter case, he should feel free to say "I'd rather not" with no hard feelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173908/#Comment_173908" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T13:29:12+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  1:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, the subtle distinction between "should" and "would"... we are not in disagreement there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
