What do they want? Why can't they get it? How do they go about trying to get it?<br/>   2. What are they like?<br/>   3. And only then, if necessary, the minimum backstory necessary to explain what they're doing in the story of the series.</i><br/><br/>Which is where RPGs generally differ, since they tend to be inverted. We come up with a huge detailed backstory, figure out what they are like, and then completely ignore that first question. They don't want anything. They are static.<br/><br/>Which then makes me think of this post on characters (by another script writer), specifically, Mary Sue characters:<br/><br/><a href="http://seriocity.blogspot.com/2009/01/twilight-of-innocents.html" rel="nofollow">Twilight of the Innocents</a><br/><br/>The quote I really digged on in her post was this one:<br/><br/><i>To me, this is what most procedurals are about. Being plot-driven, a really compelling character would just get in the way. You want characters who will deliver the information that will move the plot forward. You want them to be super-smart, to not be tricked or fooled, to go up against the villains.</i><br/><br/>Since so much of roleplaying is plot-driven (like a procedural), you need these heavy backstory, static characters, because characters with wants who are in motion (characters who can answer number one from above) would do their own thing, ignoring the plot the GM has prepared.<br/><br/>Dynamic and static characters both serve a purpose and neither is better than the other (although most of us probably have a preference, I know I do), however, groups are in trouble if there isn't some kind of consensus about which type should exist in the game they are playing together.<br/><br/>Because static characters in a game that isn't plot driven will just stand around staring at each other boring all the players, and dynamic characters in a plot-driven game will frustrated the players as they tug of war over the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210675/#Comment_210675" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T21:28:01+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  9:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "the group" and "the system" (in the lumpley principle sense) are simply two faces of the same coin.  <br/><br/>Why that desire is frustrated with that group? Because all these cool things are not used/played/added to the SIS. Why?  Because the system used by the group don't allow that use (because the system is based on GM's fiat, because the system include people laughing at anybody who would try to add things like these, or for any other reason). <br/><br/>It's always the system used by the group.

I don't think it's the failings of some games that push people to write more, but the degree to which their chosen game relies on pre-game preparation. A game that relies more on improvised story may discourage such extensive preparation by encouraging people to leave it abstract until it emerges during play. I don't think that's the biggest influence, though.<br/><br/>The biggest influence, I suspect, is the presence of a powerful and inspiring collection of symbols/language within the game. People seem to enjoy exploring "charged" concepts, ideas which imply a great deal more (e.g. the way "knights" imply chivalry, glory, daring, etc.), and the way people explore such concepts is through creating story. A game that inspires people to write a lot before play isn't falling short. The players are so eager to get started that they've started early.<br/><br/>I think that background stories can function like flags and bangs, but can also go beyond, revealing some things that flags and bangs have difficulty conveying, such as desired pacing and tone. It doen't mean that the game that results will be unsatisfying (or that previous games were). Just the opposite, the communication of such things can <i>increase</i> the chance that the resulting games will be satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210680/#Comment_210680" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T22:14:37+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 10:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>A game that inspires people to write a lot before play isn't falling short.</blockquote>\nI don't disagree. I'm not talking about a failing of games/mechanics/texts, but rather a discrepancy between what a particular kind of player wants and what a particular kind of system delivers.<br/><br/>My conjecture, reformulated, states: A player who wants Story Now at the table, but cannot get it within the confines of the system she's playing in, or the group she's playing in, will make a detailed character backstory in an effort to fulfill that desire. It's my belief, based on experience, that that detailed character backstory will not adequately fulfill the desire.<br/><br/>Again, when I read that, I say to myself "duh!".

Despite his good intentions, his undead masters decided they'd rather use their power to fight each other, and had none of the transcendent, watery-eyed zeal that Ex possessed, leaving him feeling like his masters didn't care about "the struggle". This made for great conflict!<br/> The rules didn't really get in the way of this actually, but my group sure did. Out of a huge group (five other players; huge for me), only one other player (also portraying an Abyssal, as it happens) cared about what I had going on with Ex. When Ex forsook his lords to join the Solars (who at least were fighting for something!), the GM gave me a puzzled look and went back to refereeing the last combat scene of the game. Sighhhh <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> For me, it was about scenery-chewing, not writing reams of background, but my abnormal level of chewing set me apart from the group, for the most part. <br/>Hansel, I think I managed to locate an effective way of achieving Story Now for myself without a huge background - Ex was a battlefield looter before he was taken by the death-lords, and ... that was about all I had - that he'd seen a lot of horrible stuff, and death seemed more like a mercy than a terror. Like I said, the player who seems to be interested and energetic about <i>something</i>, but preoccupied, would be the person I would focus on - someone who's really latched onto something, but seems out of step with the rest of the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210696/#Comment_210696" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T05:38:06+00:00" title="June  6, 2009  5:38AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much love to Ron, my brother in Jah, but, man, that's some pretty outrageous stuff.

Example: D&amp;D4 has the concept of quests and mini-quests and my DM wants to have small quests based off each of the characters' interests. My half-elf paladin/bard is super boss, and so, sure, I'd love to write up a page about where he grew up and where his parents are and why he's a paladin, because it's fun, and because it helps with the game.<br/><br/>I will give you that someone who's in a group that they aren't getting what they want out of will seek alternative means of fun.

I took what Hans said more as an "think about this possibility" than as a "everybody do it for the same reason".<br/><br/>And, in any case, it' could be said that writing a lot of background IS the sign that the player want to express something about that character that he can't in play.  But sometimes he can't simply because it is something that take a lot of time and concentration and can't be done at the table, or simply because he don't play enough to satiate his hunger to play that character. But the fact that sometimes it's not a sign of a problem, should not be a reason to forget that that problem exist and should be noticed when it shows up and be avoided.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I get the impression that years of good, fulfilling playing has made a lot of people simply forget how it's "out there", what the common experience of role playing is, for a lot of people.  I am not talking about "we are going to save these poor gamers", it would be silly.  I am simply saying that the push for better game systems came up in the first place because problems as these were (and they still are) very, very common, in a lot of playing group. Saying "it's not a given that everybody do that for this reason" it's not the same as saying "the problem doesn't exist".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210712/#Comment_210712" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T10:00:37+00:00" title="June  6, 2009 10:00AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            still a bit of a leap from problems exist to the players are unfuffiled by your game, and story now could fix it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210718/#Comment_210718" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T11:51:36+00:00" title="June  6, 2009 11:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2009 11:54AM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>Much love to Ron, my brother in Jah, but, man, that's some pretty outrageous stuff. Sometimes fun is just fun. Sometimes people write character histories because it's a good time. And sometimes, it even matters for the game. Example: D&amp;D4 has the concept of quests and mini-quests and my DM wants to have small quests based off each of the characters' interests. My half-elf paladin/bard is super boss, and so, sure, I'd love to write up a page about where he grew up and where his parents are and why he's a paladin, because it's fun, and because it helps with the game.</blockquote>\n<br/>That's fair. I hadn't put a lot of thought into what I said. It was simply an "Aha! This idea makes sense to me in this way, let me put it up and see what other people think." I certainly didn't mean to attribute <i>all</i> detailed character histories as springing from being unsatisfied with play at the table.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>I will give you that someone who's in a group that they aren't getting what they want out of will seek alternative means of fun. That's nearly a truism.</blockquote>\nAnd this is where I get my "duh." Yeah, that's pretty much all I'm saying.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I took what Hans said more as an "think about this possibility" than as a "everybody do it for the same reason".</blockquote>\nYes, thank you!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>still a bit of a leap from problems exist to the players are unfuffiled by your game, and story now could fix it.</blockquote>\nWell, yeah, it is a leap. It's all conjecture, and in some cases it's pretty obvious conjecture (see Clinton's truism).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
