                    I think Ron's recent <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20791.msg216100#msg216100" rel="nofollow">classification of the differnt types of authority</a> is great. It really helps the way I think about my designs. To review, Ron divides authority into 4 types:
<blockquote><b>Content authority</b> - over what we're calling back-story, e.g. whether Sam is a KGB mole, or which NPC is boinking whom<br/><br/><b>Plot authority</b> - over crux-points in the knowledge base at the table - now is the time for a revelation! - typically, revealing content, although notice it can apply to player-characters' material as well as GM material - and look out, because within this authority lies the remarkable pitfall of wanting (for instances) revelations and reactions to apply precisely to players as they do to characters<br/><br/><b>Situational authority</b> - over who's there, what's going on - scene framing would be the most relevant and obvious technique-example, or phrases like "That's when I show up!" from a player<br/><br/><b>Narrational authority</b> - how it happens, what happens - I'm suggesting here that this is best understood as a feature of resolution (including the entirety of IIEE), and not to mistake it for describing what the castle looks like, for instance; I also suggest it's far more shared in application than most role-players realize.</blockquote>
As an exercise, I tried analyzing <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, and this is what I came up with:<br/><br/><b>In general</b>:<br/>- Narrational authority is shared fairly equally between participants.<br/>- Plot authority--for the most part--is an emergent property of play, and depend heavily on resolution (more in a minute).<br/>- Situational authority--for the most part--is the sole domain of the GM (more in a minute).<br/>- Content authority is the sole domain of the players.<br/><br/><b>General Play</b>:<br/>Grants narration over PCs in the hands of the players, and narration of everything else in the hands of the GM. As such, a good deal of plot is developed just by this "free play".<br/><br/><b>Resolution</b>:<br/>Creates plots directly by deciding success/failure plus degree of success. Resolution also grants narration over conflict participants to the conflict winner, the effect being that narration of conflicts gets shared over the course of the game.<br/><br/><b>Trust</b>:<br/>Trust mechanics--specifically the act of granting Trust--creates content by establishing relationships between PCs.<br/><br/><b>Fates</b>:<br/>Here things get interesting. Fates are the near sole source of content in the game (with the exception of Trust). For the most part, players create the content for their own PC, though Fates also allow players to create some content for other PCs (Revenge, for example, though other Fates can do it too) and NPCs (Yuki-Onna, the Witch, the history of mythical Japan, etc). Fates also allow a certain degree of plot authority (as in the revelation of content), situational authority (as it allows players to frame scenes), and narrational authority (as it allows players to narrate revelations ans such).<br/><br/><b>Comments</b>:<br/>Realizing that players create content, the GM creates situation, and plot emerges from content+situation+narration was really helpful for understanding more clearly how the game works.<br/><br/>I think "context" might be a better word than "content" for back-story-type authority.<br/><br/>This might be stretching the topic, but I think the idea of plot-as-an-emergent-function-of-play might be a defining feature of story-games (not of RPGs in general, but this emerging <i>thing</i> of thematic play).                </div>
