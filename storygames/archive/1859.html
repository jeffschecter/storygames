                    Hey guys and gals,<br/><br/>So there's something really important that we're starting to talk about. You can see it in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1784&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1846&amp;page=1#Item_43" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, and I posted a little somthin somthin <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2006/11/07/tired-of-awesome/" rel="nofollow">on my blog recently</a> (read the comments!). In those comments, Jason Morningstar sez 
<blockquote>The larger issue of enthusiastic support without meaningful critique isnâ€™t so cyclical, I suspect.</blockquote>
So, lets talk about giving meaningful critique.<br/><br/>This means, among other things:<br/><br/>*Playing games and reading texts actively, with a level of concious attention to how those both are communicating for you and your group.<br/><br/>*De-coupling how you feel about a person from what you think about your game; and, conversely, accepting that criticism of your game is not criticism of you as a person.<br/><br/>*Naming actual games in discourse when making critical or negative points about play.<br/><br/>*Giving and receiving recommendations for other games to read and play without feeling like you're saying that the designers game is worse than or not at the same level as those games - we can all learn from each other.<br/><br/>*Writing Actual Play post that hilight the problems or issues you had in play alongside the fun and good experiences. <br/><br/>I think that the best way to give thanks to this community and everything it has done for us over the last couple of years is to work on making it better by cultivating a culture of meaningful critique. Let's talk about it.                </div>

<p>Someone told me that management consultants have the guideline of "share 4 good things for every 1 bad one". Maybe if you're feeling stalled, this is a good guideline? If you have a hard time finding at least one good thing to bring into alongside the criticism, perhaps you're just going to have hard time connecting at all with the author in the discussion?</p>
<p>Here's one problem case: what if your feedback is (negatively) critical to something that is at the game's core? Like if I said to Matt Snyder: "The cards? they're really distracting, and take away from Dust Devils for reasons X, Y, and Z." How can I frame that more constructively, when there is really a lot of pride at stake here?</p>
<p>My possible suggestions: if your criticism is clearly directed at the game's core, first make sure that you both have some reasonable shared interest in the game (ex: at least we both love Westerns), and frame your criticism as describing what doesn't make the game work for <em>you</em>; then frame the positive feedback as how the author would construct a future game that included you again as a possible audience.</p>

                            *Criticism is doing you a favour. If someone takes time to talk about your game and some stuff they thought wasn't working, they are helping you out even if you think they are an idiot, were playing it wrong, or have missed the point. It's not particularly fun to step up and say negative things to another person, especially if you share a community. Every time a critic gets shouted down by a designer - particularly when the designer is a bigger community name for whatever reason - it chills criticism. Criticism stemming from that critic or from the general community; criticism directed towards that designer or to others in the community.<br/><br/>As a starter, I thought Jesse got a pretty hard time in his SotC thread. Maybe he was wrong or framed his criticism bluntly, but when Fred started shouting him down I thought that was a real shame.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about smiling and nodding inanely and agreeing with things you disagree with, but if it's not possible to hear things about your game that you disagree with and be amicable, then the community is not going to offer you criticism about your game. I mean, what is more important, being friends with the furiously awesome Orlando Furioso, or provoking animosities within your preferred online hangout and risk being tagged as someone who 'just doesn't get it', merely to <i>maybe </i>make his game a bit better?                        </div>

<p>So, here's a thing. I don't think a public place is a good environment for critique. In recent times, I have been providing it privately. It is easier to be honest and uncompromising about a thing when you're not bundling it with a bunch of prying eyes.</p>

                            Shreyas, if you're providing that stuff that's great - it's a necessary component. But private criticism doesn't cover all the bases. if I think Orlando's last game just doesn't work as written for long-term play, and tell him so privately, where exactly does that get you and everyone else on the outside in making informed choices on what to buy or play? <br/><br/>Personal communication can also risk lapsing into premature conciliation; if I am worried about offending Orlando and he is worried his game is going to get a bad rep then we can slide into personal validation and agree that "yup, I was probably making too much of it" and "yup, not all games are easy on the first try, you're doing great" and we're both neat people in the hobby for excellent reasons. A more formal approach, which is part of what a public approach throws you, helps avoid this.<br/><br/>Also, if I have a nub of a critique that someone else might jump on and take places, it's going to get addressed better in a public forum.                        </div>

                            For once I agree with Shreyas. <br/><br/>I'll also note that I've noticed of late that my playtesting style (when I actually got to do it) has changed. Back in the day when I was playtesting for White Wolf or Wild Talents I was brutal on the system and the prose. I would not try hard to figure out what the text was trying to say, I would take everything at face value and do exactly what the document actually said. I wouldn't explain things to my players who'd read the document to make sure we were on the same page, I'd have us all read it and then come together and play to see if what was supposed to happen happened. I would give no benifit of the doubt, and even when something wasn't "broken" I would write down very specifically everything I didn't like, thought could work better, or was at all confusing. Dennis Detwiller once told me I was more brutal than an angry thesis commite (or something like that). He also told me that I was one of the best playtesters on the project. <br/><br/>I noticed, while reading over In a Land Called the other day (comments are coming Tim! I'm slow, I know, but they'll get there) I realized I wasn't doing that. I was giving the text the benifit of the doubt. I was trying to figure out what things really meant. Now, to be fair to both Tim and I, ILC isn't exactly almost ready for print -- but I was still doing more work to bridge the understanding gap than I would have in the old days. <br/><br/>When I did a very short stint of idea/process testing for Full Light Full Steam I was a little more rigorous, becuase I know Josh and know that he can take it when I tell him, "this part here makes no fucking sense." In that case I did the whole thing Josh asked me to and made it work, but also left notes all through telling Josh where I found the system difficult, underexplained, or over-stressed or whatever. Josh seemed to like what I had to say, told me I was all useful and everything, despite the fact I told him he needed to change a good number of things and wasn't always sweet about it. (I can't claim any credit for the awesomeness of FLFS, however. It went through severl cycles after me that were all even more helpful.) <br/><br/>There have been a few other games that I've been looking over playtest documents of recently and found myself going, "Oh that's rough, but I know what he means so that's good enough...." and then having to slap myself in the face. When you're playtesting you're not there to be nice, you're there to be a friend. The kind of friend who tells you when you stink and need to take a shower. <br/><br/>Now, talking about a published game is even rougher because we know there is money and serious pride on the line. So private for personal talks may be best. I know I've had a few one on ones with folks where I've been able to get points across that may not have been doable in public because they know that in private they're not under attack, at risk of losing sales, or likely to lose any respect. So, yea, private. <br/><br/>However, all of that isn't even the full issue that I was getting at in one of the linked threads in the first post here. There is also an issue not just of criticism but of honesty about what games do and are and are not good for. You know when I started seriously looking at Burning Wheel? When Luke told someone it wasn't the game they were looking for. I respected his honesty and his ability to objectivly look at his own work and know what its strengths and weaknesses were. OTOH, I've seen lots of well meaning fans of a system pimp it even when it is obviously inapropriate, even when someone has said they don't like the system, and then go on to tell them how they are wrong about not liking it. <br/><br/>That too is part of being able to think critically about our games and the games we like. Recommending PTA to someone who tells you to your face that they like critical hit rules is not doing PTA a favor.<br/><br/>I think that gets to be where I start to overlap with Alex. Once a game is out, once you're responding to people asking questions about it, you still have to have some objectivity and honesty. Both about what is good in the game and about what might not fit their play, about the issues other people have had with the game, and about what the game should not be used for. Be honest about what you like about the game, but don't be an apologist.                        </div>

<p>Well, the thing is, this has <em>very little</em> to do with critique. You need to take someone's desires into account when you inform them about games, right, so if they say, "I want an extremely light game without any setting, is Burning Wheel a good choice?" you say, "It's the wrong game for that goal because of X Y Z. I suggest maybe Shadows, because of U V W." I don't need to dump on a game in public to help people make good choices.</p>

                            I think there's a fundamental difficulty with doing serious criticism of indie RPGs.  Standards.<br/><br/>What I mean here is that I might criticise a game, let's say it's Matt Snyder's quite fun <i>Nine Worlds</i> (I'm using this example because I've done it...).  And I say 'The game doesn't work for me at points X and Y' and Matt responds 'X and Y are what make the game work for me, they're what make the game sing'.<br/><br/>As long as the standard is 'This is what I like/don't like in my play' then we can't really do criticism.  We can write reviews, and we can be critical, but I don't know how far we'll get.  The best standard we have at the moment is the GNS split.  We can meaningfully talk about games as good for one or the other (well, in theory anyway, I don't think the GNS thing is widely enough understood to be truly useful for criticism yet).<br/><br/>I hope the difficulty is relatively clear here: we can't really be critical because we don't have standards to be critical against.  We can provide feedback of the 'This didn't work for me' sort, but that's not criticism because the answer might be 'That's because you are playing it wrong/don't have the necessary context to make it work/whatever'.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, <br/><br/>Any system can be judged by whether or not the system meets is stated objectives. Criticizing a system against its stated objectives can be done, but (as you say) is often a waste of time. Both are different than criticizing the objectives themselves, which can also be done and can also be useful. <br/><br/>If Matt says "I want Nine Worlds to do X and Y" and it doesn't, you tell him it doesn't and you tell him why. Simple. Even if it is a "doesn't for me" then it can be helpful because we are not unique snowflakes and any problem we have with the system not doing what Matt wants it to will be a problem someone else will have as well. <br/><br/>Yo can also criticize the objectives themselves with greater and lesser degrees of cognizence depending on your relation to the person, game, and knowledge of their goals. I'd probably have some criticism of a game that had a goal of "help guys score with drunk chicks at cons" for an easy and cheap example.  <br/><br/>Really, its no different than criticizing any creative work. Did "The Departed" do what it wanted to? Are you complaining because it wasn't funny enough and is that relevant once you realize it isn't a comedy? Is it even worth the sound and fury to remake a movie that had a masterful orriginal? <br/><br/>And so it goes.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite>I think there's a fundamental difficulty with doing serious criticism of indie RPGs.  Standards.</blockquote>
Do you feel like the same limitation exists in film criticism, art criticism, or literary reviews? Because they all seem to me to be producing a lot of very healthy criticism (along with a lot of very poor criticism) despite having no objective or even explicitly-agreed-upon standards for what makes a good film, a good painting, or a good book. In fact, a large part of criticism in all those media is establishing what you think is worth being critical about -- i.e. setting your own standards as a critic. And then some critics come along and they generalize their standards into a school of criticism, etc. etc. But it still all starts in the wasteland of 'well I don't think this book is any good' or 'this book makes me weak in the knees and here's why.' <br/><br/>I can't really think of any form of criticism that does not exist under the limitations you discuss, unless you start calling scientific review 'criticism' -- in which case I think you're really reaching, if you somehow want RPGs to be analyzed in the same way.<br/><br/>People who care enough to be critics of other people's work will inevitably care enough to consider and articulate their own standards. As more and more people give real criticism, standards will emerge. Trying to create standards before engaging in meaningful criticism is, I think, a mistake. And by 'real criticism' I am simply referring to what everyone else is talking about as well. I think there's already a lot of it out there -- the more we create and the more dialogue there is around the criticism that exists, the easier it will be to discern the standards at work.                        </div>

                            Not to jump on the Disagree With Thomas train here, but I actually find indie RPGs to be <em>better</em> suited to be objects of criticism than most other aesthetic works, since RPG books typically tell the reader what kind of play the design should produce.  If the book says the game provides "fast paced wuxia action!" and then restricts exactly how far your character can jump and combat always grinds to a standstill, the game is obviously not living up to its marketing.<br/><br/>I think perhaps RPG criticism, as a "field," has historically been really really bad at identifying what a given RPG is attempting to accomplish -- it's all too common for gamers to assume that their roleplaying is all roleplaying and judge all books by the measure of their praxis -- but I think that's an opportunity for improvement, not an insurmountable obstacle.                        </div>

                            This may sound defensive, but I hope not.  I'm not actually upset with people disagreeing or anything, but I did want to clarify...<br/><br/>No game that I have seen to date has provided you with all the procedures needed to play it.  This isn't anything special, no film teaches you how to watch it and no book teaches you how to read it.  At least in a strict sense.<br/><br/>Let's look at <i>My Life with Master</i> (because I think it's brilliant and like to play it): there are no rules about how to make sure that your character holds your interest.  No mechanics for making characters sympathetic, for instance.  I think that in some sense it is fair to criticize MLwM for this.  For some groups I've played with it is failing to provide a vital set of techniques for effective play.<br/><br/>But!  For other groups I've played with such mechanics are not needed.  We can provide our own intriguing characters, no need for Paul to give us rules for that.  (Note that I'm assuming that one of the goals in MLwM is that the PCs are intriguing to the players, maybe it's not...)<br/><br/>So the problem here is that the game does not (and can not) provide all the tools necessary for play.  Which would be a problem in other media except that we have baseline competency expectations.  You can read, you know how to watch tv and film, you know how to listen to music.  We don't have such an expectation for roleplaying.  What would minimum competency look like?  What can we really expect players to be good at and what should designers be expected to provide?<br/><br/>I hope my point is somewhat clear, even as rambly as this feels...  I guess a lot of this grows out of my perception that most serious attempts at criticism in our community are responded to with something along the lines of 'That's because you lack technique X or assumption Y which is necessary to play but is not part of the game'.  And that's a fair answer, I guess.  I mean, I'd say it's valid to answer some criticisms of <i>Paradise Lost</i> with 'Well of course you don't get it, you haven't read enough of the Old Testament which is an important part of understanding the work but isn't part of it.'<br/><br/>Okay, that's really rambly, and I think I've lost sight of what I was saying.  Hopefully there's something useful there anyway.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

But of course there are a lot of books and films and music out there that produce very similar questions. Questions which are then dealt with by critics, who write about the works with that larger dialogue in mind, or (even) solely to make a point in that larger dialogue. I would say, for example, that reading any poet worth their salt will almost necessarily involve learning a new way of reading. Others might disagree. Jazz is notorious for producing these kind of 'well you just aren't listening right' responses. Complaints and debates over 'difficult' works are ongoing, critics complain equally about films being excessively dense and excessively facile. And, basically, everyone has to find their own place.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that not only is criticism already happening, but what you describe is, in fact, criticism -- moreover, your description itself is in part stating a critical position. Or at least, uncertainty about what critical position is best. So maybe I'm casting my 'criticism' net wider than you'd like, but my intention is to be optimistic, not dismissive. I think your points about how reviews are handled is good -- but reviews of specific works are only part of a larger dialogue.<br/><br/>And I think that anyone who answers a criticism that a game asks too much of its players with the claim that players should just fill in the blanks is obviously missing the point; on the other hand, how many reviews articulate the issue that way, and how many just flatly say "this game didn't do X"? It's the same kind of difference you see between some random radio jock saying "this movie sucked!" and Roger Ebert writing a full-page explanation of the weaknesses of the movie. The latter deserves a much more considered response. The latter is what we are presumably hoping to encourage. But while it's true that Roger Ebert probably knows a lot of fancy film words, what makes him a good critic has more to do with a lifetime spent watching and writing about movies than anything else. <br/><br/>Equally important is the fact that when he wrote about film in that way, people were willing to respond in kind. They didn't (all) shout him down and they didn't (all) nod sycophantically. So a space for criticism and a healthy atmosphere about it is also important, which I think is part of what people are concerned about. Or maybe they're concerned that other people's concern about potentially being seen as 'mean' is stopping them from giving honest feedback. I have to admit, posting a scathing critical review about anything on Story-Games would seem entirely against the character of the board -- quadruply so if it was the game of a board regular.  It just doesn't seem to be in line with the goals of the board.                        </div>

                            I can't help but consider this the most complex issue we've faced as a community. It's a snarl that entangles our friendships with money matters, creative aspirations, and self esteem. So it incites us to passion in our viewpoints.<br/><br/>And so here we're talking solutions--a culture of criticism. But do we actually have a clear articulation of the problem we're trying to solve? Is the lack of criticism the problem? Or a proposed solution? <br/><br/>Here's my swag at the problem: some of us have published games that aren't fully baked.<br/><br/>And this reality gives rise to various concerns. Will our market contract when customers recognize they can't trust our games like they once could? Will these half baked games distract potential customers from my own game? Etc.<br/><br/>But these are just concerns. They aren't problems yet. We need to set them aside...and work on the actual problem. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the current conversation about public criticism has proven so emotionally complex and problematic for the community because it's too far downstream of the problem. I think we should have a culture of public criticism of published games, but I'm dubious the current reality of the community can digest it. I believe what we need is a solution that's upstream of publication. In particular:<br/><br/>1. Increasingly, designers are developing what they consider their best game ideas behind closed doors. I think we need a return to public development. Art teasers and snippets of color text are not public development. Ask Matt Snyder how Dust Devils benefited from public development.<br/><br/>2. I think we need to reinvigorate our culture of giving public feedback to designers.<br/><br/>3. POD technology makes it too easy to publish a game that looks done when it's not. I think we need to install the indie community with an appreciation for publishing and selling ashcan rulebooks that look like games in progress, not like fully baked games.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

I wrote about this a little while ago, but I made the wrong choice in rushing through the design/publishing process with Perfect.<br/>I shortchanged myself and the game, somewhat, by feeling like "getting it out the door" was what was important.<br/><br/>It's a mistake I think is common for a lot of people, not just me.<br/>The need to feel like I was "part of the community" was huge - even though I didn't realize it at the time. I felt like I had to hurry up and prove myself, or something like that.<br/><br/>Now that I've learned (at least some of) that lesson, I feel kind of stupid about it.<br/>I'm proud of Perfect and think it rocks, but wonder how much MORE it could have been with several months more playtesting, bringing an ashcan version to Gencon, spending more time on the prose, etc.<br/><br/>Here's what would have helped me, in retrospect:<br/>*A few people volunteering to do outside playtests for Perfect.<br/>*more explicit criticism, and a willingness to back that criticism up.<br/><br/>Here's some stuff I think is important for me to do (next time):<br/>*Playtest at several cons, with several groups, and externally.<br/>*Have an ashcan/playtest copy of the game to give to people.<br/>*Don't set deadlines for the sake of having tight deadlines.<br/>*I had a volunteer editor/layout person, and I pushed him to get it done QUICK (see one line above), and that was a pisspoor thing to do. If someone volunteers to help you, as a critic or editor or artist or anything, don't be a dick by demanding they meet a schedule.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Cross-posted with JBR's enthusiastic backing of Paul's points. Which I also enthusiastically back.                        </div>

                            Paul, <br/><br/>I can support all of that. <br/><br/>I'd add, however, that public help in development does require the "critical playtesting" skills that I was talking about. I've seen a few games that were done partly in public over the last little while that didn't get the stuff they deserved because, basically, everyone was playing to nice and to light.                        </div>

                            Oh, and as to ashcan games that look like their in development: <br/><br/>I hold up as a model that seemed to have generated a lot of positive results in many ways the comic book sized pre-release of <i>With Great Power</i>. <br/><br/>Obviously not a full finished game, even says so on the cover. Got Michael feedback, some public development cycle, notice, and some money to help with the eventual release. That he also added a discount on the final version for those who bought the preview was just good marketing. <br/><br/>I'd also add that Jarred has repeatedly screamed at us (or me, at least) that doing a .pdf as proof of concept and initial release before we get to the print stage is often a very solid bussiness and development idea. It's so easy to go to print now that a lot of us skip that step, and I don't know if its always the best idea. <br/><br/>Hell, Green MainstreamGames Ronin has benifited recently from doing .pdf releases first (though it isn't quite the same model as they aren't proving concpet so much) so why should we be too proud?                        </div>

                            I also agree with Paul.  Post-publishing criticism can only do so much, unless we really want to start having a Second Edition culture.  Far better to get lots of play and criticism in before a game has a commercial release.  Limited free or low-cost early printings of a game may help ensure it gets played (as we talked about in earlier discussions about printing = play), but rushing games to press is lame.<br/><br/>Thing is, I feel like this is a lesson most often learned by folks after they put out a product they're not 100% happy with.  It's really difficult for someone who wants to publish their game and wants to join this mythic club of "published game designers" to let their project stew for a while, especially with the ease of publishing nowadays.<br/><br/>I do think, as I said earlier, that there really isn't a community yet that really supports semi-experienced designers who want to talk about design and play.  The Forge is terrific at helping people looking to get started at indie game publishing.  It's not really set up to support in-depth discussions of specific projects that are being prepared for publication, except in, say, the Secret Playtest Forums that are occasionally set up for particular projects.  Sounds like what we need is a site set up to host a bunch of Non-Secret Playtest Forums for Individual Projects, where it would easily show you which projects have been updated recently and where members could subscribe to feeds for specific projects or designers they were interested in. Vanilla wouldn't actually be such a bad choice for that kind of thing, but it's not really in the mission of Story Games.<br/><br/>Christian, I also used to believe that playtesting was hard to come by, but now, between Story Games Boston and Indie Netgaming, I don't feel like I have that excuse anymore.  I mean, hell, SGB meets every week to play pick up indie games and we'd totally be willing to playtest just about any project that was in a near-complete ready-to-play form.  And we have a nice crowd that like 50% hardcore indie games people (me, Dev, Nathan, sometimes Jared) and about 50% interested gamers who are less invested in our rather incestuous community.<br/><br/>However, the key to good playtesting, I think, it to treat it like PLAY and not like a PLAYTEST, if that makes any sense.  It's sometimes hard for people to get excited about playtesting, but it is easy to get people excited about playing a hot new game.  If you have an open call for playtesters, you get no response.  If you post your hot new game, people will play it, even if there are still some aspects that need work.                        </div>

                            Hey, Brand.<br/><br/>I'm a little different from most forgie designers in that I like non-play feedback as well as play feedback.  So, if you've only got one, send it over.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Isn't post publication criticism a review? Isn't that a valuable activity to the buyer? If not the publisher?<br/>
<br/>
Look, no RPG is perfect. Criticism is hard to take. I learned that the hard way. But it won't kill your sales, it'll make your buyers more informed. If the criticisms are valid, then you can use them for your second edition, if that's planned.<br/>
<br/>
We're not arguing that we should go back to the culture that existed before where RPGs went largely uncritiqued, are we?<br/>
<br/>
If we're just saying "watch the context" or something, well, sure, fine.<br/>

                            Just to clarify, what exactly IS an "ashcan" copy?<br><br>To answer Thomas, everyone has a different perspective, a different angle, so what we need is a corpus of reviews. Not a dozen reviews of say Nobilis, but 50 reviews of one Dan Davenport, that way you can get to know his tastes, his assumptions and so on and so forth.<br><br>What we need is not wide, but deep, we don't need critique, we need criticizers.<br>We replace that by exchanging ideas with those who review/critique on message boards, but those who come only for the reviews are without that.<br><br>That's my two cents, aside from, Mr. Walton, that's playtesting for you to give, but it does not translate into easy playtesting for us to receive.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey Guy,<br><br/>An "ashcan" is a print copy of a game that looks nicer than a corner stapled printout, and more like a book, but is still clearly a work-in-progress. Think saddle-stitched, tape-bound, or comb-bound. Typically they have a copy-shop or hand-crafted aesthetic.<br/><br/>Paul                        </br></div>
