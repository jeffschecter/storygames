I wanted to try Gregor Hutton's game Remember Tomorrow, which is a GM-less game for telling cyberpunk stories with 2-5 (ideally 3+) players. I had a few concerns at the start, but the game worked beautifully. <br/><br/>My first concern was that I was the only fan of the genre. This was no big deal, everybody was able to make interesting characters and compelling stories. I was free to rip off Neuromancer as much as I wanted, since none of them had read it.<br/><br/>My second concern was that I was the only experienced / willing GM at the table, and RT is GMless in the sense that everyone essentially takes a turn being the GM (the game text calls this temporary role the Controller). Most of the game was played from an author stance, but this worked fine. I suspect with a different group there would be a lot more actor stance, and that would create some memorable moments we missed out on, but everybody had a good time anyway. More importantly (to me anyway), I find myself thinking about the characters and situations days later.<br/><br/>I suspect this game is very setting - hackable, to the point that I'm surprised it's not talked about more. There is a specific tone required, though, because the characters cannot team up against some external foe. All the action is driven by factions 'attacking' (not necessarily physically / directly) the PC's, and there is strong incentive for the PC's to make deals with the factions, stabbing each other in the back in the process. You're not going to hack this into a fighter, thief, cleric, wizard dungeon crawl, but you could have a fantasy game where an aspiring warlord, guild leader, archbishop / prophet, and wizard chase their ambitions, and leave havoc in their wake.<br/><br/>I only really have two complaints, and they are both fairly minor. The first is that in our game, all three PC's had exits where they accomplished their goals, and this doesn't really fit the genre. I'm not sure how much of this is the game, and how much is what we did with it, so it could easily just be our fault. The second complaint is that sometimes there is an obvious scene which would be cool, but it doesn't fit the choices for scene types you are given as controller. You can introduce a character, introduce a faction, have your PC make a deal with a faction, or throw a character or faction against somebody else's PC as antagonism (the real engine for story). Your turn is your turn as controller, not the time for your character to take spotlight and advance his or her goals. Those choices keep you on that track, but I'd still like to see a way to get more options, perhaps at some cost.<br/><br/>So, those are my thoughts on Remember Tomorrow after playing it once. I dig it and I'd happily play it again.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439653/#Comment_439653" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-23T23:08:17+00:00" title="October 23, 2014 11:08PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2014 11:09PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did a swords &amp; sorcery hack that was very successful.

In our hack you never lose checks towards your story goal, but the third check is win or lose: if you fail you are written out.

You guys must have played pretty fast?<br/><br/>Ben, that fantasy hack sounds awesome! For some reason I associate fantasy settings with more focused group play (read: the "party"), and that's not at all what Remember Tomorrow will provide, so that's cool.<br/><br/>Very subjectively I wanted a little more theming/setting in the book. I'm sure it works great as written when you have cyberpunk afficionados in the group but there might be better ways of alluding to a potential default setting in the game text. JJ Prince's Dragon vs Gun comes to mind: very open in what kind of a setting you end up playing, but with a strong default setting baked into the text.<br/><br/>One hack I remember us using was to use the world creation from Shock and then play out the game in Remember Tomorrow. This isn't to say we didn't like Shock--they're very different games--but we did end up with a particularly fun game of RT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440795/#Comment_440795" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-10T09:44:19+00:00" title="December 10, 2014  9:44AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've only played Remember Tomorrow at cons, but I seemed to remember that you wouldn't likely be able to reach your goal in a single session.

Those are <i>episode</i> goals, and while an episode is not guaranteed to fit within a single session, that's not unusual either.<br/>To me, that an episode could be split over many play sessions sometimes feels like a design weakness. It felt like a strength when we were playing a 2-players game in very short installments while traveling, though.\n<blockquote>Very subjectively I wanted a little more theming/setting in the book.
