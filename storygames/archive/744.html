<div class="Message">
                    So, I've been teaching a game design class all week - which was originally supposed to be for college students and faculty, but got switched around to be for a wide cross-section of high-schoolers here in Pensacola.  Originally I was disappointed with the change, but it's actually been an absolutely fantastic experience which I've been ranting about on <a href="http://www.replayable.net/blog/" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>.<br/><br/>Back when I was planning the course, I asked for suggestions for games that I could run with kids of this age, figuring that hey, why not hook them on indie stuff while I'm talking about the function of game mechanics and the connection between story and system.  People were extremely helpful - but in retrospect, I'm really glad that I prepared both for the best and for the worst, because I don't think I could have successfully played a single one of the suggested games with this group.  (Some of them, yes, but only maybe 1/3 of them at the max.)  Instead I ran a game of <i>Dread</i> (the Jenga version) and a super-simplified game of FUDGE pirates, which was about the maximum complexity they could handle.<br/><br/>Based on this week's experience, it seems that when we think about teaching games, we often think about teaching kids who are "just like us" when we were kids - but the thing is, we're the role-playing success stories.  It's hard, at least for me, to understand just how different the experience of other kinds of kids might be.  <br/><br/>Here are some of the problems I ran into, which I hope we can take as design challenges for figuring out how to make role-playing more approachable.  After all, these kids are our next generation of role-players!  The kids who were the most troubled (held back in school, learning-disabled, low self-esteem/family problems) are the ones who opened up like flowers in the role-playing activities - so it's not just good for us, it's good for them.  One girl's mother told me that she hadn't opened her mouth in the classroom for a year or more, but in the game I ran she was throwing herself in, having fun, and asking if we could run more of it the next day.  This is Important Stuff, at least for the group I've been working with.<br/><br/>- About half the kids cannot read.  I gave them a half-page rules summary, and this group of kids looked at it and said, "I really want to play, but it's going to take me half an hour to read that and understand what it means."  (Not in so many words, but one did ....)  Can we create games that are easier to read, or that aren't text-dense with the starter rules, or that have an easier vocabulary without being dumbed-down?<br/><br/>- Many of them don't want to spend a lot of time learning the system.  If they have to struggle with it, they will give up.  It's really important for them to feel like they are in charge and capable, because they will give up if they can't solve the problem or if they feel like they are "doing it wrong."  Many of them fear taking risks, even in play - and, I imagine, rightfully so given the experiences they've had in school so far.  Can we decrease the risk of "playing wrong" while still making things dramatic?<br/><br/>- They are not happy about sharing the spotlight, particularly the ADHD crowd.  I was trying to run a dramatic combat scene, with half of them holding off the attacking mob and half fighting the pirate king.  While I was switching my attention back and forth literally every three minutes, the kids who weren't currently acting were constantly complaining and really, really upset about not having my attention.  This may be an artifact of them liking me as a teacher, but I think it's also a design challenge that we might have to consider.  Attention is a scarce, powerful resource. <br/><br/>- The more real-life experience of failure the kid had, the more they seemed to want excitement and success in the game.  While we can design cool narrative indie we-love-adversity games all we want, if we want to try to reach these kids, we have to give them what they want.  They didn't seem to mind dying horribly in the horror story - as long as they were cool and successful doing it - so I don't think it's as simple as character power = success = happy players.  But this bears analysis and thought, because they didn't seem to want either immersion or drama in the senses that we think about them.<br/><br/>I know we've already got some discussions open about class, gender, etc., but I really wanted to share my experiences, particularly with the academically troubled kids in the group.  I'd like to try to figure out some other concrete differences, and maybe to design some role-playing exercises for the next time I run something like this.  In an ideal world, I'll be working on a brief curriculum that any game designer can take into a classroom (and one for educators, that they can use to teach about game design), and I'd appreciate the help of the collective genius of this group.<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>(Edited for coherence, and to point out that anyone who helps with this curriculum development will totally get credited.  Go Story-Games!)                </div>

It's still a wee bit too long for this purpose, but it at least suggests one way to get at it.<br/><br/>However, having taught reading and done some roleplay and simulations in the classroom myself, I think the best solution to this problem is to ditch the idea that RPGs have to be transmitted through books and the written word.  I suspect that a <em>large</em> portion of the LARPing crowd consists of folks who got into it and learned the local system either without any reading or with purely supplementary and support-oriented reading materials.  90% of learning the system was, as with your classroom kids, conducted verbally and (more importantly) kinesthetically.  Lots and lots of folks in the world do not learn by reading about something and then doing it; they learn by doing it, standing up, tools in hand, step by step.  RPG books completely and totally miss this very large demographic.<br/><br/>Which sounds like cutting the legs out from under RPGs.  If there are no RPG books, after all, what is there to sell, and how are the creators at least compensated, if not supported?  Well... we've already got podcasts going.  I don't suppose it's too far off that we'll see videocasts, too.  Who wants to be the first to create a video-based RPG "book"?  With the interactive features of a DVD, this can be a very useful and potent learning tool, and give lots more examples than flat text was ever capable of.<br/><br/>(And once you get over the production costs, manufacturing costs for DVDs are stupidly low!)                        </div>

                            Well, yes and no, JBR - these kids were also getting stuck playing computer games, where it's entirely hands-on, so I'm not sure that a podcast or a videocast would necessarily be better.  (It might!  I just think it's not a closed discussion.)  Learning from peers (and from me) was very effective, so maybe the question is how we can enable that kind of social transmission of play in the way that LARPers seem to be good at.<br/><br/>It even helped for me to come over to them and say, "Hey, you CAN solve this problem.  Can you think of something to try?"  That would give them the courage to try again - or, for some of them, to try for the first time. <br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Oh, here are a couple more comments:<br/><br/>- The only ones who had done any role-playing were doing it online, in forums or online games (Runescape was a big one).  It's only reinforced my opinion that we should be reaching out to the online-play community, particularly the fan-based games; these kids really enjoyed the tabletop play we did, but most of them had no idea it even existed.<br/><br/>- Many of them had parents who did not want them playing games with "magic" in them.  Pirates was okay, horror was okay, D&amp;D was emphatically not okay for about a quarter of the group.  This was not a "this game will teach my kids to be Satanist magicians" thing, but that the parents had genuine concerns about teaching their kids to treat religion disrespectfully/instrumentally.  Games with magic but without clerics might do much better with parental acceptance, and games with neither could reach the most kids of all.<br/><br/>This is REALLY important because these kids mostly can't drive (I have a couple of sixteen/seventeen year olds, but mostly they're younger) and they generally don't have friends near enough to walk or bike to.  Either we have to get parents behind play, to the point where they'll drive kids to do the activity, or else we have to think about how we can support them playing and learning online.<br/><br/>(Of course, online play for kids with trouble reading, and with no computer access at home?  Tough.)<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess - I am so sorry you didn't get to do the book club, Johnstone talks about his teaching methods, which are very encouraging and there are some of the spontenaity games which would probably help with the stagefright they are feeling. I'm sure that with the right kind of encouragement they can all imagine and they can all talk and that is all we really do.<br/><br/>As for games look at some of the pool variants. there are some that could be boiled down to two or three rules. Also, and I don't mean to be a memeber of the Vincent Baker fanclub, but dogs has some great "read aloud" rules when I learned to play we only had one copy so the GM read the rules to us. <br/><br/>You might try going around the room and having every one read a paragraph and talk about what the rule means. <br/><br/>I think you are right about wanting to be the coolest character, I think even us indie types do that we just have different assumptions about what the coolest character is. As for the wanting to be in the spotlight two things come to mind together first would be to make the scenes about 3 or four characters at once and after each scene let the class talk about what was happening and what could come next. The second is something Jason M. mentioned; at the start of the game he goes around the table and tells everyone else how he is going to try to make this a great game for that player. That sort of statement of expectation and encouragement could help people to be excited about each others characters. something we should all try to do more. <br/><br/>While I missed you in the Book club, This sounds like a wonderful thing you have. what went well in the class?                        </div>

                            Well, I can read perfectly well and I still really don't like reading the rules of an RPG.  It takes me so much longer to read and try and understand them than it does to just have someone teach me.  As a result, I own very few RPG books: D&amp;D 3.5 ('cause I got tired of not having a book to look up tables in), Sorcerer and the first two supplements (a gift), Nobilis (which I bought because I wanted to run it), and Polaris (also a gift, because I fell in love with the game).  Therefore, I totally sympathise with the kids who didn't want to or couldn't read the rules.  I can literally read them and it won't make any sense and you'll just have to explain them to me anyhow.  I think this is an important concept: we have to make games easier to actively teach, rather than handing a book around.  I have no idea how to do this, but wanted to express that it's not just kids who are adverse to spending a really long time reading the rules.<br/>

                            I guess addressing the needs of people with cognitive disabilities (ADHD, etc) is a sort of worst case scenario for pedagogy, much like addressing the needs of the blind is worst-case for web development.

                            Jess--<br/>
<br/>
Really cool stuff.  I have a few questions--how big is the group you were running through the pirate scenario (the one where they were frustrated with being out of spotlight for 3 minutes)?  I'm curious if some of this may be an artifact of having a very large (classroom-like) set of players in a social context that makes it seem like it should be more directly interpersonal.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think these kids would feel 'safe' if you served as the rules book?  I mean, that you basically just told them when to roll and what they needed to succeed?  I know most of us here have a terrible fear of the horrors of GM fiat, but is it possible that, with someone they trust (you) who is not playing out power issues, they might have more fun just focusing on the the narrative elements?  <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, how successful have they been when you do mini-demo session type things?  If you sit down with two or three students (who are good readers) and just play for a few minutes, does that help them get the rules?<br/>
<br/>
I'm unfortunately barely to un- familiar with the rules set you mentioned, but how math-y is it?  How math-y does it look when you first present the abbreviated version?  How intricate is the linguistic discourse (lots of tightly packed, logical-sequential structure?)?  How intricate does the language look?  I know when I looked at FUDGE for the first time, I wanted to give up, too.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I encountered working with the college aged versions of these kids is that they are much more competent than they *think* they are--they have just been roundly beaten about the head and shoulders with what they can't do so often that they shut down early to avoid the frustration.  It often helped them to be led into it from the back door--allowing them to 'discover' themselves in the middle of doing something they thought they couldn't do.  And I think that 'discover themselves' may be important--not be told that they have arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Ok...I've asked a lot more than I meant.  Let me just stop.                        </div>

<em> these kids were also getting stuck playing computer games, where it's entirely hands-on, so I'm not sure that a podcast or a videocast would necessarily be better.</em><br/><br/>Most computer games are still highly reliant on reading comprehension, <em>especially</em> their tutorials.  They usually follow the format of popping up a text box telling you to do something and then letting you do that thing and that thing only, then moving on.  There's little reintegration (although there's usually good iteration).<br/><br/>What I'm talking about is something like this: you download the video and hit play.  The faces of Clinton, Jason, and Remi fill the screen and identify themselves as the Durham 3, and they explain the kind of game you're about to play.  Then the scene shifts to the three of them around a table talking about the kind of game they're about to play.  Then they turn to the camera and tell you to hit pause and talk about the kind of game you're going to play.  Right?  I mean, this is pure Hook-Preview-Model-Do structure.  If you wanted to get fine-grained about it, you could split up the discussion into pieces ("Talk about characters you want to play." Push Pause. "Now talk about magic." Push Pause.  "Now talk about adventures.").<br/><br/>This stuff gets even easier to implement in DVD or Flash (it also gets more complex).  But imagine how cool it would be to invite your friends over, cue up the television, and follow instructions from such cool guys as Jason et al.                        </div>

                            First, <i>thank you,</i> Jess, for posting this. It confirms some suspicions I've had for the last couple of years - especially after some experience as a temp teacher: Many games are designed by grown-up smart kids, for other smart kids. What we think of as an easy-to-learn game or easy-to-read game text can be so hard for many kids as to be completely useless.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to ramble a bit about designing games for players who are young, inexperienced and/or not very interested in - or good at - reading.<br/>
<br/>
An easy-to-learn board game is a game that has a total time for set-up and rules instruction of <i>less than five minutes</i>. Ideally, you should be able to understand most of the rules just from looking at the components. This is what most games played by most people are like. Even chess and go can be explained in about this time.<br/>
<br/>
In role-playing games, where the "set-up" usually consists of character generation, it's okay to spend some more time on set-up - it's fun in itself. However, it's <i>not</i> okay, if you want to reach a broad audience, to assume that someone's going to sit down and read more than five or ten pages of rules.<br/>
<br/>
I've tried a few different role-playing games with different age groups at different schools. A quick summing up of those games, to show what I'm talking about:<br/>
<br/>
1. Three boys, aged about 15. One autist, two with learning disabilities. I let them choose from three pre-generated characters (magic-user, fighter, thief), each of which had three stats. Each stat had a picture of a D4, a D6 or a D10. High rolls were good. We used the blackboard for tactical maps during combat. The kids were very into it; the autist, who'd played D&amp;D before, helped teach the others how to play. The scenario was just a few scenes of shopkeeper interaction, theft &amp; combat. We only played once, for practical reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned:<br/>
- Keep rules <i>extremely</i> simple for a first game. Even with pictures of the dice, one of the kids sometimes had trouble picking the right die to roll.<br/>
- Let players try anything. Let them succeed at almost everything. Roll dice for suspension; keep the failure rate very low.<br/>
- Don't expect any heavy immersion, dramatic interest etc. Players with characters called "Fighter Dude" can still get very enthusiastic about the game.<br/>
<br/>
2. A classroom role-playing game for 11-year-olds. Everyone drew a labyrinth, put three treasures and three monsters in it, and GMed in turns, like so: "You see a corridor to your left, and one to your right. Where do you go? Right? Okay, you meet a skeleton!" Meeting a monster meant you lost one life. You had to get all three treasures to win. They had fun for the 45 minutes we had available.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned:<br/>
- Even games that seem inanely boring to adult, experienced RPG'ers can be great for beginners or young gamers. Compare playing professional poker or Magic: the Gathering to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.pagat.com/war/war.html" rel="nofollow">War</a>, which kids can play for hours (I did).<br/>
- Once again, don't get too caught up in drama, characterization, plot etc for a starting game. Keep it as simple as you can, and then make it even more simple. (In the "advanced" version of this game, I let them make traps instead of monsters. They had the exact same effect - lose one life - but different color).<br/>
- It's not hard to be a GM, as long as the rules for scenario design, conflict resolution etc are clear and simple. These children were rudimentary GMs, designing their own scenarios, after five minutes of explanation.<br/>
<br/>
3. An after-school game for two consecutive groups of six 8-year-olds; boys and girls in each group. They were little forest creatures, and could choose to be moon fairies (magical), troll fairies (strong) or sneaky fairies (stealthy). Hardly anybody went for strong - the girls mostly liked magical, the boys sneaky. I think we rolled some dice, but don't remember. They had special abilities, which I winged along the way.<br/>
<br/>
They had lots of fun. They laughed at the poor fairy who slipped on a rock and fell into a river; they were very scared at the big troll they met at the end, but were - of course - able to beat the troll (one group used mind control magic to lure him out of his cave into broad daylight, which turns trolls to stone).<br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned:<br/>
- Some of the kids didn't get into it at all. I'm not sure why; perhaps the setting was too fluffy, perhaps they were expecting a board and some rules, perhaps it was all a bit too vague and they weren't sure what to do.<br/>
- Make scenarios really, really, really simple to start with. This scenario was a simple investigative one (follow the tracks of the kidnapped head fairy), but there were some moments of: "What on earth do we do now?" Investigation should probably be used mostly as flavour, not as an intellectual exercise for the players.<br/>
- Kids this age love playing with adults. Getting lots of attention from a grown-up GM telling stories and pretending to be a troll is wonderful. It was easy for me to do, but the exact same game with a child GM might not have worked at all. There's a <i>big</i> difference in making games for an experienced GM with inexperienced players, and a group where nobody has any experience.<br/>
<br/>
So. I'm not sure how useful all this is, but these are all things I have in the back of my mind when trying to design games. It's important, to me, to remember that even if you don't like reading, and you don't like complex systems, you can still <i>love</i> role-playing. I'd love to see more simple, fun and easy-to-start role-playing games.                        </div>

                            My kids are absolutely GAGA for DnD.  My son keeps my old 3.5 books in his room and pores over them endlessly, when he hates reading anything else.  He loves to talk about the details he's read, and ask me what words he's encountered there mean.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm planning on running Weapons of the Gods (because the game rewards acting virtuously rather than just killing stuff) for them so I'll give an AP report after we try it out.                        </br></br></div>

<p>This was going to be a whisper, but...</p>
<p>Jess, Matthijs,</p>
<p>You propose some design constraints/concerns that sharply limit what sorts of games we can make that will remain accessible to the kids in question. Are you suggesting making designs to appeal specifically to these constraints, and setting the designer's tastes aside, or is it possible to make games that are accessible and fun for these kids, <em>and still</em> fun for those of us that Jess calls roleplaying success stories?</p>

                            Oh crap ... I just made a huge post and lost it.  DAMMIT.<br><br>The short version:<br><br>Jason, universal design?  Rock.  I need to print this and post it over my desk.<br><br>Isbo, I ran with small groups (4-6) while the rest of the class went to the arcade.  The system was super not-mathy (rolling dice to add or subtract from your score, or making pulls in Jenga; I fudged everything else).  They really did respond when I was telling them what to do and how to do it - not just for the role-playing but for the card/board games too.  Once they felt safe, they were willing to step away from GM fiat, but only when they were pretty sure of themselves, like when they were telling each other to make pulls in <i>Dread</i> every time they made a horror-movie cliche move.<br><br>Matthijs, I am <b>so</b> glad to hear about these other experiences.  They're already giving me ideas about how to change up this curriculum for next time I teach it.  I also think the points you extract from your experiences are spot-on, or at least fully consonant with my own experiences this week.  Even the older kids really wanted my attention, and really wanted to succeed, and couldn't care less about immersion - though they really, really want to know what happens next in their pirate story!<br><br>Shreyas, I think that whether or not we want to, we will have to design games that are specifically appealing to these constraints.  They do also have to be fun for us - but they don't have to be fun <i>in the same way</i>.  I can imagine designing a game that I wouldn't want to play, but that I would love to run for these kids.  I'm not an eleven-year-old, but that doesn't mean I can't play fruitfully on their terms.<br><br>--Jess                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<em>Are you suggesting making designs to appeal specifically to these constraints, and setting the designer's tastes aside, or is it possible to make games that are accessible and fun for these kids, and still fun for those of us that Jess calls roleplaying success stories?</em><br><br>Despite the fact that the question was not addressed to me... we're talking about designing the RPG equivalent of Blue's Clues here, right?  This is like Sesame Street: the Roleplaying Game.  Which is great, and I'm sure will be useful both for that endless mythical goal of recruiting new gamers and the more concrete and admirable goal of getting kids involved and invested in critical thinking, decision making, and perhaps further reading like Fred's son.  This is like, gateway drugs to "harder stuff" like D&amp;D3.5 and Algebra tests.  That's all awesome.<br><br>However, it's not the more complex, nuanced, or subtle fare that us "roleplaying success stories" enjoy.  Which is fine.  This is just market segmentation and product differentiation, and that's long overdue for RPGs.  In fact, the "upper crust" stuff will benefit in the long run by the "simple" stuff being there, both as a foundation and as a source of inspiration for later developments.<br><br>Now, is it possible to make a game that appeals to both semiliterate preteens with no gaming experience and little narrative comprehension as well as very literate, mostly college-educated gamers with arm-long gaming resumes and hours and hours of hard thinking on narrative structure?  Well, ask yourself this: have you seen a really engaging episode of the Teletubbies recently?<br><br>I'm not bagging on the Teletubbies or these simple games, and I'm not even casting the players we're talking about as inferior.  It's just a simple fact that these games are not intended for us as their audience, and that's <em>fine</em>.  The startling concept that we can make games for people <em>besides ourselves</em> is also long overdue in our thinking.  Designing for others, and designing for their needs and abilities, will only strengthen all of our designs in the long run.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<code>I'm not bagging on the Teletubbies or these simple games, and I'm not even casting the players we're talking about as inferior.</code><br><br>Actually, from the tone of this post, it sounds like you are.  Since you say that's not intentional, you just might want to be aware that you're coming across that way.  (I'm not trying to get into a fight with you; I'd want someone to point it out to me if I were sounding different from what I meant, too!)<br><br>I'm also not sure that this is exactly the equivalent of Blue's Clues.  In fact, this is somewhere that that big list of player skills would come in incredibly handy.  These kids may already have some of these skills in spades; they're really sophisticated when it comes to various kinds of media use, even if they're lacking literacy and/or confidence with things that seem unfamiliar.  They're also way more competent than they think they are, as someone mentioned above.  Maybe we shouldn't be thinking about "baby steps" of role-playing so much as games that cater to groups of people with different starting skills.<br><br>In sum, I agree that we can and should design games for people besides ourselves.  In my particular case, however - i.e. playing these games with kids on a regular basis - I'd prefer to have something that's also fun for me, even if in a different way.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>--Jess<br><br>(Edited because blargh, flaky internet.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

If we're seriously talking about making games for a different market besides ourselves, we need to be realistic about what we're talking about.  If we're talking about games for kids who "don't read very well" or "don't like reading" then we need to stop pussyfooting around and say "semiliterate" when we mean semiliterate.  If we keep masking everything in euphemisms and being polite about it, we run the risk of falling into the same trap that the US education machine fell into for so long -- blinding ourselves to the reality of our audience.<br/><br/>These kids aren't inferior, they're disadvantaged.  In fact, they're marginalized and ignored, and I can't think of a market that would produce more loyal participants or who could benefit more from the side-effects of playing games.  These are people that games <em>should</em> be written for.                        </div>

                            Okay - cool.  I figured that was what you meant, but honestly, these are tough topics so I'm glad for the clarification.  I'll add, though, that the kids I've been working with this week are semiliterate (or perfectly literate, but anti-print), but they're quite narratively savvy.  The two don't have to go together.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll add that the goal (at least for me) is <i>not</i> to get them to play just like us, but rather to play in ways that are meaningful to <i>them</i> and will hopefully sustain and help them.  It sounds like you're on a similar, and possibly the same, page.

                            Well, when playing <i>Dread</i>, they pretty clearly knew the conventions of the horror genre, and went ahead with things like "I go off into the bushes ... alone!!" and giggled when I had the monster jump out at them.  (I'm pretty sure they were pulling the GM.  Neat!)  They also had Ibsen's "gun on the mantlepiece" rule down pat.  For example, in the pirate game they knew that since a character mentioned a treasure map, the map would be coming back again in some significant way.  We also had a talk about action movies vs. action in games, and why the two were different, and they came up with some pretty cool stuff about what kinds of action are exciting in each.<br/><br/>Is this super-sophisticated?  Nope - but it's not Sesame Street level either, and I'm sure that if I'd had more time with them, I'd have gotten access to more narrative knowledge that they have.  Articulating this knowledge seems to be harder for them than acting on it.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            This is good stuff, but I have some concerns about the direction this is taking.<br/><br/>Making games for other people and not for yourself can end up being patronizing and all sorts of bad if you're not careful.  It's cool to make games that lots of people can enjoy together.  It's fun to make games with all sorts of design constraits.  It's great to write games for specific people or specific types of audiences.  But this quote sounds freaking scary and wrong to me:<br/><br/><code>I think that whether or not we want to, we will have to design games that are specifically appealing to these constraints.</code><br/><br/>Please, don't do stuff that you don't want to do out of guilt or a sense of social obligation.  That sounds like something destined for disaster.  Sure, your motivations can start there, but find a way to turn it into a project that you're in love with and can't wait to do.  Because, jeeze, look at what you just said.  You said we have an obligation to accept design constraints that we don't want and make games that we won't necessarily enjoy playing.<br/><br/>Ugh.<br/><br/>Just because we haven't made games with those constraints doesn't mean that we don't want to or wouldn't enjoy it.  It just means... we probably haven't though of it before, or just haven't gotten around to it.  I bet I could write a game with any set of contraints you could possibly name and still make it something you'd give your right kneecap in order to play.  Isn't that the prime lesson of Game Chef?                        </div>

If we want to design games for these kids, we DO have to design to these constraints, because they won't disappear just because of us wishing it.  These are real-world social and cultural factors that we have to live with.  The question is how we're going to feel, as designers, about the games we make, and the answer to that is, yes, love and pleasure.  I don't think that I have to enjoy the game the same way as the players do, but please - it's not like I need the extra work.  I'm doing this because I care.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess, I certainly wasn't trying to question your motivations.  But even the best motivations can end up in some ugly places, so I just wanted to throw that out there, for you and for the rest of us as well.  I'm an intercultural relations geek, so I worry about issues of projection, appropriation and the like.  Point made, I suppose.  Back to the game design scheming!                        </div>

                            Ok, I don't like the semiliterate talk because it obscures some important stuff.  We should be careful how we use terms like 'literacy.'  Most often, we treat it as a knowing-that sort of knowledge--I know that this word 'dog' refers to this animal over there, that 2+2 equals 4 and so on.  However, once we start thinking of it as a know-how things change.  In other words, being literate means that I know how to move from 2+2 to 4+4, or 8+12 without having to rotely memorize each step.  Its functional--both in the sense that it serves a function and also that it employs flexible 'functions' capable of dealing with multiple situations.<br/>
<br/>
That confusion is bad because it makes it easier for us to treat people with shortcomings in the know-that deparment as if they have shortcomings in the know-how department, that they are no better at applying ideas than, say, an 11-year-old with the same know-that knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
These kids have tons of the best sort of literacy (I know, Jess, you already mentioned this, I'm just talking about it a little louder)--they know how to manipulate the 'language' of popular culture in which they are immersed.  It's why they know how to tell a horror story.  They aren't passively observing it, they are absorbing the principles of the matter and developing the most functional elements of it.  What they haven't been given a chance to do is develop them into greater sophisitication through the application--which is what an rpg can give them!<br/>
<br/>
Which is just a longer way of saying: we have no reason to talk down to these people.  They aren't less smart, they just haven't applied their smarts in the same places we have. If we start doing 'Blues Clues' or 'Teletubbies' versions of rpg's, they'll roll their eyes and ignore it.  That should never be the model.  Give them something that challenges their strengths and they'll move towards it, even if it involves 'buffing' up on areas they are not strong.  <br/>
<br/>
Identify strengths and desires first and foremost, then use those as a way to address their shortcomings, use them to fuel that work, keep them invested in it when other difficulties have them down (and, yeah, I know, a heck of a lot harder in practice than on paper).  I don't think that is pussyfooting around to say--"you are literate in this way, I want to show you how to be literate in other ways."  It's pussyfooting (and demeaning) when we retreat and say 'well, they've got some literacy, let's pat'em on the back and give them a cookie.'     <br/>
<br/>
They'll be more challenging to engage because they want *story* not math and geometry-style logic. Most of us here are math-y and/or rules-y enough that a game can hold our attention based on its internal complexity--based on the system underpinning it.  For these kids, we need games that let them tell cool stories, without a 'cool system' being there to amuse us when it doesn't quite work.  They need good systems that let people tell good stories--exactly the sort of thing we are already working on.<br/>
<br/>
The challenge is to shift where the complexity occurs, not to strip it away.<br/>

                            Isbo, I agree.  And, as I tried to imply before, it doesn't just apply to these kids.  I have, frankly, no interest in examining the system for coolness.  It can be a neat system, but if I don't get to tell a neat story, the game gets dumped.  I don't game for the method, I game for the results (a story arc, not specific conflicts).  So really, if there are more folks like me and like these kids, there has to be a whole group of folks that we're not reaching.  And for reference, I'm very "literate" in the traditional sense, I just don't learn well from reading (I'm very auditory).<br/>

                            this whole "semiliterate" comment pisses me off for a couple of reasons. I think it is insulting to assume someone who doesn't think or talk like others is somehow "wrong". Secondly, this isn't the Forge. If you want to use a specific term that has a specific meaning you need to define that term when you use it. Andy isn't going to go around telling people they are using words incorrectly like Ron does, or did when I was hanging out there. My definition of stakes may be somewhat different than yours, and so on. No one is right, or wrong; that kind of thinking slaughters innovation in my opinion. No one is perfect, and no one always understands exactly what the other person is saying.<br/><br/>Be respectful, be understanding, and don't be a jackass.

<i>Can we just assume that nobody's talking down to anybody, that we know that people can think well even if they can't read well, and that we want to make games that are cool, fun and interesting for their intended audience?</i><br/><br/>I'm not (just) being nitpicky--Jess opened this thread with the aim of creating a curriculum--not just making games.  The use of terminology is pretty important in that situation.  And, as is my mantra, clearer terminology leads to fewer errors.  We think with words, the better the words, the better the thinking.  I'll also add that the literacies (plural) talk plugs directly into actual discussions going on in pedagogy discussions--something else that is good for a curriculum.  <br/><br/>What I have been talking about leads toward a broader question of how we would go about generating recommendations for this curriculum.  Namely, what are the strengths these students bring to the discussion?  What are the weaknesses?  In what ways can those be used?<br/><br/>Here are the concrete pedagogical-curriculum ideas that follow from what I was talking about.  (Progressively less concrete as I go):<br/><br/>General points: Especially in the early phases of the class, discussion should be the primary means of communication.  Any handout provided should be the subject of a discussion, with not only explanation occurring but 'framing' questions as to why you would have a handout, the sort of information it provides and so on.  Encourage them to approach the handout as something they can make suggestions about ("You know, I really need to know x, not y" or "this is too hard, I can't make sense of all of this at once").  This will help build the sort of critical skills they need to appreciate *design* concerns.<br/><br/>1. Begin the curriculum with simple story games--maybe even something as 'easy' as cooperative circle storytelling.  Teacher begins a story (verbally) and prompts students about where the story *could* go.  Discuss how they might go about developing the story together.  Let the students lead the discussion with a mind towards touching upon the following points:<br/><br/>--Taking turns (including time limits, sharing, etc.)<br/>--Developing the story coherently (including how a single player can change the direction and mood of the story without breaking its coherence).<br/><br/>Very important at this stage: Let the students develop their own explanations for what is going on here, don't make them parrot back words used in the curriculum (like coherence).<br/><br/>After some discussion, initiate a discussion about starting a story and how everyone could participate in it.  This will likely occur organically, from the students, but can be prompted.  Allow participants to formulate time limits and negotiate some ground rules for the story.  Establish whether or not there will be commentary allowed on the story as it is being told, but make clear that commentary will be necessary.  A good idea: video or audio recording of the storytelling session, esp. if commentary not allowed during.<br/><br/>(so, so far, two sessions)<br/><br/>2.  Move up to a discussion of why some games have more structure than the improv storytelling.  Allow them to freely bring in examples from boardgames, childhood games, what have you.  Important just to establish why you might want more guidance in the game.  Illustrate examples from the storytelling session that might illustrate why rules would be useful.  For example, conflicts between storytellers that might have been avoided with other rules.  Introduce more complicated storytelling games (perhaps "how to host a murder mystery" style--lots of good pseudo-rpg stuff here!).  Possible discussion points (again, ideal if they produce ideas on their own in response to conversation):<br/><br/>--Taking on the role of a single character in a broader story as a means of making it easier to share a story?<br/>--Question of a central person whose job it is to keep things 'on track'?<br/><br/>3.  Probably good to touch on wargames.  Can be pretty general, brief mention of origin in actual strategic training of officers--importance of 'near' accuracy to reality, and so on.  Showcase some simple boardgames of this genre--allow players to discuss whether or not they seem to meet the 'goals' of a wargame.  (is Risk really a 'good' wargame in this sense?).  Mathematics should probably begin to show up in very limited form (simple tasks, dice rolling, looking at charts)--perhaps small, small excerpt from broader framework.<br/><br/>4.  Question of video games and realism--highlight how they can be hyper realistic, how they have realism 'coded' whereas tabletop required players to 'know' the code.  <br/><br/>5.  Start playing some basic rpg--gosh, the old Marvel Superheroes rpg seems ideal--it's amazingly key word driven with a very simple, color coded chart.  The genre has become very popular, so it is likely something they will at least recognize.  I don't know how easy it would be to get hold of...                        </div>

                            A lot (all?) of the old FASERIP Marvel Super Heros stuff can be downloaded in PDF form from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.marvelrpg.net/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Which is cool in itself, really.                        </div>

                            Thanks warren!  That is awesome--especially from a curriculum perspective since that would cut down on the cost of implementing it.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that might be important for a 'intro to game design' sort of curriculum:<br/>
<br/>
Peer review (and more) should be hardwired into the course.  The goal is to foster a critical eye towards the production of games and the best way to do that is to make the students play the key role in the evaluation of the games.  Don't call it peer review if you don't have to--just establish the cooperative ethic that peer review aims to instill.  I think this sort of curriculum is well-positioned to do this.  Unlike so many other places in school, I suspect kids feel entitled to evaluating games.  Just channel that evaluation, encourage productive criticism.  the prompt method might work very well.  Like:<br/>
<br/>
Kid 1: "Man, I hate this game."<br/>
Kid 2: "Me too, it totally sucks."<br/>
Kid 3: "I dunno, I kinda liked it."<br/>
Instructor: "Kid 1, Kid 2, what didn't you like about it?"  "Kid 3, what did you like about it?"<br/>
Kid 1: "dunno, it just made no sense."<br/>
Kid 2: "I don't want to read all that stuff..."<br/>
Kid 3: "Well, I like the idea that you could play..."<br/>
Instructor: "Kid 1, was it too word-y?  Or was there something else that didn't make sense?"<br/>
Kid 1: "I guess the words were alright, but it had all those charts and I just couldn't figure out what they were for..."<br/>
Kid 3: "Yeah, I just ignored those, but I thought this part was great..."<br/>
Instructor: "Ok, so maybe this game has some good ideas but could be explained better.  Let's talk about those cool parts a little before we take a look at the charts..."                        </div>

                            For the record, you guys rock.  My computer has gone 'splodey but as soon as I have a working alternate solution (besides stealing time on my boy's machine) I'll try to collate some of this stuff, post about my last day of teaching, and throw it all back at you guys to chew on some more.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Something at the back of my head: a section on 'wargames' seems could be broadened out to a discussion of 'practical' simulation in general...a good 'lead-in' discussion to things like video games, also contains possibly fruitful zone for further discussion of why rules might be important.<br/>
<br/>
Example: roleplay for doctor training--you want rules so that actors (who may know relatively little about system presentation or the behavior of people with certain sorts of cognitive impairment) don't provide bad simulation, don't train bad habits.<br/>
<br/>
While you wouldn't want to toss out the mathematical elements that would come up in wargame sim, you could have parallel examples that don't depend upon mathematical cognition.  Ideally, the parallel example can be used to facilitate an understanding of the mathematical one (and vice versa, for those students more math inclined).                        </div>
