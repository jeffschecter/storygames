What defines a gamer (to me) is the willingness to spend time to get to the fun, be it 3 hour character creation, 2 weeks of studying the rule book to kind of understand it, and regular interuptions of play while the rules are consulted when something is unclear. Eventually we might not put up with that, but certainly to start with, when the available systems were AD&amp;D, Rifts and GURPS, it's something we did, even if it wasn't happily, 'cause if we didn't, we wouldn't be gamers. Things like schedules and times throw a wrench into that, pushing people who were normally willing to spend the time towards games that only require the time investment of playing.<br/><br/>Now non-gamers won't do that. If character creation takes long and gets tedious, they'll just quit saying it's not fun. If they have to read chapters of rules (or even pages), they'll get fed up with it. At that barrier to entry, they'll just give up. They're perfectly happy to play if they don't have to worry about the complicated stuff, but they won't put the time investment in.<br/><br/>Not terribly useful hypothesis by itself, but I've lately been running games for people who mostly just play computer games, and computer games let you start playing right away, and learn as you go (as the computer knows the rules), so I've been taking a system I really like (ORE), and stripping it down to the point that there's really no sense in using ORE. Also, the aspect that seems perfectly natural to me (sacrifice a die to make an extra attack) isn't intuitive at all to them. It seems like the finely crafted system of ORE just goes to waste. <br/><br/>So, do you agree with this? That what sets a gamer apart is the willingness to slog through the unfun to get to the fun?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289898/#Comment_289898" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T11:26:25+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 11:26AM by Peter_Aronson.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or maybe they're the sorts of people to find that stuff fun?

I used to spend 3 hours making a character. I used to enjoy reading books cover to cover. I don't anymore. The difference is I used to be a kid, and schedules and life didn't get in the way of playing, so while I was making a character, or reading the book I was anticipating playing. Now when I make a character or read a book I don't anticipate playing, because it's damn hard to schedule a gaming session. For me it comes down to the fact that this is leading somewhere. If I think I'll play a character, making it is great fun. If I think I'll play a game, reading it is great fun, but it's the anticipation that makes it fun, not the act itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289922/#Comment_289922" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T11:49:08+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think age or schedules really has anything to do with it -- I'm 52, married, with a full time job and a high maintenance kid.

I get fed up having to read pages and pages of rules to get to the good stuff -- so I don't.  The only reason I bother with GURPS nowadays is because I imprinted on it as a teen, and have a good working knowledge of it; likewise, I don't bother with D&amp;D4 because it's 400 pages of things that can be minmaxed, and I can get the same payoff as playing D&amp;D4 with a lot lower investment.<br/><br/>I think there are two principal reasons that gamers put up with the tedium while non-gamers don't:  first, they don't realize it's unnecessary, and second, they understand what the payoff is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290102/#Comment_290102" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T17:08:53+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  5:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Computer gamers slog through installing, patching, DRM hassles, customer service forums, unofficial fan fixes, and shady Russian warez sites to  get *their* games working.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290118/#Comment_290118" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T17:43:49+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  5:43PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think all people wade through garbage in order to get what they want.<br/><br/>&lt;--- End of Thread ---&gt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290125/#Comment_290125" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T18:03:09+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  6:03PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some computer games <i>do</i> have long, complicated character generation, but also give you the option to say, "yeah, you know what, I don't care, just pick for me!"

There are definitely people who will try building different Burning Wheel or Champions or D&amp;D3.5 or D&amp;D4 characters for the fun of it, rather than for a specific upcoming game.  In much the same way, deck-building for collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering is often considered a fun activity in itself, rather than something that has to be gotten through in order to get to the fun of play.  <br/><br/>While there are often templates or pregens offered for quick start, I think viewing fiddly character creation as "un-fun" grunt work is seriously missing the point.  While there are some players who enjoy, say, using only premade M:tG decks - I suspect that most enjoy putting together decks and consider that strategy step as part of the fun of the game.  I think the same goes for Champions players and many others.  These games are designed for and appreciated by those who enjoy fiddling with system stuff.  <br/><br/>Computer games are quite different from tabletop RPGs, because you can play at any time.  Tabletop RPGs and collectible card games are often considered part of the "hobby games" market - because they have a component that you can do while not actively playing.  (I suspect that for some games, online discussion fills this aspect of the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290217/#Comment_290217" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T21:13:48+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:13PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>So, do you agree with this?

In fact, some gamers love things like character creation and optimization, while others loathe it and only play games that allow them to get into the action immediately. The key is knowing what you like, and what the people around you like, such that you can find a way to engage everybody.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D 4th Edition Dungeon Masters Guide has a whole section near the beginning that details a variety of different types of gamers: what they like, how to give them what the need, and how to avoid certain problems that might crop up around them. I'd recommend giving it a read-through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290235/#Comment_290235" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T22:16:32+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I agree with that argument, as I'm someone who used to enjoy (or used to think I enjoyed) reading through tomes and working on fiddly character generation, but if I look at it realistically it's because I didn't have a choice. It was AD&amp;D, and then GURPS was a big change (which on the grand scale of things is more like AD&amp;D than not), Rifts or EarthDawn might have been an option, but they all had that requirement.<br/><br/>Now that I've played games like Zorcerer of Zo where I can buy it off the shelf (after having perused it months prior, and having read up on it online) and start playing after about half an hour to get everyone else up to speed, or Reign which lets me just roll a character up, and tweak if I like, without having to really bother with too much reading, I don't see the point in going back to it. Long and involved character generation and thick tomes were something of a necessity if you were a gamer in the 90s - it's not like you'd have much luck finding games that didn't have those qualities on the shelves. <br/><br/>So sure, some people might be enjoying that, but I only enjoyed it in the absence of something better, so I'm not convinced someone else isn't just enjoying it for the same reason, or enjoys it because of nostalgia. And let's do a little poll here - who among you who says they enjoy the fiddly character creation actually wants to learn how to do it with Rifts (if you haven't already played it)? How about HERO FRED? What about FantasyCraft?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290237/#Comment_290237" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T22:21:30+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:21PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoy some fiddly character creation but not others, so that's not a very good test.

When I ran AD&amp;D 2e, I didn't invest a lot of time reading every line of the rulebook. I read some, skimmed some, made up some stuff, and pulled out my bookmarked rulebook (with the bookmarks labeling areas of the rules I knew I didn't know very well).<br/><br/>I guess I was a good GM, because my players always put up with it and helped me out with a lot of the rules. I have such a short attention span that it took me two sittings to read S/Lay w/ Me in detail.<br/><br/>On the other hand, once I got the physical version of Apocalypse World I read it all in two sittings, lists, charts, and play examples (which I usually gloss over at first) included).<br/><br/>Similarly I must have read Hell for Leather ten times before sitting down to play, so I guess it depends on the game! If I'm reading advice on how to play, designer stuff, neat ways to use rules, and stuff about how totally awesome the game is, I'll play along. The dense text found in AD&amp;D and Shadowrun, though, I hate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290259/#Comment_290259" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T00:22:02+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 12:22AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess this means that despite 20 years of playing and running RPGs, I would never have qualified as a gamer. Interesting.<br/><br/>I think it's difficult to simply slap a label on folks. Those that self-identify as "gamers" do so because they feel that they share values with others that identify as "gamers". While there's wriggle room, on the whole the group helps to define what the term represents. It may or may not adopt some/all of the definitions that might be applied to the group by those that are outside it. Much of the definition tends to be implicit (approved behaviours, popular topics/opinions, etc) rather than explicit (if you don't D&amp;D youre not a real gamer).<br/><br/>I for example don't self-identify as a gamer. Primarily because I feel I'm out of step with the majority of "gamers" and their values. I don't self-identify as some sort of "story-gamer" either. Again, I don't feel I'm especially in line with what appears to be group values.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that someone won't slap a label on me. Folks are always labelling others. Just that I don't voluntarily label myself in that fashion.<br/><br/>Also, a while back on rpg.net there was a post about "15 minutes of fun in 4 hours", I think specifically in relation to D&amp;D. Most of the people that hang at rpg.net consider themselves gamers, but there was an awful lot of angst and whatnot about that whole topic.<br/><br/>So I'm going to disagree and say that while you might use that particular yardstick for yourself and how you evaluate others, not many others will agree with that measurement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290331/#Comment_290331" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T08:01:27+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  8:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I enjoy some fiddly character creation but not others, so that's not a very good test.

What made it enjoyable to learn for me was that I have enjoyed d20 fantasy a great deal and new mathematical approaches to it open up new creative avenues for it.  I mean, I wouldn't hand my set theory textbook from college to someone and expect them to find it engagingly written, but to someone who has an interest in it, they would devour it, since the ideas are presented clearly and in an order/method that helps you learn it.<br/><br/>Remember, to me, games are toolboxes for play, if they aren't themselves enjoyable to read, that's fine with me, so long as they convey their ideas effectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
