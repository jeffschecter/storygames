So the next evening when I was stuck in Seattle Airport for eight hours waiting for a plane, I started going through the lists of "adjectives" and "jobs" that I had pulled from the list of hundreds of Film Noirs in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-City-Film-Spencer-Selby/dp/0786404787/ref=sr_1_2/102-0047789-2916171?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183359455&amp;sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">Dark City</a> by Spencer Selby.  I added in some "actions" from <a href="http://www.storybase.net/" rel="nofollow">Storybase.net</a>, and created a quick "Noir Plot Generator" that uses only a deck of cards to come up with a plot and interaction between two characters.  <br/><br/>I still have a lot of work to do to make this work within the constraints of a relationship map with perhaps 6-10 characters on it.  But I had a lot of fun just flipping cards and writing down what I got.  Since every adjective doesn't work with every job, I made the two cards interchangeable so you could pick what the coolest combination was.  I also have content lists for first names and locations and am working on lists of traits, dark pasts and last names .  This is fun!!<br/><br/><b>30 Second Noir Plots:</b><br/><br/><i>Wounded cab driver is suspicious of insane Hollywood star.<br/>Ambitious insurance salesman is isolated from misguided cop.<br/>Tyrannical playwright journeys to see beautiful newspaper reporter.<br/>Powerful twin brother has a revelation about small-town cab driver.<br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79077/#Comment_79077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T07:56:25+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  7:56AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I'd be interested in seeing this when you're done with it.<br/><br/>And is it just me, or is this turning into the Year of the Noir?

They're stuff we <i>want</i> to draw connections between.<br/><br/>An R-Map is a series of touchstones focused on characters.<br/><br/>That SandTray/World Technique thing I showed you is a bunch of physical objects acting as touchstones.<br/><br/>Matthijs buddies' outcome resolution cards are a deck of touchstones.<br/><br/>What I'm thinking is that normally, we try to categorize are touchstones into one kind of grouping.

Because this morning over breakfast, I pulled out a deck of cards to show my non-gamer fiancee the "30 Second Noir Plot".  She humors me a lot with these sort of things.<br/><br/>We drew five cards and came up with "an embittered cop named Norman Collins who hangs out at the theatre".  Rachel looked quizzical.  "A theatre?"  <br/><br/>And then the magic happened.  Her eyes lit up and she said, "and you know where Norman hangs out?  The room with the star on it.  With flowers in his hand."<br/><br/>Yeah!  So we know that we have some sort of an actress for the second character.  So I drew just four cards this time, for her adjective, first/last name and location.<br/><br/>"Her name is Joan Wood and she's a tough actress.  When she's not at the theatre, she hangs out at...ooh...a flophouse room.  Being a star doesn't pay too well these days, I guess."<br/><br/>Rachel thought for a moment and said, "Yeah, she's a tough cookie, and he's just desperate enough to want to save her faded glory."<br/><br/>And there we had two characters, a conflict and an idea for a first scene in under two minutes.   Sweet!<br/><br/>This is exactly the type of creative improv/riffing I was hoping for from this card-based mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elberon" title="Elberon"><img alt="Elberon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elberon">Elberon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263158/#Comment_263158" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-20T18:50:59+00:00" title="March 20, 2010  6:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you heard of NanDeck - a program which allows you to create your own cards, no need to have a list anymore (once you're happy with the list of course) - Hmm I don't want this to come across as spamming but I posted this comment to the wrong thread earlier on (idiot that I am)<br/>\n<br/>\nChris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
