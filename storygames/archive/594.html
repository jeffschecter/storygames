                    The game as it stands is going to be divided into two parts. The first is creating the mythology and the situation, the second is relating playing characters bumping into the mythology in the situation. <br/><br/>The first part of the game uses DevP's Casting a Net (Castanet?) mechanic to push the twelve gods that Ben gave us into some sort of formation. The 24 D4s that Andy threw in will be used for the dice in the nets.  They could be used to set up the situation described in JBR's little story or they could be used to set up conflicts among the Gods as Linnaeus suggested. Similarly they can be used to develope cool artifacts for the GM (or as I like to think of him the $2Bill or $2Tanya Or $2Kuma) to use in the game. <br/><br/>Also at this time Players will be asked to define aspects of the Gods Like the colors and Directions Talysman suggested. these will acrue from session to session so that there are more and more ways for the players to attach their characters to the gods through these associations.<br/><br/>At the end of the Castanet portion of the game. We should end up knowing what the situation the $2Bill is going to have and whatever things the players want to play with. <br/><br/>The players then develop characters they want to throw into the situation. Like Thunder_God said they all have a "Cancer" that has set them apart from humanity. The players need to determine what this Cancer is and how it has opened their eyes to what is going on. The cancer is also going to be represented by a number reflecting the severity of the Cancer as the number gets higher they will be less capable of performing some actions but more cap[able of performing others. I think this will be a roll under for actions and roll over for understanding but that may change.  The characters will also have to take one of the Male gods as a father and one of the Female gods as a mother the character will get bonuses for acting within the desires of their parent gods and for associating their actions to the list of things that were attached to the gods in the opening portion of the game. <br/><br/>The point of the game is for the characters to thwart the plans that the "thirteenth" has caused. The guiding image of the "Mayhem" is the image of the Giant Robot  attacking London that Bryan made. <br/><br/>On the whole the thing is feeling a little Dr. Whoish to me and it may be that the game is not a Macho Narr sort of game but I am looking for a simple way of creating the mythology that the players can work off of. The $2Bills job is to take the parts the players want to play with and make those elements challenging to the players. I am reading with some interest the discussion about GM advancement and looking for ways to tie that in. <br/><br/>How is this going so far? What parts don't make any sense yet? what can I explain better? Does anyone want to throw something else into the pot?<br/><br/>Edited for missed Period                </div>

                            Trollbabe style sliders divided between acting and knowing sounds nicely Lovcraftian, to me at least....<br/>

The more you know the harder it is for you to know what to do, what risk to take?                        </div>
