I have some questions about his games, especially one in particular.  Unfortunately, all the normal avenues to contact him are blocked for me by the GTWoC.  If you are friends with him on G+ or in real life or your a visitor to his blog, would you mind asking him to send me a message here.  Or I can give you my email and you could pass it on to him.  Thanks in advance for your help.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
