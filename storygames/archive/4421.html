It's difficult to run scenes that are fulfilling for every player with more than about 4 characters in the scene, unless the characters are taking sides against each other. And the more characters in a scene, the longer the scenes tend to last. <br/><br/>In My Life with Master, with two characters, we can get through 20 scenes in 4 hours, but most scenes only tend to have one character involved. In Dogs in the Vineyard, where pretty much everyone is in every scene, with 6 players we can managed about 8-10 scenes in four hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99852/#Comment_99852" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T17:00:46+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  5:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our Contenders, we had four players and typically, 16 scenes.

It will also depend on the play group.  Lukes group in BE gets interstitials done in a minute where my group takes 15 minutes to act out an interstitial scene.<br/><br/>Maybe the question would better be asked with a little context as to what your looking for in a scene, as shreyas suggests.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101107/#Comment_101107" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T13:03:04+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  1:03PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FLFS runs about 3-4 hours and has 10-15 scenes.<br/>SoL Battle Mode runs about 2-3 hours and has 3-5 levels (which are sort of scenish).<br/><br/>As has been pointed out, there are games with quick scenes and games with big long ropey scenes.

I think I play relatively sluggishly. But it wouldn't surprise me to have only 3 or 4 scenes in a 4 hour game. I've had more, certainly, but I think the average is less. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'm focusing less on how many scenes there are, than those sorts of things that Shreyas is talking about. This relates to the problem of "Scene Resolution" from the game Story Engine. That game says that there's one conflict per scene that gets resolved. But then it goes on to say that sometimes there are two scenes in one scene (or more). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it's really doing is admitting that scenes are not the units of drama that need to be resolved (dramatically or mechanically). It's correct in that it's indicating that a scene with nothing that moves forward at all is a wasted scene in terms of drama (one can argue the use of exposition scenes, however). But it's not correct to say that there's a one-to-one relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I even fear that I don't get out 3 cool events per PC in one session of play. On a good day, certainly, but if I'm not being a motivated GM, and the players are not being particularly proactive either, you might have sessions with less than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that, in drama terms, this is still way higher a rate of dramatic progress than in the stories created by otherwise Gamism play, where you can have entire sessions where there are no dramatic movements at all - the fun in these game sessions is supposed to be in the tactical challenges. So I find even this somewhat glacial rate to be relatively satisfying. I do know that it's far too slow for some "story-gamers." <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn IRC play we run concurrent scenes in different windows. This means that the amount of scenes that we get through depends a lot on how many different groups the PCs are divided into. There's a diminishing return (I can only GM so fast in IRC), but generally if the PCs are on their own mostly, that's going to mean more scenes. I'd say that one or two per PC-unit, is typical. So you'll have two PCs in one scene, and then one of them will migrate to another ongoing scene, while the other goes into a new scene. That sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment in the IRC game, all of the PCs are on a mission, so it's looking a lot like party play, and we're getting only one or two scenes per session. But, again, since there are lots of PCs involved in each scene, there are a relatively high number of cool events per scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that a higher number of scenes tends to produce a higher number of cool events, on average. But there's a diminishing return, again. Three times as many scenes might produce only two times as many events. So one should probably push for more scenes, but realize that this alone is not an efficient way of getting more cool events. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo date, the only really effective way to ensure a higher rate of cool events is to have them prepped out well. I haven't been doing much prep at all lately, which probably explains the somewhat lower rate as we all try to find those cool events spontaneously in play <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101226/#Comment_101226" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T07:03:41+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  7:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4470" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> has stuff in it that pulls the curtain back in a more thorough way on part of why I asked this question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101248/#Comment_101248" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T08:40:51+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  8:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one thought I've had on scenes is using them as a way to smooth "scene time." For example, if each player has one scene that was designed for them this can help ensure everyone got their "moment to shine." This implies the number of scenes should be close to evenly divisible by the number of players. So if there are 4 people around the table, 4 scenes would work, 8 scenes would work, 4 scenes +1 "backup scene" in case someone's scene turns out to be dull would be ok too. but 6 or 7 scenes wouldn't be as good. The next consideration along this lines is that it's better to have 2 scenes per person rather than 1 in case one of a person's scenes falls flat. This helps ensure everyone has at least one good scene focused on what they are interested in per session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101285/#Comment_101285" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T10:49:16+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 10:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hadn't ever thought of it.

But, assuming you want more story-like arcs, how is numbers of scenes going to affect that? <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider that the movie Rope, by Alfred Hitchcock, is not only one scene long, but in fact is crafted to look as though it was all done in one shot (they pass behind furniture and stuff with the camera and cut there to actually give the actors a break).

Also as a result of this thread--or perhaps another--I included interstitial scene options.<br/><br/>As to why have a specific number of scenes? Well, each scene has something specific and particular to do. A good way to map the dramaturgical structure onto a game session was to have X scenes, each of which was a given point on the story structure which had specific needs to drive toward. Also, I don't want to have a system of limitless opposition, where the amount of resources the GM has are only limited by her whim. The other option is an economy which controls this, but economies are hard and I wasn't really up for it in my first design, so I decided to go with the enumeration of scenes, which nicely handles this requirement.<br/><br/>I'd be happy to do all of this without enumerated scenes that are purposeful, but I'm not sure how. This is the best solution I and my alpha testers and co-talker-abouters could think up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101301/#Comment_101301" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T11:41:09+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 11:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS: as for the Rope analogy, you can still have scenes without there being a physical cutting-away.
