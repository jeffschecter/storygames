What are the most important themes of Earthdawn and more importantly what are the most important RULE points to bring to D&amp;D4?<br/><br/><br/>So...<br/>To KEEP Earthdawn true to it's original premise,  what do you feel are the:<br/><br/>TOP 5 Themes/Story Elements/Background Points  to translate to D&amp;D4?<br/><br/>TOP 5 Rule/Statistic Elements or Points to translate to D&amp;D4?<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm familiar with Earthdawn myself, but I'd like aid in discussing these points with my player group - some who are not familiar.  I'd like your help to make those bullet points.<br/>Please be as detailed in your ideas as you can.<br/><br/>Thanks!!<br/><br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156349/#Comment_156349" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-13T17:39:44+00:00" title="July 13, 2008  5:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The things that leap out at me as I sit here exhausted and frustrated after a long day of shopping for cars and realizing I'm too fucking poor to get any car that I like, are: <br/><br/>1) Corruption and Art. The thing that made Earthdawn more than just better explained D&amp;D was the Horrors, the possibility of corruption anywhere, and art being the only way to prove your humanity. The possibility to be corrupted, and the temptation to use powers that will give horrors a chance to corrupt you should be a part of the game. Hell, I'd even say it should be a bigger part of the game -- as the folks with the biggest trade off choices were spellcasters, I'd love to see a system for the 4th ed port where  everyone can make the choice to use powers that might get you horror touched. Say the ability to use a daily power more than once a day, but doing so opens you up to horrors. <br/><br/>2) The Thread of History's  Name. Everyone and everything has a True Name, and those names give power and vulnerability both. Knowing those names, and their history, gives you power over and also understanding of your world and the others in it. (And ties in with the possibilities for corruption above.)  Research, the tying of threads, and the quest for names and histories are all very, very important to Earthdawn and are both an endless source of plot, color, and the very important sense of fallen and lost history that makes the world unique. Rituals that use thread weaving, magical items that level up with you as you discover more about their past, and similar issues should port over. <br/><br/>3) Flying Shit is Cool. Flying fucking ships fighting flying fucking castles and flying fucking dragons is fucking flying fun! That even fairly low level Earthdawn characters may well have access or ownership over flying ships, the ability to jump out of them and fall for a mile safely, swinging from air currents like fucking trapeze artists, and that one of the PC races has wings and flies all on their own is the awesome. Flying shit and rules for flying PCs are already part of D&amp;D, so this should be easy to port over, but some thought should probably be given to how more flight and flight at earlier levels changes encounters. (You know what happens to the orc scorchers without missile weapons when they fight the windling wizard, right?) <br/><br/>4) Everyone has a story, and everyone has a reason. The Blood Wood is evil and fucked up. Of course, they have reasons for being as they are and if you actually find out what they're about they might not be so evil. Thera is evil and fucked up. Unless, of course, you're Theran, and then there are real and good reasons for being as you are. The Legion of Doom is evil and fucked up, except that sometimes they are the only thing that stands between the horrors and the utter destruction of a whole village -- amputate the arm to save the body, as it were. Pretty much every major group in the world works like that, with a lot of folks looking like big evil monoliths of badness from the outside, and seeming more sad, lost, or just opposed politically when you actually find out what is going on. Plus, the whole world is basically a bunch of trauma survivors, so extremes of reaction are pretty common and understandable. <br/><br/>5) We got a thousand points of light, for the homeless man, we've got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand. The world is fucked, brutal, and ugly. The centers of civilization are centers of political power that often fuck each other more than they help anyone. The horrors still lurk and suck souls like slurpies. The ruins of empires greater than any now known are everywhere, and the lost lives, lore, and wonder of a hundred generations are scattered like broken toys across the twisted land. And in the middle of all of this the one constant source of hope, heroism, and light is the PCs... as long as they don't get corrupted themselves and end up tearing down everything they loved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor" title="vae_editor"><img alt="vae_editor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor">vae_editor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156351/#Comment_156351" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-13T18:06:24+00:00" title="July 13, 2008  6:06PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It did have amazing art. <br/><br/>I loved the decayed world setting, that's what hooked me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156388/#Comment_156388" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T06:47:21+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  6:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't say I will buy it... actually, I will not buy it. but strangely I think that D&amp;D4 will likely be a better match for Earthdawn then 3rd Ed would have been. In 4th Ed everyone basically has magic... the "power source" or what ever it is called now. with that type of design and the power structure that they use now I think it is a good fit (can't believe I am saying that). <br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly Earthdawn is a bit more "dark" than the traditional D&amp;D base settings, and 4th's is absolutely no exception. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a complete aside (but I just thought of it):<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would love to have a Fireborn game where you flip between Shadowrun and Earthdawn settings as Dragons. that would be the hottest thing ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156391/#Comment_156391" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T07:10:01+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  7:10AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Earthdawn was a much more Cthulhu-esque world, closer, I feel, to some of the original AD&amp;D 1st Edition materials. If a Horror marked you, it could reach out and torment you regardless of where you were. There also was a real feeling of horror when you discovered some of the ruins, places where people had barricaded themselves in and for centuries the creatures outside slowly erroded the physical and magical barriers. I don't have the books in front of me, but I remember one place where you could hear the Horrors scratching away the runes on the other side of the great sealed doors, and as the barriers failed people started to go mad from Horror-sent nightmares. And this was all before the first ugly even managed to come inside and eat someone. Nasty.<br/><br/>Capturing some of those elements I think would be tricky for any game system, much less 4E D&amp;D, which seems much more geared toward high-powered tactical fights.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
