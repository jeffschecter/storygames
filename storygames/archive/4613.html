It's my passion, really. Hell, I've got the title of it tattooed on my forearm.  It's seen a lot of changes over the years, but I think I'm finally getting the game to a place where it does everything that I want it to.  <br/><br/>I've recently been working on the last two rules additions to the game before I open it up to a beta playtest (as Joshua BishopRoby defines it).  One mechanic, a trust and betrayal thing that the game has been needing for a while and I just figured out a couple of weeks back, seems to be working okay.  The other thing is where I put my head against the wall.  <br/><br/>The game is meant to emulate caper and heist movies.  It uses a ton of the terminology from the genre as the source for its mechanics.  Characters have vices, motives, knacks.  They get advantages from taking the time to get the right tools for the job, talking to the right informants, what have you.  There's a drama point system that brings in all of the crazy movie things that can happen, like a concealed flack vest or a character being able to "flashback" to earlier in the scene and narrate an advantage for himself that he didn't know he would need.  <br/><br/>Now I'm starting to think of the concept of the Scene.  And then I went and read <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=7915311#post7915311" rel="nofollow">this</a> (thanks to Dan Solis for the link), and that definition, it just sings.  It fits what I see as the needs of the game.  And I don't know what to do about that.  <br/><br/>For a while now I've been running CE with <b>very hard</b> scene framing, sometimes to the point where I'll say things at the top of a scene like "This is the scene where you stake out the warehouse.  What are you looking for?"  It keeps game play tight, which is what a game like this needs, and it serves the greater good of emulating the heist movie genre well.  And I'm a big fan of the idea that if I'm doing a thing at the gaming table regularly, then it should damn well be a rule in the book.   But for some reason I've always been reticent to make the scene a part of the resolution system.   <br/><br/>There's a section of the book dedicated to scene framing, defining exactly what a scene is, how to approach creating one, how to make each scene both important and fast, all of that good stuff, but I've relegated that section to the the GM Advice part of the book.  And here I am, starting to get the feeling that scenes are much more important than that; that the Scene <b>needs</b> to become a rule.  Scenes are important to the game.  They are a part of the game currency, especially with the added trust and betrayal rules.  The end of a scene is when characters get to heal from damaging effects.  Also, as the game is intended to be run at a very punchy pace, having hard and fast scene rules in the system would seem to add to game velocity.  <br/><br/>The problem I'm running into is purely conceptual: I've always seen my game as simulationist and I'm afraid that adding in hard and fast scene framing rules would mess that up.  Yes, I'm messing with the fringes of the definition here more than a bit, but the game attempts to emulate the very specific tropes and stylistic elements of a film genre and inject those things into game play through the rules.  Would introducing this concept of the Scene take my game off of the rails completely?  And if so, is that really all that bad a thing?  And, to broaden the question up a bit, does the introduction of rules concerning scene framing and pacing necessarily shift a game over into the realm of narrativist?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104354/#Comment_104354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T11:46:21+00:00" title="October 23, 2007 11:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2007 11:46AM by Judd.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael,<br/><br/>I'd worry less about which GNS-ist it is and more about what makes for the game that you want to play.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm wrong about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104357/#Comment_104357" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T11:52:43+00:00" title="October 23, 2007 11:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael, it sounds as though your scene framing is being used to support the Sim idea.

What I was really looking for with this post was just a little bit of back-up from some people to let me know whether I was on the right path or not.  And from Judd's first (completely non-bullshit) response on, that's what I've gotten.  I just needed someone to say "Hey, Michael, you're on the right road.  Trust your gut."<br/><br/>When I first made CE, it was way back in the glory days of GNS, well before the Big Model and all of that stuff.  Now, don't get me wrong, I dig the hell out of what Ron and everyone set up.  Hell, I was pretty deeply involved in some of those early discussions.  My feelings have always been that GNS or the big model are great for keeping your mind straight when it comes to end product, but they tend to lose their power when your deep down into the guts and minutia of game design.  Inevitably though, I got a little bit... well, frightened when I realized that including those scene rules are what the game needs, even if those sorts of things aren't a part of your standard Sim game.  Then again, CE doesn't have rules for weapon damage, so I'm not really looking to make your archetypal Sim game anyways.  <br/><br/>Strangely enough, the first game I thought of when I started conceptualizing how I'd want to handle scenes in CE was TBZ.  I'm not looking to state strictly how many acts or scenes go into a session or series, but I definitely want the concept of scenes to be an opaque, real, used-at-table thing.  I want the Director saying stuff like "Okay, new scene.  This is the scene where you try and get those guns you've been wanting.  You're all sitting around the diner, waiting for Jimmy to show up and sell you those guns.  He comes walking in and looks the worst for wear.  What do you do?"<br/><br/>Judd, your response wasn't bullshit at all.  It's nice to have someone say "Hey, don't worry about that stuff, make the game you want".  And in response to your question, I really don't foresee any of the Sim stuff in the game getting messed up by the scene-framing elements.  I think that the scene stuff might actually highlight the other aspects of the game.  At least, that's how it works in my head, a place in which I am most always right.  I posted this stuff mainly because it seemed like a big, and final, step in the development of the game and I just wanted to know that my head was screwed in right before I jumped off that ledge.  <br/><br/>As for my tattoo, I got it done for a couple of different reasons.  One of them is because I am extremely proud of my little game and I knew that I would eventually finish it, so I got the name tattooed on me to kick myself in the pants a little.  That and because it looks totally fucking evil.  And I mean that in the best way possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104394/#Comment_104394" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T14:13:30+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  2:13PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>You have the words "Criminal Element" tatooed on your forearm?

Also, I'm so happy with the work that my artist did that I just love showing the damned thing off.  <br/><br/>So, while I don't have any pictures of me without my tattoo, I've definitely got some of me with.  I now declare that... <b>It.  Is.  On.</b> <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.fullmotorproductions.com/files/portrait_miami_vice_style.jpg"/><br/><br/>See how I've got a blackjack hand on there as well?  That's because CE uses Blackjack as the play mechanic.  <br/><br/>And on my other arm?  A tattoo of the Serenity logo.  Because I'm the biggest nerd in the universe, but I like to look bad-ass while doing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104490/#Comment_104490" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T00:41:42+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 12:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is <i>excellent<i>.</i></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104494/#Comment_104494" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T02:03:44+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  2:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That needs to go on the back of the book.

But the game is back in high gear and I'm going to be opening it to beta playtest in three short weeks.  Glad to hear that you're so into it, man.  Agon, if no one has told you this, is the shit.<br/><br/>And to Graham, there is actually another picture involving the tattoo that's going on the back of the book.  In that one though, I'm holding a gun.  <br/><br/>Also, I know that this is only thread-jacking more, but can I say "holy shit, I'm actually publishing my game"?  'cause, guys, that is fucking crazy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
