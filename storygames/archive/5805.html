We've just wrapped up our last two games (Savage Conan and Savage Deadlands) and I've been rather caught out when they all agreed to give Burning Wheel a go (specifically, Blossoms are Falling). <br/><br/>We've never played BW before, but they have high expectations of the games we play and so all eyes are on me to show them how great BW is. Problem is, I've only ever ran anything Burning when I ran a single phase of BE, and have only ever played a one-shot of BW. We've dabbled in indie games (PTA went down ok, Six Bullets bombed, Agon was thoroughly enjoyed and Dogs got an ambivalent response) and they're willing to give most things a go. Half the party really dig crunch and getting to grips with mechanics, a couple prefer character and story over anything mechanical, but all enjoy getting into the story and giving the game a good ride. Oh, and only me and one of the other players has read the book.<br/><br/>My current plans are twofold:<br/><br/>*clan and character burner run as the first session, having made sure everyone has had some setting info in advance.<br/>*print all the various combat and duel of wits maneuvers on little cards, so that not everyone has to know the rules to grasp what's going on.<br/><br/>So help me Story Games! You're my only hope! I need hints and tips and plenty of advice to make the first session (hell, the whole campaign) as kick ass as I possibly can.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129970/#Comment_129970" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:30:52+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanical summary cards rock. especially in something crunchy and different.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, here's my two koku...<br/>\n<br/>\nEncourage them to make a tight knit group with beliefs and instincts that relate directly to each other. If you have a player that always needs to be the outsider, don't fret, make sure the others are really tight and he's REALLY an outsider, but be sure there's a concrete reason this outsider has to be with these people, once you start playing forge some relationships between the outsider and some of the main group's npcs that make it even harder for him to leave.<br/>\nFamily is an excellent way for the group to fit together, clan is important, and can make bonds that even hatred can't sever. Need some real-world examples? ask someone from a big midwesern family how much they can't stand some of them, then ask why they go back for reunions. they'll shrug and say "it's family."<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't start off slow, reluctance to get into any kind of mechanical fracas will kill the momentum, get them into a conflict right off the bat, if you guys are shaky about the way things work then make sure it's a conflict that won't have longstanding fallout that everyone will regret for the whole game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... Failure Is Good! It means that there are deeper repercussions that the characters now have to deal with. The more baroque and complicated the closer you are to total meltdown, and total meltdown rocks! The entire heian era was a valley and spike of meltdowns where societal rules got burned up bad. it's why there were no major wars for a few hundred years after. So go full throttle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129973/#Comment_129973" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:42:54+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew,<br/><br/>The BW forums are really<b> the</b> place to go for these kinds of questions.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129979/#Comment_129979" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:57:27+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:57PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2008 12:57PM by Ogremarco.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://burningwheel.org/forum/index.php                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129990/#Comment_129990" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T13:49:03+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  1:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, I second the suggestion to spend some time in the BW forums.  I've found many of the threads to be informative and fascinating.<br/><br/>But my big piece of advice is to start slowly.  This is something I did *not* do when I ran my first game, and it lead to a lot of difficulties at the table.  Don't go crazy with 'Range and Cover' your first full session.  Do some tests, have them Circles up some folks, maybe a Duel of Wits.  If you concentrate only on the first half of the main book for awhile it will go a lot easier, especially since you are using an alternate setting book with it's own rules.<br/><br/>Spend the first half session running the group through The Sword.  It will show everyone the basic mechanics and give them incentive to push it knowing that their character's ass isn't on the line.  If you are worried about the fantasy vs. Japan setting...just file off the serial numbers and replace them with Japanese names when no one is looking!  <br/><br/>One great thing I learned from watching Luke demo is to print out DoW and combat sheets and put them in clear plastic sheets with grease pencils.<br/><br/>Oh, and everything Ogremarco said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130013/#Comment_130013" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T14:49:22+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  2:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really spend some time in that first session fine tuning the characters' beliefs to aim at the situation and each other.

It's too LARP-like (more than The Gift), and encouraged a number of player behaviors we didn't want to associate with the game by default.<br/><br/>Inheritance, our Viking funeral scenario, does a lot of the things Poisonous Ambition did, but better (IMHO). If we follow BWHQ SOP, it will get posted to the Wiki sometime this summer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131838/#Comment_131838" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T22:19:53+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 10:19PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I found this little bit of AP that I posted about our game of <i>The Gift</i> last year.

So we'd play the Gift, maybe wind up with the Taira killing the Minamoto Chieftain, then leap to the clan burner to set up our own game, with the events of the Gift in the background.

A gaffe of etiquette leading to a strained social interaction and possibly a battle would very much be in the spirit of Blossoms.  The difficulty in any such scenario of course is making sure you've created reasonably balanced characters for each side.  I like running the Sword and the Gift first because they've been battle tested.  On the other hand, it really doesn't matter if your intro scenario ends in crushing victory for one side so long as everyone has fun and gets the gist of the rules.  I know it would be too ambitious for me just for time constraints but I think it could work.<br/><br/>If you do go that route, keep one thing in mind.  In the world of Blossoms, the person who made such a huge blunder as forgetting the gift would likely be expected to undergo ritual suicide and expunge the shame.  So either you'll need that person to be an NPC who dies off screen and leaves the PCs in the soup or you'll need a way around that still keeps the PC in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
