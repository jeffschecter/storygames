The FAQ was helpful, but there are a few things I was wondering in addition.  I'm prepared to accept that a lot of this is probably covered in the book and if I had more time to sit down with it and re-read parts I'm sure I'd get this, but hopefully someone here can help me out!<br/><br/>1) Advantage Dice - These are only usable once?  Or do they apply to all rolls until neutralised?  For example, if the heroes ambush an enemy, they get an advantage dice going into the battle.  Who gets this dice, is it the player who rolled?  Do they keep hold of this die and add it to any single roll during that battle?  Or does it need to be spent straight away (on the first positioning roll)?<br/><br/>My reading/understanding is that the player who rolls for the ambush gets the die if he succeeds and can use the die once only and add it to the pool of any one roll he makes during the contest.  Is that right?<br/><br/>2) Divine Favour - Players start the game with 7 of 14 boxes available.  They gain one point for completing a quest, and can spend them pretty fast if they want.  The rules also say that a hero gets all his divine favour restored when he makes a sacrifice.  Is that back up to 14, or 7?  I'm assuming 14?  Doesn't that make the one for completing a quest a bit weak, or am I reading this wrong?<br/><br/>3) Divine Favour again - All named NPCs get a pool of DF.  I assume they use them the same way as the players, right?<br/><br/>4) Weapons - Players and opponents choose their currently held weapons (left and right hands) in the breaks between exchanges.  So if the heroes get into a fight with a group of soldiers, the Antagonist decides what the soldiers have in their right/left hands before the first exchange, right?  Assuming the soldiers have a sword, a shield and a bow.  So if the starting distance looks close, then as Antagonist, I'm going to start them off with Sword/shield, and if it's far, I'll start with a Bow.<br/><br/>Can the players try for an ambush to catch the soldiers with the "wrong" weapons in their hands?<br/><br/>5) Monsters - Monsters can only be harmed by magic weapons.  A hero can burn Divine Favour to make their weapon's magical and able to hurt a monster for a battle, but that's very costly.  I get the impression that getting a magic weapon to hurt/kill a monster would be a secondary objective of a quest, something like: Get the Magic Sword of McGuffin, then...  Kill the Kraken.<br/><br/>Is that right?  Am I supposed to provide such weapons as a part of the quest (makes a really neat secondary objective)?  If so, should I provide enough so that all the players have one, or should I just provide one and let the players argue over it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76562/#Comment_76562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T03:02:50+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  3:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>1) You should probably check the one.seven forum at the Forge, this topic seems to come up a lot...</p>\n<p>2) "Gain one point for completing a quest" means, when you complete a quest, your <em>maximum</em> Divine Favor increases.

Named NPCs use Divine Favor in the same way as the PCs. Use it wisely (I usually save it for opening dice)<br/><br/>4) This is tough. A player can make a Cunning roll to assure THEIR position at the start of a battle (as opposed to using the standard 'starting position' chart). I'd have a player make a cunning roll that's resisted by a general Mook Roll (Sport+Name), and for each success let the player force two mooks to have a specific weapon. If the player is beaten, the mooks get to choose the player's weapon. It seems like being able to choose your initial position accordingly would be more useful, but if you were playing Mr. (or Ms.) Cunning, you could make both rolls to start close to an opponent with the WRONG weapon, which would be cool.<br/><br/>5) I believe you are correct. This is how I play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76586/#Comment_76586" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T07:17:58+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  7:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!<br/><br/>Cheers guys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
