The overt goal of all the players being to build up over several episodes of set-up to a climactic faceoff. I've run this sort of series before, but usually by feel and guesswork leading to mixed results. If there's already an existing game offering this precise set-up, I'm unaware of it.<br/><br/>Then, while looking over the old story-game stalwart <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041012080435/www.randomordercreations.com/thepool.html" rel="nofollow">The Pool</a>, I sketched out a possible means of modifying that system to enforce the build-up I'm looking for. Tell me if this sounds good.<br/><br/>In play, there are four kinds of scenes, which for now I'll call Low, Middle, High and Summit (again, the the rationale is that the characters are involved in a drama of growing tension, so there's a hierarchy). <br/><br/>Low scenes are minimaly risky, about finding information, making initial contacts or formulating a plan.<br/><br/>Middle Scenes are notablely risky, making first strikes or winning a foothold against the series nemesis.<br/><br/>High Scenes are very risky, major blows against the villain's resources or taking out inportant lackies.<br/><br/>Summit Scenes are the climax, win or lose for the whole series where the character makes their final play against the foe.<br/><br/>Now, here's the tricky part. As per the Pool, characters have traits and dice, but rather than a single die pool, they have four, one for each type of scene. Players begin play with dice in the Low Pool, and none (zero, nada, zip) in the other three. A player can only use dice for a scene from a Pool of that type (and maybe higher pools as well, I'm unsure). <br/><br/>When a player successfully "wins" a scene, their reward is adding a die to the Pool of the next level of scene (ie, by winning a Low Scene, they get to add a die to their Middle Pool).<br/><br/>Hopefully, this compels the players to follow the progression in order to build up strength for the Summit Scene. The player get to decide what kind of scene they're entering into, Low, Middle, et cetra, presumably letting their own favor of their stronger pool reinforce the progression of scenes.<br/><br/>To keep players from diving into high level scenes unprepared without consequence, they always lose dice for a failed roll, even if they gambled none from a pool. If they have no dice in the appropriate pool, they lose dice from the next one down. If they've got no dice to loose in any pools, they accumulate negative dice in their low pool (its never so bad it can't get worse). Also, I'm contemplating various structures for dealing with Summit scenes to avoid anti-climax. Such as, if at any point more Summit scenes fail than win, the villain wins, and requiring at least a number of climax scenes equal to the number of players.<br/><br/>So that's it so far. My most likely failing is some quirk of probability that crashes the whole structure. Math-minded insights would be appreciated. <br/><br/>Reviewing, I note this is only a couple steps away from being GM-less, since the progression enforces pacing, there's a mechanically mandated end point, and as per the Pool the players already handle the bulk of narration. All that would be needed is a system for parceling out authority for narrating failure. Wasn't a goal when I started this, but now I'm tempted to follow that up.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165763/#Comment_165763" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T12:31:40+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 12:31PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2008 12:37PM by Grant Davis.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some results from using 4 riskless dice (GM dice plus Traits), a rather generous amount from what I can tell:<br/><br/><code><br/><br/>"GM Dice<br/>plus Traits"\t4\t\tAuto Loss\t0\t\t<br/><br/>dice\t1 die\tLose\tWin\tLoss\tGain\tNet<br/>0\t83%\t48%\t52%\t0.000\t 0.518 \t 0.52 <br/>1\t83%\t40%\t60%\t0.402\t 0.598 \t 0.20 <br/>2\t83%\t33%\t67%\t0.670\t 0.665 \t (0.00)<br/>3\t83%\t28%\t72%\t0.837\t 0.721 \t (0.12)<br/>4\t83%\t23%\t77%\t0.930\t 0.767 \t (0.16)<br/>5\t83%\t19%\t81%\t0.969\t 0.806 \t (0.16)<br/>6\t83%\t16%\t84%\t0.969\t 0.838 \t (0.13)<br/>7\t83%\t13%\t87%\t0.942\t 0.865 \t (0.08)<br/>8\t83%\t11%\t89%\t0.897\t 0.888 \t (0.01)<br/>9\t83%\t9%\t91%\t0.841\t 0.907 \t 0.07 <br/><br/></code>\n<p>There are dimininishing returns until 5 dice, when it becomes increasing returns. <br/><br/>At 0 dice risked, you net 0.52 dice.
