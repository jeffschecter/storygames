Lots of fun playing it, and it's a great "gateway game" for my group, which generally get antsy about anything less tactical than D&amp;D, although they seemed to enjoy the game a lot. Anyways, I was thinking today that the rules could work surprisingly well as a game about rockstars rather than marines. FA becomes skill, NFA becomes style, kills become sales (of concert tickets or albums), and planets become some major event like a tour or an album. The ranges become the difference between gimmicks and art. Similarly, weapons become musical styles, ranks become degrees of fame (eventually moving the band members into the recording industry), damage becomes stress, medals become awards, etc. <br/>Anyways, just a thought. I'm not sure if I'll ever actually run it, but it would be a fun idea, maybe for a one shot or something.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Haakon" title="Haakon"><img alt="Haakon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Haakon">Haakon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176022/#Comment_176022" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T07:32:00+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  7:32AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2008 7:32AM by Haakon.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool. The lower ranks could be something like this: Trooper=Roadie(every Roadie wants to be a rock star, just ask Lemmy), Corporal=Bandmember, Seargeant=Club Star etc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
