We had played a different Game/Setting/Character every session and they were a little tired of the novelty. We chose Space 1889 because we all wanted to do a stempunk thing and enough of us were familiar with it to make it easy to start. We all pretty much hated the system so I said I would throw something together but we will probably modify it over the course of the year. Here is both what we played and what happened.  <br/><br/>We had had very good luck with PsiRun so I started with that. Liking the way the player can control what is happening appealed to us and the Zero prep time aspect means that we can all just show up. with out the overriding direction of the premise. I wanted the characters to have a little more freedom of direction so we tried to apply the Keys from TSoY and reward that sort of play. I also wanted the other players involved in each others scenes. Originally I had envisioned a polaris like system with all of the players at the table contributing parts to the story with an elaborat dice passing scheme but we fell back to all of the other players contributing as GM when they are not in the scene in a slightly Universalis like fashion.<br/><br/>I wound up with 5 potential rolls for each scene:<br/><br/>Goal - What the character is trying to do.1-3 fail, 4-6 succeed<br/>Harm - Any potential harm to life, limb, ego, reputation or anything else. 1 permanent harm 2 successes to remove, 2 permanent harm 1 success to remove, 3 harm for rest of session, 4 hamed next scene, 5-6 no harm. <br/>Delay - This roll allowed the character to move on to the next scene or if failed be stuck again in the same location or scene. 1 two scene delay, 2-3 one scene delay, 4-6 no delay.<br/>GM - This roll allowed for a number of tokens to be put into a pot which can be drawn by other characters to add to your storyline. 1-2 two points, 3-4 one point, 5-6 no points<br/>Key - If a characters featured Key is called into play this dice can be used to succeed or fail. If a success is rolled the success can be traded for a failure and a hero point taken for later. A hero point can be used for an extra die later. 1-2 fail, 3-6 succeed.<br/><br/>Those were the rules we stared with.<br/><br/>Pete played a German woman who had disguised herself as a man and fought for the South in the Civil War then as a mercenary with the Belgians on Mars She deserts and goes back to living as a woman which she is not good at. Her Name is Miss Anne Thrope<br/><br/>Phil's character is an owner operator of a small airship that was decommissioned because it is no longer Etherworthy. He is a smuggler and reprobate trying to go legit. At the start of the game his ship has been impounded. His Name is Kemper von Bethoven<br/><br/>My character was a Neanderthal who was found frozen in a cave in Scotland and thawed out. He is an inventor who, while on an archaeological expedition on Mars was taken captive by a Belgian freeholder and put on a work crew digging a canal to drain a swamp. His name is Bertie.<br/> <br/>I started out by picking the lock on my manacles to escape my imprisonment; then the martians who were in the work crew with me wanted to go as well, so I struggled to release them and when I did they all fled ahead of me as the door to the cabin we were held in started to open. I fought the belgians and escaped into the swamp.<br/> <br/>Anne, still dressed as a man, deserted and headed off to town to buy a dress and wig, along the way she encountered a patrol who questioned her. The leader a Lt. Poirot didn't buy her story but let her go. The first investment of one of the GM points makes him a recurring character. In town she tries to hire a canal boat but it is waiting for that same Lt. Poriot. She must wait two days in town.<br/> <br/>Phil spent most of the session trying to get enough money to bribe the burocrat to release his ship. he got a missionary family signed aboard but the money was not good enough. he keeps trying but his cover as a legitimate business man slipps and someone notices and Kemper is approached to smuggle a State Criminal out of the area.<br/> <br/>Her new costume having cost too much money Anne tries to run out on her hotel bill and is caught out as a man. She then pretends to be a man in disguise spying for the govenment. This delays her one day while she pretends to be a man again and meet her contact. As a result she misses the boat. <br/> <br/>It turns out that the Criminal Kemper is ferrying is a big time anarchist with a load of bomb making materials. Kemper lies to the missionaries that the Anarchist is a medical researcher with contagous materials and that they should stay in their cabins. While approaching the city they are going to set down in Kemper hears explosions below. It turns out that the anarchist is throwing bombs out the porthole at a collum of soldiers that is on it's way to meet Lt. Poirot.<br/> <br/>Bertie fights a monster in the swamp and emerges right into the collum of soldiers being bombed.<br/> <br/>That's where we ended up. First some things we found out about the game. <br/><br/>The delay worked fine. It was a hold over from when I wanted to use the system as a caper game and it was the thing that we all thought was going to fail, but it proved fairly useful. The best was when Anne was slated to be on the canal barge with Lt Poirot and in the next scene Pete wound up with a delay so he missed the barge. <br/><br/>The thing we called Keys were more like character premises rather than Keys in the TSoY sense. We need to change the term and it is something that will need to be fleshed out. They wound up working like thematic batteries in FLFS. as away for the characters to power up through failure. It also worked as a good flag for what to push on the character with.<br/><br/>The mechanic for instilling NPCs through the GM points was fun. It took Phil's fine paying customer and failed roll on keeping his past a secret turned through Peter's point of investment into a bomb throwing anarchist with a name.  <br/><br/>Peter was thinking after the game that he didn't like the Key Roll. He found a lot of dissonance in the rolls. He didn't like that the key didn't play into successes. Afterward we talked about combining the two rolls into one. Without your key you would roll 1-3 fail, 4-5 success but with the non scene characters throwing the but in, 6 success free and clear. With your key you would get 1-3 fail and 4-6 succeed. and anytime you could choose to fail and take the hero point.<br/> <br/>This would make having the keys very useful, but very hard to get. I would probably start each character off with 2 or 3 points at the start of the session. I'm not sure that any of us would be willing to take 5 failures to get another Key.<br/> <br/>Phil thought that useing the key should get you a bonus with the reroll. If you are playing a scene without using your key you can only add the bonus dice before you roll. If you are playing a scene with your key, you can roll  the hero point bought die at after your roll.<br/><br/>I am also thinking about how to make a combat scene work out. I think that by using the delay untill you can score enoug successes to kill the other character.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267926/#Comment_267926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T10:28:27+00:00" title="April 20, 2010 10:28AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting.  This brings up one of the things I've been thinking about with TPS, which is how to model something like skill checks.  BRS doesn't really have those; it just uses fiction and trait add/remove/change to model that sort of thing, but I think it would be cool to have something more like a skill check available for when people want to use it.  It seems like both your system and TPS have things in common with different aspects of RPGs like D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267927/#Comment_267927" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T10:34:05+00:00" title="April 20, 2010 10:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted a way for the players to have a sense of accomplishing something in each of their scenes, or barring that the knowledge that putting off the accomplishment led to something.
