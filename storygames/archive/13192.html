In case there are some Irish/UK gamers out there, here's the low-down:<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Giant Dice-Off</span></b> <i>(Fri 7-10pm, Sat x 4: 10-11am, 2-3, 6-7 &amp; 10-11pm)</i><br/>Do you like Huge F***ing Dice? Do you like deathmatches? Then sign up for free Giant Dice-Off! You'll face off against your first opponent on Saturday morning/afternoon, stacking the enormous dice like a game of Jenga. So, put on your goddam game face and let the foam-dice-mayhem commence!<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hell for Leather: Deathmatch</span></b> <i>(Sun 3-6pm)</i><br/>You\u2019re about to die and it\u2019s gonna be gruesome! Tell the story of 12 contestants on the world's bloodiest game show as they race across the globe. Kill your mates as you clash in a hyperviolent showdown of gore, fire and chainsaws! Two tables, 12 players, one survivor. Winner takes all. FREE EVENT!<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hell for Leather: Inception</span></b><i> (Mon 11-2pm)</i><br/>Inception. You've seen the film, now play the game. SPOILER: Mr. Agabe is about to make the most important decision of his life. Will he cast his vote to support the incumbent political party, or will he vote for freedom at the risk of civil war? Some people believe that this decision is too big for just one man. That's why it's your job to get inside his dream and convince him there's only one option. FREE EVENT!<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hell for Leather Demo</span></b> <i>(Fri night and throughout the weekend)</i><br/>On Friday night and all through Saturday, I'll be demonstrating the GM-less storytelling rules of Cobweb Game's d\xe9but game, "Hell for Leather," the darkly comic game of pursuit and savage violence. If you've got 5 minutes, pull up a seat, chat about games design, and roll some dice. If you'd prefer to book a longer demo for a few of your friends at once, I have two slots available for 45 minute demos and he'd be happy to pencil you in. It's all free, so visit the Hell for Leather stall to find out more.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Live Art Inking</span></b> <i>(Sat 2-4pm)</i><br/>Senior artist for Frontier (<i>Lost Winds, Kinectimals, The Outsider, Elite</i>) / freelance concept artist for Cobweb Games (<i>Hell for Leather, Way of the Agent</i>), Jason Hickey will be inking up a selection of gory prints live at the Hell for Leather stall. Pop by to watch him work and chat about his experiences in games design.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
