She knows in what side of the location she will place their monsters and where will the players be. But the exact locations are often left at whim of players or GM, even when based on the scene framing or player feedback. This small ruling is meant to give players who go first an opportunity to also get a small positioning advantage and also, give the other players something to do while they think of their tactical approach.<br/><br/>So basically, players roll initiative, then the one who rolled the last places their miniature (or miniatures if she's the DM). Next goes whoever rolled the next higher value, trying to get the best from the previous players positioning. <br/><br/>On a surprise round whoever got surprised places their minis first and then the other side places theirs in reverse initiative order.<br/><br/>Was this already somewhere in the DM manual or in this forum and I'm just remembering it now? Does it look like it could generate some toxic play? Has anybody played using something like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463394/#Comment_463394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T20:57:03+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  8:57PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a great idea.<br/><br/>I use this with the "initiative" roll in D&amp;D.

The player who is going last, in addition to having to wait for everyone else to place their mini and take their turn is likely making a poor decision on where to stand, as the other side is going to be able to pick more optimal positions compared to them.  Going last sucks enough as it is, and imo, placing your mini first is an additional drawback, not a perk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463417/#Comment_463417" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T15:53:25+00:00" title="May 17, 2017  3:53PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good to know Paul, thanks! I'd like to try this on our next 5e session, along with some combat training for the players. Some are new and some have years playing rpgs, but they are all still not using too much of the tactical depth the game offers, that it's where it really shines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463419/#Comment_463419" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T16:06:34+00:00" title="May 17, 2017  4:06PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Novan, perhaps it may have something to do with the size of the location, I think. I mean, on 20x20 ft rooms with nothing but a couple of places for cover, your viewpoint is solid true: the last two players will take the covers and there will be no safe space left for the ones that go first, which won't be the melee fighters, if they are STR based.<br/><br/>I'm mostly using more open terrain with no boundaries and lots of cover, where angle and visibility matters more as cover becomes useless if the opponent places their mini on an angle that gives her clear visibility.<br/><br/>Perhaps I could propose a fix to the ruling to match both scenarios: What if the player with the higher initiative can decide if he places first or waits until others have placed their minis? Sounds like it makes sense both in and out of the fiction for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV" title="NovanIV"><img alt="NovanIV" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV">NovanIV</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463420/#Comment_463420" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T16:29:36+00:00" title="May 17, 2017  4:29PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that.<br/><br/>Picking last is better if there will still be a number of viable spaces to choose from, since you have more information when you place.<br/><br/>Picking first is better if you are going to run out of good choices fairly quickly and are just going to be taking what's left by the end.<br/><br/>Who you think deserves that advantage depends on if you are looking for an additional reward for rolling high, or compensation for going last.  Both are reasonable.<br/><br/>Now, I would still go with the guy with highest init picking first in either case.  Partly because of the free move that I mentioned previously that placing and then taking the turn gives him, but also because it just makes sense to me that the guy acting purely on instinct has less of an awareness of the battlefield, but I could see an argument for either way depending on what you personally thing the init roll represents.<br/><br/>I would likely give the option to choose if they place first or second to the side that successfully pulled off an ambush though, regardless of post-surprise round init rolls.<br/><br/><br/>Of course, another option entirely to resolve starting positions is old-school marching orders, with the GM placing the enemies based off whatever the game's particular agenda is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463422/#Comment_463422" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T17:20:13+00:00" title="May 17, 2017  5:20PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            marching order makes sense when the party is, well, marching. I'll keep that of course. This one is more for particular cases. Also, the "first move" whole deal makes sense, but it would be kind of limited at our table, since the deployment area for minis for each side will be limited to 1/4 of the whole area, or less on open areas. This sorta limits its advantage, which I'm willing to let go in exchange of being a bit more close to the fiction as narrated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463426/#Comment_463426" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T19:10:04+00:00" title="May 17, 2017  7:10PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I like that choice - it makes sense and is interesting.<br/><br/>Do you want to place first, or wait and see?
