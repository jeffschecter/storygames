Nothing really insightful to add about the game that others haven't already mentioned. This was a three-player game and took about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Happy birthday, Robot!</b><br/><br/>"Congratulations, you get to become a real boy!"<br/><br/>The professor cheerfully continues: "One catch: A boy must take your place."<br/><br/>But it's Bobby's birthday and he openly wishes real hard.<br/><br/>Professor hears Bobby's wish to become a real robot.<br/><br/>Professor convinces Bobby's parents to unground him and allow the procedure, but it might be temporary.<br/><br/>Bobby and Robot sit in the Switcheroo Machine, but it sputters loudly.<br/><br/>Robot waits anxiously while Professor kicks it back to life.<br/><br/>Bobby becomes Robot, Robot becomes Bobby, and Professor says with joy: "Hello, Nobel Prize!"<br/><br/>Bobby likes flying around town with his new rocket legs.<br/><br/>Robot likes eating pizza and playing with Bobby's little brother.<br/><br/>Bobby misses pizza. Robot misses flying. They switch back.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>So that's Happy Birthday, Robot! I'm looking forward to playing with a younger demographic at some point. I'm curious how they'd handle the cooperative gameplay and the lack of character ownership.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
