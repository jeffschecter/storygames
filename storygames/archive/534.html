                    So I've recently started listening to Paul Tevis' <a href="http://www.havegameswilltravel.net/" rel="nofollow"><b>"Have Games, Will Travel" </b></a> on my commute.  And his talk with Paul Czege made me think about interest in creative constraints.  So two recent threads have brought up some people's problems with the constraints of a well-defined setting -- Shreyas' <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=527&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">"Setting Without The Crap"</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=482&amp;page=1#Item_26" rel="nofollow">ross comment</a> in the D20 thread.  <br/><br/>So Paul's suggestion was that he liked creative constraint.  By forcing people to work within the limitations of MLWM, it brought out their creativity.  In general, I enjoy a well-defined setting (often modern or historical Earth) and I feel like it is a positive creative constraint to me.  I can't just make up a new city or somesuch -- rather, I strive to work within what is known.  <br/><br/>So it occurs to me that perhaps people prefer different <i>types</i> of creative constraint.  So maybe for someone, it's good to lock down the sequence of scenes, but not good to lock down the setting.  Maybe someone likes predefined situation, but dislikes pregenerated characters.   <br/><br/>Going first, I think I'm pretty broad about my constraints, but I prefer them to be highly concrete.  Maybe there's something more here, but I'm not sure.  Taking a recently-mentioned example, I had a tough time coming up with stories in Baron Munchausen, because I felt like it wasn't constrained enough.                </div>

                            I like narrative constraints, of which examples are few.  I like being told "Okay, now your character must establish a relationship which pains them" and figuring out who or what to link my character to to accomplish that while still forwarding the story or ethic that I'm trying to produce with my character.  This is why I lovelovelove Dogs fallout.<br/><br/>I don't like tactical constraints <em>in roleplaying</em>.  Being told, "Oh, you can't do X because of Y, so you'll have to figure out a different way" annoys the fuck out of me.  Now, I'm all about that exact same thing elsewhere, in tactical wargames or boardgames, where I'm invested in the tactical situation, not the narrative situation.  In RPGs, being told that my proposal cannot work because of the "reality" of the fiction kind of misses the point, in my mind -- if I'm not changing the reality of the fiction in play, I'm not playing.<br/><br/>That said, a sort of 'middle road' where I might propose something and another player calls me on it and engages some sort of resolution system, especially one using the flags that we set up in building the game -- that's all good.  "I'm not sure your hard-line patriot can let a traitor go like that.  Roll your Duty to the Crown stat."  That's good stuff.                        </div>

                            I've always loved relatively well-defined settings that are still fantastic enough to build a bridge toward modern sensabilities. I'm not all that happy with that "fact-sheet" style of presentation that Shreyas brought up, however. <br/>
<br/>
Situation constraints  also seem to be really useful in helping me push forward with the story creation, at least in Dogs...<br/>
<br/>
Do rule systems count as creative contraints? They'd almost have to - the rules you use would seem to have to constrain and direct the game you get, the things you create...                        </div>

                            I'm really happy with the way The Roach funnels play while allowing crazy freedom:<br/><br/>The game itself consists of six scenes, which you will chew through in about four hours.  They are always the same six scenes, in the same order.<br/><br/>You make four meaningful choices in defining your character.  Each is selecting from a list of maybe a dozen options.  It takes about a minute.<br/><br/>In each scene you draw a card that tells you something you must do.<br/><br/>So those are all pretty hard-core constraints - but that's absolutely it.  It's enough to keep the game focused, but not enough to feel confining in my experience.  To me it often feels like it amplifies or intensifies conflict to have hard and fast rules about the situation.                        </div>

                            I wrote a Spenserian sonnet for my wife on Valentine's day.  For those of you not in the know, a Spenserian sonnet has an even more restrictive rhyme scheme than a Shakespearean sonnet.  It's not the best poem I've ever written, but for me and my wife, it's the most valuable.                        </div>

                            Slight tangent...<br/>
<br/>
There's an idea in improvisation that a certain amount of constraint can spark creativity. For example: if I say "Think of a story, which has a rifle, a cloud and a bar of gold", then you'll probably think of something quite imaginative: more so than if I'd just said "Think of a story".<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if I'm too restrictive - "Think of a story set in a Elizabethan England involving a rifle which must never be fired in the story, a blue cloud and a bar of gold shaped like a small cottage" - then you won't think of anything good. Too much constraint shuts the creativity down.<br/>
<br/>
To answer John's question: I like to be constrained in the character that I play, because it forces me to play characters I wouldn't usually play.<br/>

                            Lately, my feelings about constraint have been "Please, sir, can I have some more."  I've been upping the constraint and downing conflict resolution mechanics.  I've discovered that, with the proper contraints in place (actual written contraints in this case, but of course you can substitute more Social Contract instead) you can dispense with conflict resolution entirely because players actions are never in conflict.  Cross-reference <a href="http://100flowers.indie-rpgs.com/waiting-tea.pdf" rel="nofollow">Waiting/Tea</a> and <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/01/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan.html" rel="nofollow">KKKKK</a>.<br/><br/>Also, more generally, I find the creative constraints of, say, Game Chef to be invigorating.  Figuring how to do something with limited options instead of infinite options is much more interesting, in my opinion.  This is also why I like games that actually tell you how to play them instead of saying, "You can do anything you want with this!"                        </div>

                            Bangs are certainly a constraint, in that the GM plans them and then constrains his play in order to bring them about.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about situation, though; situation is the stuff that becomes significant through play, and is more the result of constraints than a constraint itself.  I suppose you could constrain situatin by  genre convention or something (how much fuel you have is not important in hyperbolic space opera), but it's the genre convention that's the constraint, not the situation.

                            Joshua RamaGupta,<br/><br/>I think bangs are less a constraint than a motive force. However, heavily framed bangs certainly use constraints. (Ron's "you're in a bar fight and have three guys at your feet" example springs to mind.) <br/><br/>Situation builds constraints both in initial condition and emergent patterns, and so can be seen as a valid constraint, I think. If you are constrained in how you build the situation, it becomes a full narrative constraint. Dogs town creation, for example, forces you into a very specific set up, that will yield pretty focused results. It MUST ALL START WITH PRIDE. And there you go. <br/><br/>However, I don't know if its the kind of constraint you were talking about at first. To me that was more like My Life With Master -- you must do this until you have that, you must get this in manner X, you can only do other if you have yellow, and so on. In this case the narrative restraint is on the emergent patterns of play -- you can only do certain things at certain times because of rules restricting you moment to moment. <br/><br/>In real life I have a feeling these things are gong to melt into each other, and are only clearly different at the extreme edges.                        </div>

                            I mention Bangs because my favorite type of contraint is when the GM does something that I have to react to, often in a very specific way. Like in Josh's Dogs game where I played a Mountain Person convert. Everytime someone in the town blamed the Mountain People for whatever evil was going on, I had to react. I had a variety of options open to me, but I couldn't just let it go. So to answer John's question, I guess you could say that I like contraints that force me to act.<br/>

                            In RPGs, I like implied constraints best of all, especially those that are self-created (like Breaking the Ice's word-web) or those hidden in questions.  When a GM asks "why can't your character drive?" I barely even notice that my abilities have just been constrained--I'm too busy rising to the challenge of "cool reason I can't drive."  Similarly, when I'm GMing and a player puts "I want to find the world's greatest weapon" on a char sheet, I'm too busy trying to come up with a world's greatest weapon that will surprise and satisfy* the players to notice that my game world has been a little constrained around that flag.<br/><br/>Hmm...  that's a flag that's not a Bang, that establishes situation without being a town.  Is that what you meant by sitch-as-constraint, Paul?<br/><br/>(Shamelessly:  outside of RPGs, I like <a href="http://www.xorph.com/anacrusis/" rel="nofollow">word count restriction</a>.)<br/><br/>* No putting "the human heart."                        </div>
