The game-text is contains an element of superfluousness in that I've enjoyed successful <i>Paranoia</i> sessions both in strict adherence to the rules-as-written and setting-as-given, and sessions wherein the GM has ignored, embellished or altered entire tracts of the game-text. Delivering the information given by the text in an inexact manner doesn't impact on the quality of play - hence, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">text</span> is largely superfluous, well written or no. <br/><br/>What's important is the information itself. It would be interesting to take a <i>Paranoia</i> player who hasn't read the rules and have them GM, and see if the fiction, and our relationship with it, changes. <br/><br/>Further questions: How much do we rely on the physical construction/composure of a game? Could the experience of <i>Shadowrun</i>, <i>Mouseguard</i>, <i>Dogs...</i> or <i>Polaris</i> be had removed from the game-text? Could you, the prospective GM (or initiator), be given the concept via <i>word-of-mouth</i> and just run with it? <br/>(I'm not hopeful for 'yes' answers - but it's an interesting thought.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261887/#Comment_261887" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T07:31:34+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  7:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In general I think of them as guidelines that are waiting to <i>become</i> rules<br/><br/>In other words, if we're going to run a game, we evaluate the book and work out what its rules are, then what those rules are supposed to accomplish, then put that in context with what our gaming group wants out of the game, then make adjustments accordingly.  Whoever wrote the book got paid for the product up front and is never, ever going to play it with us, so now it belongs entirely to us to do whatever we want with it.  I'm happy to try and accommodate the rules-as-written whenever possible (that's part of the value of buying the book in the first place, to be able to use someone else's hard work for our game), but the bottom line is that it's a set of tools for us to use, not a straitjacket.<br/><br/>Depending on the game, we may use nearly all of the rules as written.  Or we might ignore a few of them.  Or we might ignore nearly all of them, or eliminate an entire subcategory of rules that aren't useful to us.  We may rewrite, repurpose, or replace the setting.  We might graft on selected chunks from other games, in extreme cases.  But in all of those cases, my hope is that we do everything <i>mindfully</i>, knowing why we are using or not using the rules and paying attention to how it affects our gaming experience.  I like to think that we are always responsible for making our own sessions work, no matter what book we are using (or abusing, as the case may be).<br/><br/><br/><br/>...which may be why I have such an immediate, nearly-instinctive negative reaction to people talking about the importance of always following the rules in the book, or criticizing people for drifting them, or disparaging any advice about changing rules.  We try new things all the time, but it's always with an eye towards stealing the best ideas and best practices from those new books so that we can add them to our toolbox...and we're not shy about using that toolbox on the new games, too, when we think it'll make our night more enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261896/#Comment_261896" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T09:56:07+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  9:56AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah I (and my players incidently) find it much easier to break rules than ignore guidelines. <br/><br/>Makes for interesting Kills Puppies Games (GM&gt; their more like guidelines Players&gt; Oh shit, we better not fuck with those Gm&gt;?!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261899/#Comment_261899" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T10:16:58+00:00" title="March 14, 2010 10:16AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it is a more "Traditional Game" and I've already been taught how to play it, I skip everything between the statblocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261908/#Comment_261908" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T11:05:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2010 11:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2010 11:06AM by nikodemus.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're not even guidelines.

Take cover.)<br/><br/>I was talking to Jonathan about this topic over beers last night. When I'm trying something new (snowboarding, jiu-jitsu, an rpg) I like to try to empty my mind of its assumptions and habits and be open to the new thing on its own terms. This is very hard to do -- which is one of the reasons it's worth trying.<br/><br/>So, with that mindset, I try to approach a game text with the intention to discover what it wants of me. Like, when you're at a club and you start dancing with a stranger. Or the first day at a new job. Sure, you might have all this expertise and ideas of your own, but you need to hold back at first, read the situation, ease into it.<br/><br/>I'd like playing a new game to be something of a surprise or a revelation to me, not just more of the same stuff I do already but with different dice mechanics.<br/><br/>So I guess my answer is: I try to follow the rules. I also try to embody the persona of the player the text is aimed at. To go and live in the game's country, so to speak, rather than dragging it across the border and expecting it to speak my language.<br/><br/>Man, there are a lot of weird metaphors in this post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261946/#Comment_261946" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T16:00:06+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  4:00PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2010 4:00PM by Epidiah_Ravachol.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Or the first day at a new job.</blockquote>\nI use that metaphor in Time &amp; Temp, and it's pretty much my policy on role-playing games in general.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>General Management Policy</cite>You know how when you first start a job, you\u2019re eager to please and follow all the instructions to the letter.

If, as you\u2019re playing the game, you go too far afield and things start to drag, come on back to the trusty General Management Policy and see if that doesn\u2019t help.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261975/#Comment_261975" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T00:24:41+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 12:24AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favorite game designers makes games that could be considered nothing but guidelines. I look at his stuff and it strikes me like more of a themed recipe book than a game with hard rules.<br/><br/>It's a very different sort of mindset, but one I like just as well as the <i>follow the rules and watch what happens </i>mindset I associate with dirty-hippy games.<br/><br/>Could I run a game successfully that I'd received only by word of mouth?<br/><br/><i>Maybe.</i> If it was a dirty-hippy game, I'd expect it to turn out significantly differently than using the actual game. A more traditional game I'd expect to be closer to the original, but still noticably different from what it would be like using the actual rules.<br/><br/>OTOH, I'm reminded of stuff I've heard about a guy named Paddy Griffith and the development of his "Mugger Games" miniature wargames. Apparently he'd heard third-hand about these historical toy soldier games, then tried creating his own with little contact with minis gamer culture and expected rules/mechanics/system.

But I still closely follow rules. <br/><br/>Why? <br/><br/>Because I want to learn something new. If I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t spend money on a new game. <br/><br/>Game rules teach. When I go to class, I check my ego at the door and open myself to new things. Even if later I decide I don\u2019t agree with the lesson. But if I don\u2019t listen first, my judgments later are potentially ignorant. <br/><br/>When we assume we know, we stop listening and stop learning. <br/><br/>Is a designer\u2019s vision always sacred? <br/><br/>No. <br/><br/>It depends on how much they playtested. Regardless if you are a professional or a hobbyist, on paper rules may look brilliant. But in play that brilliance can quickly turn into incoherence. The opposite is also true. Rules may seem simple on paper but are brilliant in play. And there are emergent qualities. People interacting with rules and rules interacting with other seemingly separate rules lead to unpredictable effects. The only way to know is to playtest. How sacred a game\u2019s rules are is completely dependant on how much they were playtested and the quality and diversity of that playtesting. <br/><br/>Designer vision only matters in how much that vision was sharpened and tested before being handed over to you. <br/><br/>But playtesting isn\u2019t enough.<br/><br/>Rules can become guidelines by the sheer volume of rules. <br/><br/>If the rules can\u2019t be summarized in 3 pages, if the extended rules can\u2019t be easily referenced, and if the very basic rules can\u2019t be communicated by word of mouth, then your rules automatically become guidelines due to simple logistics.<br/><br/>But easy reference isn\u2019t enough.<br/><br/>Even if your rules are few and easily referenced, if they aren\u2019t clearly communicated with numerous reminders, then they may also become guidelines inadvertently due to simple miscommunication and misunderstanding. <br/><br/>The fact that games have errata or new editions underline that rules are guidelines. <br/><br/>But I still use them as rules till I intimately understand them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262038/#Comment_262038" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T11:09:52+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 11:09AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating... fascinating! <br/><br/>Let's moving away from <i>rules</i> for the moment and turn the discussion back to the other side of <i>"How far do you use the average game-text?"</i>, which is, in this case, how far do you use the setting<i>-as-written</i>?<br/><br/>Do you pass over elements you don't like (or play them down) and emphasis ones you do, or do you aspire to the writer's perceived vision?

This of course was long ago, before I'd come across hippy-concepts like OoG/pregame group discussions about what folks wanted in a game. It made for unhappy GMing.<br/><br/>These days I much prefer a more dirty-hippy take on things. Give a basic sense for the kinds of things in the setting and the types of adentures/issues involved, then flesh it out as you go through group feedback in play. Weirdly, that strikes me as kinda sorta old-skool, as it is pretty much how I played D&amp;D when I first started and hadn't seen any world/setting stuff yet ( the Greyhawk boxed set being only acquired after some time gaming already).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262051/#Comment_262051" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T11:48:02+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 11:48AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as system goes, how far I try to play by the RAW depends entirely on what I'm doing. John and John laid out good reasons for why I play by the RAW when I'm interested in stretching/learning/doing somethiing new. OTOH, other times I just want to chill and have fun, at which point I'm going to do exactly whatever the fuck my group and I want to do. Notably, half the time these days this means we just pull out some vague semi-freeform semi-based of Solar System mishmash from hell and play the way we always play. At that point, why do a new system when we're not going to use it? <br/><br/>As for setting, I find it hard to answer the question because it depends so much on how the setting is presented. In the average World of Darkness game, as an example, I'll usually use much of the tone and texture from the book, with many of the "gadgets" (like Oneriomancy in Changeling) -- but won't try to stick to any specific elements in the game that hard. OTOH, with a game like Dogs in the Vineyard where the game setting really is tone and texture plus gadgets, I'm going to use almost everything from the setting as written. And in a game where the "setting" is imbedded in the rules, like say Burning Wheel, I'm probably going to use both pretty close to the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262068/#Comment_262068" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T12:42:20+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 12:42PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Brand said about setting! <br/><br/>Hell, as I was typing before I read what he wrote, I was even using his same examples (except replace World of Darkness with Shadowrun).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262129/#Comment_262129" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T17:37:47+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  5:37PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The job metaphor falls short for me because <em>games should not be work</em>.

The key is to focus on what the similarities the between the components might illuminate rather then how they are different.
