So they make it look like<i>an edition from the early 80s that people new to D&amp;D have never even heard of and have no sentimental attachment to, with graphic design that is almost 30 years out of date</i>?<br/><br/>I really, really don't get it. They're going to sell a bunch of copies to people nostalgic about earlier editions; that's all.<br/><br/>I mean, I'm happy for all you folks who get shivers about this, because that retro-ness is way cool, but -- as a product aimed at a new audience -- total failure.</blockquote>\nThe point that D&amp;D is marketed badly is not one I'd argue. Although someone else might.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure that the retro red box approach is so terrible.<br/><br/>It won't appeal to someone who has no interest in gaming anyway, sure. But "nerd stuff" has a cachet in popular culture, and lots of people know what D&amp;D is, even if they never played it.<br/><br/>So, if you showed this new "red box" edition to someone, alongside a more "modern" looking book, I'm not sure the retro look wouldn't be more appealing. People know what "old-school" looks like, even if they don't have a lot of other context.<br/><br/>(To take another tack, the graphic design of this game got me interested, and I don't currently play D&amp;D, but I take Jonathan's point that nostalgia gamers aren't the best target audience.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254900/#Comment_254900" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T20:46:56+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  8:46PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a detached point of view, I think the switch to a box set is brilliant; it's a self-contained system that has presence. I would have preferred this over the three hardbacks. From my gamer perspective, I have to admit that I'm a little leery regarding the situation:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the Monster Vault and Dungeon Master's Kit likely won't have any more information than the Monster Manual and Dungeon Master's Guide, the Player Essentials seem peculiar. Without a detailed table of contents, now I have to wonder if there's any new information that I would likely need. As strange as this sounds, it throws off my sense of aesthetics: all the books I use are hardback, these are trade paperbacks. Irrational it may be, but I'm compulsive that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I also have to wonder if they're going to drop the current crop of hardbacks after the release of the Monster Manual 3. Not only is it a change in format, but I would hope they avoid trying to support what amounts to Basic D&amp;D; and AD&amp;D; all over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the idea; I just think it's two years too late.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254902/#Comment_254902" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T20:49:38+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  8:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think anyone should believe that the cover on WotC's site is the real, final cover.

I mean, I could be wrong, and that is the final cover, but honestly I think faking a Red Box look *is* a marketing ploy... to get us old timers all fired up about it, so we maybe want to buy it for our kids or whatever.

But I remember being TOTALLY EXCITED about that original red box game. Goblins! Rust monsters! <br/><br/>I definitely wasn't disappointed about no dragons.

It's a 1-5 player cooperative dungeon adventure game. There are a variety of scenarios, some dungeon tiles to lay out a random dungeon, a bunch of unpainted minis, and a bunch of event cards. As part of each player's turn they draw a card that tells them how to move the monsters, so the challenge scales with the number of players like Pandemic.<br/><br/>That sounds totally great! Kind of like Arkham Asylum. When I played (DM'd) 4E I kept wondering why it wasn't a board game in the first place, and not needing a DM (an utterly boring job in 4E) would be great!

If I remember right it was a young white dragon (a level 3 brute, which as about as weak as dragons get in D&amp;D), and a really damn difficult battle, but also one of the more memorable fights in the campaign.

I don't think calling it the red box is a bad idea either. You are right that newbs don't know the reference. The older gamers who do can have a powerful effect if it's a product they get excited about though. People who were teenagers in the 80s are parents now and they can buy this for their kids, nephews, or nieces. Other older gamers might get it as a gift for someone they think would like roleplaying because they still have positive associations with the original red box. <br/><br/>The Essentials line as a whole I'm not sure about. It looks like it's going to create a parallel line of products to the current line. That seems like it'd increase newb confusion, as what books to get won't really be obvious when you are standing in a store aisle. I wonder if the line is less a bold new strategy and more a tacit admission that their original strategy is failing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255894/#Comment_255894" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T05:30:41+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  5:30AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2010 5:31AM by NoahTheDuke.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>That looks like Penny Arcade art, and prob is....
