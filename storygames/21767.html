I'll go into the details if it becomes relevant, but the gist is that I was intuitively making my character's decisions based on inhabiting them in that moment of the fiction, and I announced what they were doing, only to then be reminded that that wouldn't be compatible with the pre-scripted plot.<br/><br/>This was kind of a bummer for me, because these were very much character-arc-focused games.  Waiting until Act 5 to take a stand for what my character believes just feels weird to me if a moment arrives in Act 3 that I react to with, "That does it!  I know where I stand now!"<br/><br/>I realize this isn't an issue if the plot is <i>entirely</i> pre-scripted, but as far as I understand it, Montsegur 1244, Mars 244, and Witch: Road to Lindisfarne all use limited scripting in service to a "play to find out" agenda.<br/><br/>Does anyone else have experience with this sort of clash between the plan and the emergent moment?<br/><br/>Does anyone else who's played these specific games think I'm playing them wrong?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476094/#Comment_476094" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T19:21:12+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  7:21PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing with partially pre-scripted plot arc games is that it's assuming one of your core goals in play is telling a good story, one that follows the game's dramaturgical arcs, not embodying the character in the moment. <br/>Your choices in this kind of game should be made first based on what suits the story, and then tempered by what your character would do. (i.e., there's something that would make for really good fiction, but the first thing you imagined wouldn't suit your character, so then you adapt it to what your character would do). <br/><br/>So tldr, I kind of think you're playing them wrong. <br/>But also, I feel that partially pre-scripted that's shooting for "play to find out" is a bad idea on a design level, and that if you're going to have a game pre-script, you should go all the way and have everything pre-scripted, with the goal in play being to explore how things happen instead of learning what happens.<br/>So basically, you're playing them wrong, but it's not your fault, because there's some issues with the format.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476097/#Comment_476097" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T20:37:34+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  8:37PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 8:38PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I feel that partially pre-scripted that's shooting for "play to find out" is a bad idea on a design level</p></div></blockquote>I disagree!

It's just that, if those things are never ever in any sort of doubt, then your character isn't really a star of the show.  Which is fine, especially in a larger group -- you can still contribute plenty, with flair and personality and by being a foil for the other characters.  But other characters will keep us in more suspense and probably get more attention, if what I've seen is typical.<br/><br/>These games are set up to provide a lot of fodder to put a character's "position" to the test, so on the one hand, there should still be dramatic uncertainty there, no matter how rigid you start out.  On the other hand, if you really do ignore the intended tests of faith, then you're declining to engage with a core component of play.<br/><br/>You can certainly end up where you started!  But if there's no struggle or doubt, then I don't think anyone will care where you end up.<br/><br/>And if there <i>is</i> struggle and doubt, then sometimes I wind up really feelin' something that turns out to clash with the script...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476116/#Comment_476116" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T15:58:28+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  3:58PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne</i> has provided me some of the most satisfying play of my gaming experience, both as a player and a GM/facilitator. <br/><br/>We usually make it really clear to players at the start of play, what the boundaries are.

The thing that's important to me is that the stance shift be <i>distinct</i>, rather than muddy.<br/><br/>So, let's say it's my turn to frame a scene in Witch.  My character is Sir Thorne.  I start out in Director Stance and set up a scene between Thorne and Eloise.  Once I'm done describing the situation, I jump into Actor Stance and roleplay out Thorne's actions and speech.  As Thorne, I decide to let Eloise go free.  I do <i>not</i> think to myself, "Dave, the rules say Eloise <i>can't</i> go free, so play Thorne differently."  <b>(Key # 1!)</b> Then, once Thorne has freed Eloise, I shift from Actor Stance to go solve the problem of getting Eloise re-captured in Director Stance.  So, I might narrate an avalanche which closes off Eloise's path of escape, forcing her into the area where Ham and Brother Armond are looking for her.  <br/><br/>Or, if it feels really underwhelming to me to be the one meddling with the consequences of my own character's decision, I'll throw it out to someone else:<br/>"Okay, Eloise's player, tell us what happens to force Eloise back to where Ham and Armond find her."<br/>"Okay, Armond's player, tell us how Armond sees through Thorne's attempt to cover Eloise's tracks."<br/><br/>And then, in Director Stance, I will <i>also</i> do what I can to make sure that Thorne's attempt to free the witch, despite failing, still <i>matters</i>.  <b>(Key # 2!)</b>  So, if necessary, I might narrate something that makes it completely obvious to Armond that Thorne let Eloise go, so now we get to see what comes of <i>that</i>.  <br/><br/>(I'd generally like Thorne's decision to matter in the fiction, but honestly, simply mattering at the table can suffice.  If the other players are all like, "Wow, Dave, Thorne has really had an enormous change of heart!  Didn't see that coming!" then I'm probably content.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>I started this thread to ask how to hit Key # 1 and Key # 2 without breaking the rules, if possible.  After playing the game again last night, now I have my answer: yes, it <i>is</i> possible, as long as I do my character exploration in my preferred fashion (actor stance), and then <i>separately</i> do my situation generation in my preferred fashion for <i>that</i> (director stance with an eye on <i>both</i> the consequences of character actions <i>and</i> creating the rules' pre-established outcome).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And perhaps making that official?</p></div></blockquote>If I were re-designing Witch for people like me, yes, I would absolutely make this separation of tasks official.<br/><br/>I might be in the minority of people who care about such details, though.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479554/#Comment_479554" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-07T16:21:01+00:00" title="January  7, 2019  4:21PM">January 7</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2019 4:26PM by David_Berg.">edited January 7</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Or, if it feels really underwhelming to me to be the one meddling with the consequences of my own character's decision, I'll throw it out to someone else:<br/>"Okay, Eloise's player, tell us what happens to force Eloise back to where Ham and Armond find her."<br/>"Okay, Armond's player, tell us how Armond sees through Thorne's attempt to cover Eloise's tracks."</p></div></blockquote>Just to elaborate: obviously in this example I'm still the one deciding <i>roughly</i> how Eloise is recaptured; I'm just enlisting someone else to flesh it out and make it actually happen in the fiction.  <br/><br/>If, on the other hand, I really want nothing <i>at all</i> to do with the recapture, then that should be an option too -- <i>everyone</i> knows where Eloise needs to wind up, so I should be able to leave it to the other players to make that happen.

So perhaps it'd be a minor technique for some.  It's pretty big for me, though.<br/><br/>The majority of folks I've played scripted RPGs with have <i>not</i> engaged this technique, even in cases where I'd wager it would have improved the fun.  So, obvious from a distance perhaps, but clearly not obvious in the moment.<br/><br/>Yes, I would roleplay Thorne's decision to kill Ham and Armond all the way through the point where that decision was final -- let's say "sword in mid-swing".  And then I'd stop roleplaying Thorne, and we'd figure out how to get from "sword in mid-swing" to where we needed to wind up (Eloise back on the road to Lindisfarne).<br/><br/>When I played Mars 244 (a hack of Montsegur 1244), I attempted some pretty bold character stuff that I had to backtrack a bit because the rest of the group wasn't prepared to help dig me out of the hole I was creating relative to the script.  Most of the players spent their whole in-character time just talking about their feelings and not trying to change anything, which I found underwhelming.  So I think there's a relevant <i>group</i> decision to be made about whether my approach of <i>passionately roleplaying characters as if (in that moment) there is no script</i> is welcome or unwelcome.  And then, depending on that decision, different techniques would be appropriate, and those could probably stand to be articulated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479565/#Comment_479565" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-08T05:49:01+00:00" title="January  8, 2019  5:49AM">January 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you are saying.

I can't do both at once and really enjoy it.  Doing them in sequence, though, worked out just fine, as long as I was clear on which I was doing when.<br/><br/>One key was to <i>not</i> author actions for my character during scene framing.  Happenstance, acts of nature, NPCs, sure -- anything to keep the plot on track <i>except</i> "I guess my character goes this way for the sake of the plot".<br/><br/>By the way you played Ham, I know you're with me on this!  "No, he's not going to do something nonsensical to get himself caught, but he could get injured in a freak avalanche."<br/><br/>In player mode, you play Ham; in GM mode, you play the avalanche.<br/><br/>I think it's natural to get muddy with this in Witch, because if it's "your scene", you may well be playing Ham <i>and</i> the environment in the same scene.  And if you're bouncing back and forth between describing Ham's actions and describing the pretty scenery, there's really no problem in <i>that</i> case, so it can seem like a natural way to play.<br/><br/>Heck, I guess it's even <i>possible</i> to play Ham running from an NPC, and then grab the GM hat and narrate the NPC shooting Ham in the back, and then resume playing Ham to beg for mercy, and then GM again and have the NPC ready a fatal blow.  But I would find it hard to play Ham in any way that felt authentic to me if I was ping-ponging that fast.  Distinct stance shifts suit me much better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479797/#Comment_479797" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-17T14:29:40+00:00" title="January 17, 2019  2:29PM">January 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games have constraints.

You'll recall him lifting up and kissing a small child suffering of the Plague on our first scene.<br/><br/>I wasn't yet sure whether he already knew about it, or whether that moment would just foreshadow him getting sick later.<br/><br/>I also decided that he must believe in the IDEA that burning a witch could redeem and save us all (or at least himself), so that he had a purpose to be on the journey in the first place.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I wanted to stay open to exploring his feelings for the Witch as the game went along. There were scenes where I felt he was sympathetic to the witch (remember, I'd established that he thought he might be her illegitimate father!), and other scenes where he thought burning her was worth it.<br/><br/>I also established in my mind (via those flashbacks/vignettes) that Thorne had been traumatized by being forced to carry out immoral orders during the Crusades, so he wouldn't do anything just because someone ordered him to.<br/><br/>That gave me a character who had a variety of possible motivations and reasons to either go along with the burning or to go turn against it.<br/><br/>I also realized after a handful of scenes that Thorne was searching for a moral authority, which he found in Brother Armond.<br/><br/>I very deliberately didn't actually commit to a decision until the final scene, because that seemed to me like the most interesting way to play the game - if the whole point was to make this decision, then making it upfront would be undercutting the purpose of the game. (Like deciding what bets you're going to make before you even meet your Poker opponent or see your cards.)<br/><br/>However - and I guess this is the important part here - I very deliberately established a character for myself who wouldn't be, say, automatically opposed to the idea of witchery and human sacrifice from the get-go. If that was Thorne, his most rational course of action would be to let her out of the cage at the first possible opportunity and flee into the countryside with her, running from the guards or fleeing the country. <br/><br/>No, he had to be the kind of character who had the potential to believe in this whole thing, or turn against it, depending on how things played out. That, to me, was the whole point of playing. I would give the character a starting position and then vicariously experience his final decision, depending on how the journey shaped his feelings about the whole situation.<br/><br/>But he WAS committed to taking the Witch to Lindisfarne. In my mind he saw that as a way to repay the moral debt of being a deserter in the Crusades - carrying out this task, at whatever cost, was his way of redeeming himself and his honour and he would not flinch from it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479934/#Comment_479934" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-22T18:48:44+00:00" title="January 22, 2019  6:48PM">January 22</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2019 6:49PM by David_Berg.">edited January 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>he had to be the kind of character who had the potential to believe in this whole thing, or turn against it, depending on how things played out.

We'd prefer the characters to be committed to the premise the game expects from them, but we also need them to be believable.<br/><br/>Surely, there is a level of circumstance to which Thorne's only reasonable response would be to free the Witch. (Because to do otherwise would simply break our suspension of disbelief.)<br/><br/>How do we deal with that "grey area"? Both pitfalls are game-breakers, in my opinion.<br/><br/>However, the idea that we can have attempts to free the Witch (which I'm using as shorthand for any actions which deviate from the agreed-upon plot) but that we all know that we will reverse their effects by consensus before moving to the next scene or Act doesn't excite or inspire me a whole lot.<br/>It's a sort of false tension we're pretending to harness which doesn't do it for me.<br/><br/>The particular idea of "attempts to free<br/>the Witch" is interesting, because it still plays into the premise (a judgement on her eventual fate) and adds to the characters.<br/><br/>But there are also many other such options which would not add anything to the game, by refusing to engage with the themes of the game.<br/><br/>Ultimately, to me, I think that is a matter of taste rather than something which has a clear answer.<br/><br/>I can see having an interesting game of Witch where the entire group decides to free her - or to kill her! - in the third scene.<br/><br/>That would be a failure to play the game for some people, and a resounding success for others (depending on how compelling it was to them).<br/><br/>If I felt that was a really cool and compelling outcome, I wouldn't want it reversed in director stance between scenes: I'd want it played to the hilt.<br/><br/>It's not an obvious thing to negotiate, though!

Just that the <i>execution</i> matters. If we're all doing the "we're committed to getting to Lindisfarne together" in a way which is cool and compelling, I'm enjoying the game. But if it feels uninspired because everyone feels their character would actually abandon the journey and free the witch, then we're failing.<br/><br/>Contrariwise, if we all decide that our characters abandon the journey, and that *feels right* and is compelling to us, then that's what we should do.<br/><br/>That's why it's not just a social contract issue to me; it's also about what happens in the fiction and how it feels in the moment. <br/><br/>Once we get to that point, though, as you say, it becomes purely about the people and we have to negotiate at the human level.<br/><br/>It's certainly *safer* to just agree to the premise before we play (in this case, that the witch will reach Lindisfarne alive and caged), but then we run into the problem you're describing here.<br/><br/>Again, for me it's much easier to do if I author that as a character motivation to begin with. It's not difficult for me to picture that my character has a strong sense of duty or obligation he's rationalized for himself. In this case it was something like, "I see it as my moral duty to bring this girl to Lindisfarne, no matter what, and I will see myself as a failure if I do not do that, at a level which is completely unacceptable to me", but also that I've kind of failed to think it through and could totally change my mind about the "burning to death" part.<br/><br/>This isn't weird for me, nor hard to believe - people do this kind of thing all the time, where they fail to think something through until they get to the end of the road and are suddenly struck with something they hadn't considered. Rationalizing that away is very human, in my experience of our land-dwelling species!<br/><br/>Maybe, in our case, Thorne was convinced that he was doing god's work, and, therefore, <i>surely</i> the divine spirit would intercede and give him the courage and determination to do what needs to be done by the end of the journey, even he didn't have it now? <br/><br/>He could just commit to making good on the journey, and then leave the final decision in the hands of god. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Huh!

I feel that, by creating a motivated character who is basically in line with the premise of the game, I do *far less* violence to the integrity of the character.<br/><br/>It's much easier for me to imagine, in-character, that my character might hesitate just a little longer and not rescue the witch <i>just yet</i> (I suppose because character and audience interests are lining up here, and it's just very plausible to me) than it would be to play out the rescue attempt and <i>then</i> somehow step out of character and contrive a way to get the character back on track. That would take me out of character far more.<br/><br/>In other words, given the endpoint the game presents, it's fairly easy for me to rationalize the character holding off on his decision until we reach Lindisfarne than it would be to commit fully to impulses in the moment and then, afterwards, have to retcon and "rewrite" that somehow from director stance. In the former case, I feel like I am very much "using the character to address the situation". In the latter, it's like I have to, first, "use the character to address the situation", but then also somehow remove the consequences of that action in "editing", making it more or less meaningless as well doing violence to the character concept (or, at least, the integrity of the character's psychological state, as it exists in my imagination).<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure we're talking about the same thing, though, and neither do I have a great deal of experience with this kind of play. Does that make more or less sense than what I said before?<br/><br/>I find the question this thread poses *extremely* valuable and relevant - it's certainly not a waste of time! In fact, I'm pretty sure we're looking for solutions to the same problem, so it's interesting to see whether we, in fact, have different priorities/preferences when it comes to this kind of thing or we're just misunderstanding each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479948/#Comment_479948" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-23T00:56:58+00:00" title="January 23, 2019 12:56AM">January 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It's certainly *safer* to just agree to the premise before we play (in this case, that the witch will reach Lindisfarne alive and caged), but then we run into the problem you're describing here.</p></div></blockquote>I'd rather play Witch as designed and solve whatever problems that creates.

One that I like a lot. Perhaps it's not David's cup of tea, though. Or perhaps it's two different, related techniques.<br/><br/>Technique 1: Why would my character not do that?<br/>This technique is about inventing a reason on the fly. I realize it feels like my character really would free the witch now. This thing would set him over the edge. But I know he won't. Why? I invent a reason in his background, in the situation, in his though process. Perhaps he looks at the witch and sees something that causes him to doubt again. Perhaps he has a flashback to a scene where he let a criminal go and that criminal killed his uncle (the Spiderman trick!). Etc. Make up a reason.<br/><br/>Technique 2: Why don't I do that?<br/>This is an amazing technique that has led to some of the best gaming experiences of my life. I look at the witch. I can't take it. She's obviously innocent. The right thing to do is to let her go. I'm a good man who always do the right thing. And yet ... I don't do it. I just sit here. I can tell she's innocent and I'm too cowardly to let her go.<br/>Doing something that breaks with my image of the character and, even worse, breaks with my character's image of himself, can be really powerful. This can trigger a major identity crisis in my character. I'm not the person I thought I was. When push comes to shove I don't stand up straight and do what's right, but rather sit here and do nothing, because nobody else is doing anything. That's a pretty realistic scenario (look up the bystander effect), too.<br/><br/>I've used these techniques a number of times when the rules tell me to do something that I feel is out of character. Just rolling with it and saying "OK, so I do this thing (or I don't do this thing). What does that mean for the story and/or character?" can create some really interesting things, and in the second case, trigger a major turning point in the character. It's probably not something that David will like, since he's into straight Actor Stance, but I really like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479960/#Comment_479960" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-24T02:39:56+00:00" title="January 24, 2019  2:39AM">January 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2019 2:43AM by Paul_T.">edited January 24</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>That's excellent.

I'm poking at it because the technique you're describing, for me, does more violence to the experience of playing the game in-character, rather than less. So, I recognize the problem, but I feel like the solution you're talking about sounds like a lot more work to me, not less.

I'm equally thrown/confused by your reply in the other thread, so maybe I'll step back and think things over for a few days and then get back to you.<br/><br/><br/>Quick edit: The reason the whole scene with the heretics/cultists attacking the travelers was difficult for me was for (I think) exactly them same - or perhaps just very very closely related - reason. In short, a constraint had been applied to the story (in this case, the danger and its very specific resolution), and that made it really hard to play my character authentically: I was thrown entirely out of Actor Stance, but without the authority to narrate my own outcome outside of character, as well. We should probably stick to discussing that in the other thread, but I thought I'd mention it here, because I see it as part of the same phenomenon (or, at least, it feels really similar to me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479982/#Comment_479982" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-24T20:37:11+00:00" title="January 24, 2019  8:37PM">January 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2019 6:23PM by David_Berg.">edited January 25</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm poking at it because the technique you're describing, for me, does more violence to the experience of playing the game in-character, rather than less.

First, is your solution "more work", but doing less violence to the character? Naturally, we're not necessarily going to agree on this 100%, since we're talking largely about player preference and personal experience.<br/><br/>However, I can try to explain my point of view. Perhaps that would be helpful!<br/><br/>I think that the use of one type of solution over the other really depends heavily on the specifics. I really don't think that one is always going to be better than the other; the particular situation matters a great deal. Having this other technique, in that sense, is really handy, and I'll be keeping it close by in my future gaming. Where I disagree, though, is that it's categorically better.<br/><br/>We have the first approach, which is to consider the constraints of the game as you're playing, and to keep an eye on the developing fiction for possible conflicts. This requires a little bit of effort/attention all the time, which is not ideal (although, as Adam and I seem to have argued, that's pretty much always present in gaming). When a possible conflict occurs, the player tries to compromise on their current idea of how to play the character in the minimal way necessary to make their choices in the scene more in line with the constraints of the game.<br/><br/>In the second approach, we free ourselves to play the character "in the moment", but, at the same time, keep an eye on the developing fiction for possible conflicts, so we can "pause" the action or cut the scene, and then revert to an out-of-character perspective to "fix" the problem. I like the clarity involved in separating the two phases; that's definitely a strength of the technique.<br/><br/>However, I am arguing that this *still* requires us to keep an eye on what's developing and then to remember to pause or reframe early enough to catch the problem. (Or, otherwise, to retcon after the fact, which I find pretty suboptimal.)<br/><br/>Where the "violence to the character" comes in has to do with the nature of the editing/change we have to get into.<br/><br/>For illustration, let's take your earlier problem example:<br/><br/><b><i>Somewhere along the journey, Sir Thorne decides that he should free the witch and kill the others.</i></b><br/><br/>How do we play this?<br/><br/>If I'm using the first technique, I become aware that this contradicts the pre-established plot constraints. Now I ponder, from his perspective, if there might be some way to reconcile those two demands. Very often, I find, a very simple and entirely believable solution presents itself.<br/><br/>For instance: perhaps I decide that Sir Thorne is now convinced that the Witch is innocent and that he is willing to kill the others, as above, BUT I also decide that he doesn't feel capable of fighting the others. It wouldn't be hard to justify: I can narrate that his sword is broken, decide that he has weakness or illness, simply assume that is afraid of one of the others because of something he heard, decide that he thinks he will be paid or otherwise rewarded when he reaches Lindisfarne, and that's worth sticking around for, and so on. I would pick something which aligns very naturally with what we've established so far - chances are that there is some bit of fiction or character dynamics which would easily justify the choice.<br/><br/>Most easily and reasonably, however, I could even do far better and easier: yes, Thorne *wants* to do this, but he is suffering from indecision and moral cowardice. He will hold off until the last possible moment, because he's afraid to actually make this decision.<br/><br/>Or, perhaps, there is something about Lindisfarne that makes him feel his plan is more likely to work once we get there. (For example, maybe Thorne decides in that moment that the journey is long, and the others are likely to fall sick or die before we get there, so it's to his advantage to delay as long as possible.)<br/><br/>By picking an option that's very closely in line with his character, personality, and the circumstances, I do very little "violence" to the character. Often, to me, it doesn't even feel like any kind of "violence", because I'm filling a whole in the fiction in my mind that hasn't been established yet. (For example, in our game, I had hinted that Thorne was infected with the Plague, but we didn't know the extent of that. It would be easy to decide that he was, in fact, in terrible pain and suffering (perhaps to the point where he is afraid to even try to pick up his own sword!), but had been hiding this so far, out of pride. That doesn't change much about the character or how I (in this example) was picturing him, not at all - it just adds another detail I hadn't been sure about. Game fiction is pretty much always full of such little lacunae we haven't described or decided yet; all I have to do is think of one and colour it in appropriately.)<br/><br/>In this sense, it feels very natural and very organic. It's also interesting to play out - I can spend the rest of the game hinting at his inner conflict, experiencing it as the player, and so forth (and it will enrich the game going forward, for everyone). Deciding that Thorne will hesitate is very natural, very believable, and doesn't force me to change much (if anything) about how this character acts and feels. Moments later, I'm back to playing the character, no terrible damage done, and I'm still 100% "in the game".<br/><br/>The alternative, under the second technique, if I'm understanding it correctly, is that I follow my impulses rather unabashedly, and we go to the point of Thorne letting the Witch out of the cage, and, perhaps, even to the point of swinging his sword down onto the sleeping forms of his companions... and then we pause the action and start brainstorming how we get out of this mess.<br/><br/>This has many benefits, too, and one of the main ones is the drama and excitement of such decisive action taking place: that would be a cool scene! I like the freedom this gives us.<br/><br/>However, where it gets difficult for me is that now... well, here we are, Thorne with his sword raised, and it's not exactly clear how we will get out of this, and we start negotiating and brainstorming. In my mind, though, Thorne is committed: there's not much room for changing his mind here - after all, he's deliberated about this long enough that he's gone through with the whole plan, including letting the Witch out of her cage and committing to the murder of his companions.<br/><br/>NOW I'm supposed to conceive of some convoluted way not only to justify how the murders don't happen, but also how the Witch is recaptured (granted, that's probably the easiest part), and, as well, how Thorne can be placated or intimidated into agreeing to back down and <i>not to try this again</i>. Given how much he's put on the line to do this in the first place, what would that even take?<br/><br/>This part, to me, feels like rewriting the character, his priorities, his interests, and the fictional situation in general. I am now completely at odds with the character, too, as a player/author, because I am forced to advocate against his best interests. It's very likely that whatever we come up with could change the very character concept dramatically, perhaps even to the point where I don't like him anymore or don't understand who he is.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480015/#Comment_480015" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-28T20:23:36+00:00" title="January 28, 2019  8:23PM">January 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep in mind that's not *always* going to play out like this; especially, given less commitment to an irrevocable course of action, the latter could sometimes be easier and smoother. But my experience has often been close to the example I just described.<br/><br/>In fact, I think we saw that in our own game: once Ham let the Witch go and fled from the group, we had a very similar situation. Ham had decided he was going to go. But we reframed the scene so it was believable that he would be caught. But, what now? He was still convinced he should go (and we hadn't decided to force such a complete character change as to make him want to stay). And that's exactly what he did in the very next scene. In other words, if our goal was to stick to the pre-established plot constraints, we failed completely (i.e. he never made it to Lindisfarne). If our goal was to ensure that his actions had consequences, no matter whether they followed the plot constraints or not, then we failed at that, too (i.e. we would have been better off just having him flee successfully the first time he tried).<br/><br/>That's rather long-winded, but I hope it illustrates my experience with this kind of thing. Again, it's not 100% consistent; there will be situations where it might be the other way around. For me, I think, keeping both techniques under my hat for now seems like the most reasonable choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480016/#Comment_480016" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-28T20:31:47+00:00" title="January 28, 2019  8:31PM">January 28</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2019 8:33PM by Paul_T.">edited January 28</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote">other thread.  But yeah, if you <i>had</i> been correct, and there had been plot constraints <i>beyond</i> the fictional constraints, then I agree that it's the exact same type of problem as "get the witch to Lindisfarne no matter what choices the characters make".</blockquote>\nThis is a difficult tack to take. From your perspective, sure, maybe you were 100% committed to respecting any decisions made by the players. (I'm not sure, though; if we had come up with some clever way of scaring the Heretics away, would you have eagerly embraced that, or - even at a subconscious level! - tried to sabotage our attempts, since that would spoil the cool "Witch saves them from a desperate situation" scene you were setting up?)<br/><br/>In any case, it doesn't matter, because what I'm talking about is my own personal experience of playing the character in that scene. Once it became clear to me that you were committed to pushing the fiction strongly in a particular direction, I could no longer play the character authentically, because, instead, I was painfully aware that the current events in play weren't truly open-ended, but served a particular agenda. This may be a shortcoming I have as a player (I've struggled with this in many/most freeform games I've ever played, which is why I often don't like them [*], so it's not just specific to this game and this experience), perhaps. I don't know. I can't really imagine not feeling this way, but maybe you don't! (Again, I'm talking about an inner/personal psychological experience, not making some truth claims for every player and about all roleplaying.)<br/><br/>So, for me, the common point is that I am finding it difficult to play purely from Actor Stance because I am aware that (in this case, another player's) fictional constraints limit the ways in which I can play my character. I could tell that you were pushing hard from a certain outcome, which meant we were no longer doing open-ended freeform collaborative "yes, and" improv roleplaying; instead, I had to conform to the constraints of the scene or run into a (social level) conflict with you.<br/><br/><br/>[*] : In fact, interestingly for this thread, I find plot constraints such as in <i>Witch</i> to be, perhaps paradoxically, freeing! Knowing that we're all on the same page about where things are headed makes it far easier for me to be comfortable playing the character, since I have a much better idea of what kinds of "moves" are available to me in the game before we run into a conflict of interests between the players.<br/><br/>The constraints here help, rather than hinder, me when it comes to freeform roleplaying.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480017/#Comment_480017" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-28T20:34:54+00:00" title="January 28, 2019  8:34PM">January 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (As a sidenote, I may have just explained the appeal of Emma's style of play to myself here, indirectly.

said something that was a downside of certain play structures for you that is so much part of the point of using some of those structures for my group and I. You talked about fictional constraints and stuff force you to play outside of Actor Stance, and make Actor Stance difficult for you, which is expressly part of the point for my group and I. We expressly avoid Actor Stance. We view Actor Stance as directly antithetical to what we want in play, but it's something that it's easy to accidentally fall into when you get into situations of Bleed (which, Bleed is something highly desirable for us), so we enjoy having mechanics specifically to pull us out of Actor Stance and back into the Author/Director hybrid that we want to be playing in. It's in a way like Bertolt Brecht's <i>verfremdungseffekt</i>. It specifically disallows us from falling into passive audience-like routines and puts us into a "writer's room" kind of space again, which is where our play thrives, and what our play is deeply based in. The sort of stories we want to tell can't be accomplished with a passive audience-like routine. They can only be properly told when we're engaged as authors, when we're all fully invested in our roles as dramaturges - as the authors of the fiction, not the characters in the fiction. <br/>(There's also the fact that "open-ended" and "improv" are not really terms we would use to describe our play at all. We're big believers in the idea that the more time we've had to plan and discuss and prepare and set up a scene, the better it's going to be, whereas if we just jump into it in a thoroughly improvisational and open-ended manner, it's not going to meet our quality standards as artists.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480029/#Comment_480029" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-29T23:19:56+00:00" title="January 29, 2019 11:19PM">January 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like that perspective, Emma, and the clarity with which you are presenting it. It's definitely worth thinking about!<br/><br/>When the "indie games" movement started to take form, I think this was a large part of the appeal for a lot of people: to create structures that force, free, or encourage us to think as authors and to make the games and the stories as potent and aesthetically well-formed as they could be.<br/><br/>In contrast, there is the traditional view of the roleplaying game as a "virtual experience", and the (often) unexamined assumption that this is always the ideal, the goal, and the dream.<br/><br/>Since the "indie games" movement passed (or became the new normal, depending how you want to look at it), people started to talk about and write games which somewhat consciously wanted to return to that older conception of roleplaying (I'm talking about everything from RPG.net to Apocalypse World to the OSR movement when I say this).<br/><br/>Your post here is a good reminder of how important that conscious authorship is to the quality of the games we are playing - at least for some of us, some of the time. I'll spend some time thinking about that.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>On a sidenote: I have a question for you about that, but it might be a distraction from this thread.

So we play GMless games like rotating GMed games, and only challenge the GMs authority in the rare instance the narrative disturbs our sense of versatilitude.<br/><br/>Also, we have all GMed games and played a lot of RPGs; so\u2014even though we can be perfectionists and can focus on any hiccups that happen during our session\u2014our stories and characters typically much more naturally coherent and well crafted than the other games I play in. I probably have the least GMing experience in our group and probably have the most moments of \u201cwriters block\u201d when we play; however, in the GMless games I play with other groups, with players who are less experienced at playing GMless games\u2014and wherein we play from the more typical GMless stance (where the story is told from the perspective of the current narrator\u2019s character and the scene is about their character\u2019s goals, like how one would play <b>Fiasco</b>)\u2014I\u2019m always the big idea person, and everyone else has \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d and it falls on me to weave together a coherent and properly structured story together. This is why, in this typical GMless style, there is a necessary focus on telling a good story as the main goal of the game.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, playing GMless game\u2019s from a rotating GM stance typically makes it simply easier to tell a naturally coherent story; the focus is on the outer world and environment and the actions of NPC, with each PC responding. Whereas, telling the story from the current narrator\u2019s perspective and focusing on pursuing that character\u2019s goals often involves summarizing background plot information and lots of improving of dialogue with less of the outer world and environment sketched out, and that leaves a lot of the story left to dialogue that can end up going many unexpected directions. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve described it properly, but basically in a GMless game everyone focuses on playing their particular character and persuading their character\u2019s given objective during their turn, and in a rotating GMed game players take the GMs stance on their turn. <br/><br/>We play in a different style than is typical when playing these games and this rotating GM style is very necessary to successfully make the main focus of the game be character exploration, rather than the focus being on the telling of a good story, as is usually the necessary focus and challenge when playing from the typical GMless stance.<br/><br/>Also, since we are all experienced players and most of us are experienced GMs (especially David), we are able to also create stories that typically have satisfying narrative arcs and so forth; especially, when we work together and can quickly overcome differences in creative directions\u2014BTW, I think that introducing the <i>\u201cHow about...\u201d</i> technique, which I outlined in the <b>Which:</b> thread\u2014perhaps with the addition of the <i>\u201cWhat other way could you see this scene playing out?\u201d</i> technique\u2014would really help speed things up and help to get everyone on the same page when we have trouble coming to a narrative consensus.<br/><br/>A final thought: I think we can sometimes pick our story\u2019s shortcomings to death\u2014which I would argue is an unhealthy impulse and ultimately defeatist. We should instead focus on the overwhelming interesting, creativive and frankly amazing stories we tell together. I think our <b>Dog Eat Dog</b> and <b>Sorcerer</b>   games were about as good as it gets; and our <b>Life with Master</b> game has been super interesting and full of creativity so far, David\u2019s character and the obsession the Master has with his inhuman, mechanical parts is beyond awesome.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480061/#Comment_480061" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-31T01:03:40+00:00" title="January 31, 2019  1:03AM">January 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>That's a very interesting perspective!

In essence, their scene is supposed to be about their character in some way, and their turn is when their character\u2019s supposed to be in the spotlight. So it\u2019s natural for people to play out their scene as if they are just playing their character, while also adding some minimum narrative details for context. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480071/#Comment_480071" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-31T05:55:56+00:00" title="January 31, 2019  5:55AM">January 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some nuggets about plot, setting and dialog regarding player perspective, <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480077/#Comment_480077" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-31T17:48:00+00:00" title="January 31, 2019  5:48PM">January 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a>,<br/><br/>I\u2019m not sure I know what you are specificity asking.

I have no idea what would happen if the game were picked up in a very different context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480172/#Comment_480172" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-05T19:38:37+00:00" title="February  5, 2019  7:38PM">February 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Dave.<br/><br/>I'm exactly on the same page as you.

I was thinking about the other <b>Witch: </b>thread when I said we can sometimes pick our stories apart, and I hadn\u2019t considered how the analysis, that we\u2019d been doing there, could be insightful in terms of game design. I don\u2019t know why I commented about it in this thread because it just confused things and didn\u2019t apply. <br/><br/>The design discussion in this thread has actually been super insightful. It\u2019s convinced me that I want the games I\u2019m currently working on to either have a GM or a Rotating GM format (because I think the GMless format\u2014as I\u2019ve defined it above\u2014can create unique difficulties for storytelling, and that the format only makes sense for a small portion of games). So even though there is a lot of unexplored creative space for design innovation in GMless games, that\u2019s no reason to try to fit a square peg in a round hole. I don\u2019t think I realized just how radically different these stances are from one another, and how much playing a GMless vs Rotating GM stance had effected the success of past sessions. <br/><br/>I also think the discussion you\u2019re having about separating the director\u2019s and actor\u2019s stance by  <i>framing towards an outcome</i> and then playing the scene in the actor\u2019s stance, is seriously worth thinking about. It is something I haven\u2019t given a lot of thought to or made a delineation between; I think the group, or at least I, try to do both of these things at once when playing in a GMless game. <br/><br/>I think by using your technique to make the process more explicit, it might help people more easily and naturally craft the story and make GMless games less slippery. It\u2019s a nuanced change though and I have to think about what it would actually do in game play. I think we should play test the idea and see how it works out. Sometimes by making things, that people do in play, more explicit, you can really make things more structured and the procedures can clarify things. I really interested in what the effects of this delineation would be, and whether they would be significantly and help ease of play and story construction. Anyway, it\u2019s got me curious and we should definitely try it out <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480179/#Comment_480179" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-05T21:01:03+00:00" title="February  5, 2019  9:01PM">February 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to experiment with that some more, too. It's a miniature technical distinction that could have some real impact on our various games.

I enjoy it myself in a lot of cases.  <br/><br/>But there are other games in which I much prefer to do all my character play in just actor stance, for a number of reasons.  In Witch, it's a sense of tackling the moral questions intuitively, from <i>within</i> the fiction, and <i>discovering</i> where that leads the characters (as opposed to including an element of <i>deciding</i> from <i>without</i>).  I know that's highly personal to me, and some people feel the same, and others feel totally differently; in the end, all I want is the <i>option</i> to do it my way.<br/><br/>So I agree with you that different configurations of GMing work for different games, and that even in games without one permanent GM, having one GM at any given moment might be useful.<br/><br/>In Within My Clutches, the GM role is held by the player who is playing their supervillain character, and then handed off to others at that player's discretion.  This system produces its own unique dynamic.  So I definitely think a lot of viable options are out there!<br/><br/>P.S. Your post format got messed up cuz you have a quote tag from yourself inside your quote tag from me.
