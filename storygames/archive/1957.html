                    I've knocked together a very early draft of TGRSWY!<br/><br/>I'd really appreciate some feedback. It's meant to be a light, comedy game which you can pretty much just pick up and play. <br/><br/><a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dd25fn8k_3nn6gcs" rel="nofollow">Have a look at the draft</a>, forgive the awful formatting and tell me what you think. Is everything clear? Are there any sections of the rules you'd like to throw away and replace with something different? Any suggested tweaks?<br/><br/>Any feedback is much appreciated and really needed.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            The chanting is <i>gold.  </i>That will be really fun in play.  I also like the freeform development of the target and his circumstances.  <br/><br/>I had a little dissonance when I got to the "anti-gay retinal scanners" mission impossible bits - isn't turning a Straight hard enough in the real world?  To harp on that theme, I could see real pathos emerging from play despite the comic overlay.  <br/><br/>Is there a reason you couldn't have GM currency instead of the arbitrary assignation of difficulty numbers?<br/><br/>The skill <i>Cosmetics </i>seems more like it should be named <i>Drag</i>.                        </div>

                            This is very cool, although I haven't taken time to really digest how the rummy elements will turn out (but I love playing gin, so I can see it being up my alley).<br/><br/>I suggest <b>Muscles </b>rather than <b>Strength</b>, as in â€˜Muscle Maryâ€™.                        </div>

                            Hold on, let me get my asbestos raincoat.<br/><br/>Despite the giant thread recently about how this place is too nice, I'm going to try to be nice about this.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a bad game to make. It strikes me as being quite similar to a game about turning lesbians straight by having sex with them. (Please god let there <b>not</b> actually be such a game.) <br/><br/>Have you ever seen the movie The Birdcage? It's not a terrible movie. Its big message is "Look, them gay fellers there are people too," but it does it by exploiting every stereotype it can find on both sides. It has its touching moments and its hilarious ones, but it's also eyeballs deep in hypocrisy, and to say that it actually changed anyone's opinions of either side is probably a stretch. If anything, I think it serves to reinforce them.<br/><br/>This game is an amusing running gag. If you're going to take it past the running gag phase... I'm not sure I'd feel ok seeing this book on store shelves.                        </div>

                            Graham, <br/><br/>my first impression is that, given the subject, this should be a <b>non-light</b> comedy game. It should be satirical or biting or bittersweet or something in addition to funny. I would want to see either it pushed over the top to full satire, which may be the intent.<br/><br/>Or take away the literal recruitment squad and make it about gender and awkwardness and 'recruitment.' It could still be based on a spy mission structure, but more like a personal plan of attack with all the pitfalls rather than sensors and straight bouncers. <br/><br/>Those would be my two meta preferences up front.                        </div>

<p>Indigo?</p>
<p>You want <em>indigo</em> in the flag?</p>
<p>Fucking faggot.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Good luck making this "light" humor. You can't (and I don't mean "shouldn't") make light of something people care about. No, this is going to be hard-hitting, affecting humor.</p>
<p>I really don't like that the GM sets an arbitrary difficulty. I propose that, if you're going to keep it that way, you make the rewards consistent with the challenge, perhaps giving bonus cards for the next round or some such reward (since this is a reward the winner/punish the loser kind of system). Maybe you get to keep those cards in a separate pool of cards. Let's call it your "Moustache". You can use those cards whenever you like. They're known only to you (just like your real hair color, sister! Oh, snap!) and you can draw them out when you need to win.</p>
<p>Also, it's easier to turn people gay than it is to get past a bouncer. It seems like the way to succeed is by turning people gay all the time. I think that's great.</p>

<p>Also, Graham: Colin's wrong. There's no reason not to make a game with this subject matter. There's every reason <em>to</em> do so. It's funny. It's topical. That said, if it's going to hurt anyone, it will be Fundies and homosexuals. I think you win if Fundies get mad about it. Not so much if your gay friends stop talking to you.</p>
<p>Since you brought it up, I think it's kosher to ask: are you gay? Because this strikes me a little bit like a minstrel show. And, like a minstrel show, it <a href="http://www.bamboozledmovie.com/" rel="nofollow">can be used for pointed political commentary</a>. Make your biting statements with care. Humor is serious business. I know at least one gay man on this board and I'd really want to know his perspective. I mean, this <em>is</em> a bit like making a game about Jewish Conspirators, and if I were making such a game, I'd want to make sure it was funny to Jews (pretty easy for me to check in that case).</p>

I'm all for pissing off fundamentalist religious folks, but I'd rather do it with something that wouldn't get me fucked from both sides.<br/><br/>No pun intended. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here's a scenario: You're a new gamer. You're hanging out with a bunch of people you barely know. Someone brings in this game and everyone there laughs their ass off about it, because they know each other and can joke around like that. You? You can't tell if they're serious or not. What would you do? I'd be awful uncomfortable, and I hope I'd have the guts to say something about it.<br/><br/>The difference between "kill all the orcs because they're evil" and "kill all the black folk because they're evil" is the ability to tell fantasy from reality, and from what I can tell everyone here has that.

I haven't got time to respond fully right now (dinner's ready), but please do keep comments coming.<br/><br/>One thing, though: could we steer clear of questions over whether I should write this game?

                            I'll join the chorus in terms of thinking that this should be more biting satire and less Benny Hill.  And that part of that would be too yank the Mission Impossible/World of Darkness vibe.  There's something much more interesting about treating day to day sexual politics like a spy movie than mixing homosexual screening technology in.<br/><br/>Love the chant rules.  Love them!<br/><br/>The rummy resolution seems a little off, though.  Part of it is the dual difficulties - the set the GM lays and the arbitrary difficulty number - and I wonder about why the GM is laying sets in the first place.  As players we can't influence his hand at all, and it may get very difficult to out-play the GM.  <br/><br/>Hard and fast suggestions:  The GM starts with his 6+players cards.  When you come up to a challenge, draw a card blind from the GM's hand and lay your set face down.  The GM can lay his set whenever he wants - earlier he has less of an idea about matching set to difficulty, but later he might not have the cards.  Once everyone has laid their sets, there's a showdown.  Right after revealing cards but just before resolving the situation, team spirit can come into play.  Sets that beat the GM win.  <br/><br/>Perhaps a rule for single card sets - a penalty, perhaps?  And special cases that allow further draws.  Both of those notions are probably the result of recently learning Canasta.                        </div>

<blockquote>Here's a scenario: You're a new gamer. You're hanging out with a bunch of people you barely know. Someone brings in this game and everyone there laughs their ass off about it, because they know each other and can joke around like that. You? You can't tell if they're serious or not. What would you do? I'd be awful uncomfortable, and I hope I'd have the guts to say something about it.<br/><br/>The difference between "kill all the orcs because they're evil" and "kill all the black folk because they're evil" is the ability to tell fantasy from reality, and from what I can tell everyone here has that. Just... this really bothers me. Please, think for a few minutes about someone playing the other side in this game: playing the straights with baseball bats.<br/><br/>Man, I sound whiney. I believe it, though. </blockquote>
First, the top paragraph: I would NEVER pull out this game with a group if I didn't (a.) know them well, and (b.) know that they are comfortable discussing sexuality. For the same reason that I wouldn't pull out Sorcerer and say "humanity is addiction" with a new group unless they'd specifically signed up to play Sorcerer or other "moral dilemma" games.<br/><br/>I know the people in my group really well, and we've talked about sexuality some, and I feel that we could pull this out, laugh at the world, and the people in our group, queer and straight, would <i>get</i> what we were doing.<br/><br/>To respond to your second paragraph: The Sorcerer game I'm playing in right now, my kicker scene was where my character (who's coping with his sexuality) gets called a "fag" by a guy on his track team, and shoves the guy's face into a mirror. The issue was very much queer alienation -- that's what the scene was about. It's a far cry from ANYTHING in tGRSWY, but to respond to your comments, I disagree that fantasy and reality need to be so aggressively shoved apart. What IS needed is to be AWARE of what is fantasy and what is reality. When we did that scene, there was a lot of reality in it for me (being alienated as a queer kid in high school, feeling the need to puff chests with team mates, stifled voices), but I was clear about what was real and what was fantasy (the violence, the demons, and the revenge were all parts of the game that were NOT REAL for me. They were fantasy.)<br/><br/>I think that although tGRSWY is a silly joke game, it doesn't necessarily/intrinsically devalue gay or straight people. There is the potential for damage there, but so long as players/readers distinguish fantasy and reality, and have a foundation for approaching such a game, I think that your worries and concerns are unnecessary.<br/><br/>I say this as a queer* male myself.<br/><br/>................<br/>*queer in a straight relationship                        </div>

                            Ah, excellent question, George. The lesbians are a sort of mistrusted ally: a bit like the way the British Secret Service thinks about the CIA.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for the feedback. I hardly know where to start. <br/><br/>Joe, thanks for your post, it's made me think; Joshua, since you ask, I'm straight. Chris, I do appreciate your comments, although I don't really want to take the discussion down that route.<br/><br/>The rummy suggestions are useful. I think I've made a mistake with having <i>both</i> a difficulty number <i>and</i> a hand for the GM. And I've given the GM too many cards. And Judson's right that I need a rule for single cards. I'll need to think again about that.<br/><br/>What I'm really interested in, and undecided about, is whether to darken the humour. The original idea of the setting is that every gay or straight cliche is true: gay men really do recruit; straight men really can be turned gay after a couple of beers; you really can recognise gay men by looking at them. All this made a world <i>so</i> ridiculous that I felt it could only be treated as a cartoon. <br/><br/>What would be the satire option? It's a society, similar to ours, where straights and gays are segregated; where straights aggressively defend their territory; gay men are probably ghettoised, if you want it really dark; and where gays react to the segregation by proving to the straights that they're not as straight as they think they are. If anyone does have any suggestions about how to do the satire angle, do let me have them, because I'm not sure about it.<br/><br/>It's interesting. It would be a massive change in the game: I couldn't have groups called "Pink Fist" and "Rainbow Warriors". <br/><br/>Perhaps there's a sort of Paranoia-esque or Judge Dredd-ish middle ground. That's the sort of territory I'd like to aim for. And there might also be a dial option too: the group decides whether it wants cartoon or satirical.<br/><br/>Any suggestions are very welcome.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            An easy way to go about it would be to add straight stereotypes: straights are always fundamentally religious when sober, overly paranoid about whether or not they're being "checked out" by a member of the same sex, etc.                        </div>

                            Interestingly, a game called "The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!" makes me think, "Oh, that's amusing. Let me be sure never to play that."<br/><br/>If the exact same game was called "Rainbow Warriors," for some reason it appeals more. Like suddenly it just became some tripped-out civil rights adventure.<br/><br/>No, scratch that. The tongue-in-cheekness about stereotypes probably makes it less threatening and easier to swallow. (Hmm. I feel dirty using that last expression in the current context.)<br/><br/>Also, "World of Straightness" makes me laugh.<br/><br/>I'd consider replacing the poker chips with a more amusingly hetero item.

                            I'm kinda sorry you deleted that post, Joe, it sounded like fun.<br/><br/>Carl, you're absolutely right about the straight stereotypes. The basic idea is that <i>all</i> the stereotypes, gay and straight, are true, and perhaps I haven't made that clear enough. So, yes, the Straights are stupidly paranoid about gay men watching them.<br/><br/>And, also, all the other straight paranoias are true: watching men's diving <i>actually does mean you're turning gay</i>; wearing nice clothes <i>will turn you gay</i>; if you can't think of anything to say to a beautiful woman, <i>you're gay</i>.<br/><br/>Larry, man, I can't change the title. Really. Everyone remembers that title. Good idea about making the Straightness indicator more hetero. Maybe I need to start with something which actually is straight and which you bend to indicate gayness.<br/><br/>Ben, you echoed my own thoughts about the satire thing. The discussion about satire has been useful: it's made me realise that that's not what I want. <br/><br/>Oh, sure, you could make this a poignant game, set in an alternate London where the homosexuals are ghettoized and we really feel for the Straights and so on and so on. I worked out the whole thing on a train journey yesterday. And, God, was it dull.<br/><br/>What's far more fun, I think, is to treat it is parody. South Park is a good model here: the way it tackles <i>every</i> offensive subject, in <i>no depth whatsoever</i>, portrays <i>everything</i> in stereotypes, and you can't get offended because it's disrespectful towards <i>everyone</i>. That's what I want to aim for.<br/><br/>What else? I do agree that the setting needs to be closer to the real world. In fact, I quite like the idea of straight players invading real-life settings they frequent (but not, I think, recruiting people they know).<br/><br/>Oh, I should add that, over on <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/forum" rel="nofollow">Collective Endeavour</a>, Joe Prince told me I should drop the rummy mechanic. I think he's right. It's a cute mechanic, but requires too much thought for this game. Earlier, I'd considered a Snap mechanic, and I'll go back to thinking about that.<br/><br/>Thanks very much: this has been a very useful thread for me. If anyone has any final thoughts, do post them.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

As a final cry for a straighter play on the concept, I didn't realize that I was thinking about the South Park concept until you brought it up.  I'd suggest a world like our own except that the stereotypes are <em>never questioned.</em>  There aren't CCTV systems that draw reticules labeled "FAG," there aren't homosexual ghettos, either.  But everyone does cleave to the ideas behind the stereotypes - and any attempt to extrapolate from "everyone in this world believe without question that gay men talk with a lisp and love show tunes" to governmental profiling programs is an error.  And that really is the South Park formula: until Stan says "you know, I learned something today," everyone sticks to the most absolute, goofy ideology.<br/><br/>Because South Park, from time to time, will spark interesting conversation.  But Bugs Bunny in a dress is just Looney Tunes.                        </div>

Now <i>that's</i> hilarious. Unfortunately, everything I can think of here (bendy straws, cheap silverware) doesn't really bend in a metered fashion necessary to the game mechanics.<br/><br/>Please retain "World of Straightness." The nod to White Wolf is too good.<br/><br/>Is there any plan at this point to publish this thing, you know, on dead trees? The title suggests the pretty obvious gag for cover art, the WWI recruitment poster, but with a <i>fabulous!</i> man standing in for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kitchener_Wants_You" rel="nofollow">Lord Kitchener</a>/Uncle Sam.                        </div>

Are you saying the queer community isn't already ghettoized? Because, a lot of the "queer-friendly" neighbourhoods in cities do get very ghettoized, already. Just sayin'.                        </div>

<p>I think the Gay Ghetto is like Toontown in <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</em> Like, rainbows in the sky, thumping background music and a gay pride parade going all the time.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>Maybe I need to start with something which actually is straight and which you bend to indicate gayness.</blockquote>
Straightness or gayness is represented by a paperclip. Straighten it out at the beginning of the game, and progressively bend it as gayness increases. (I realize that you can't get the paperclip completely straight, but if you act really macho, maybe nobody wil notice. If they do, start a fight with them.)                        </div>

                            Announcer Voice: "It was in 2010, and the military in the former Soviet Union was having a parade, displaying it's awesome arsenal of conquest. On display was a Cold War relic that saw  no use: a device that came to be known as "The Gayzer." It's inventor, renowned Soviet physicist Gregor Sunovabitch, was on display with his invention, and, in a moment that remade history, was asked to display it's terrifying capabilities to the current Soviet head of state, Rotmai Kokkoff."<br/>
<br/>
"The device operated on a quantum level, and used immense amounts of vodka to intoxicate quantum particles, to the extent that they functioned in a manner thay would never consider doing in a more sober state. Unfortunately, Soviet brilliance in technology was again married to the Soviet tendency to skimp on shielding. Upon activation, the parade was bathed in all the colors of the rainbow. Almost instantly, the military parade became a Pride parade, and here in this rarely seen footage, the Soviet flag, formerly a majestic red and yellow, becomes pink, and the hammer and sickle transform into two men performing unnatural acts with each other. If you listen carefully, the military music, so firm, patriotic, and virile, gives way to a pulsating rythm, and a pronounced bassline."<br/>
<br/>
"The particles generated by this machine, hereafter referred to as <i>fabulons</i>, were thought to be contained in the Soviet Union, but instead quickly induced fallout across the globe. Now, what formerly a minority lifelstyle has become almost the norm, with the popular news media adamantly refusing, even promoting in some cases, the view that nothing has changed. But make no mistake! The silent gay/lesbian majority, and their activist branches The Gay Recruitment Squad, want YOU! Will you do your part, virile patriotic straight male, in continuing to propagate the species, and thwart the silent Pink menace? This ten-part series will show you how to maintain your heterosexuality despite fabulon contamination!"<br/>
<br/>
"Part One: What is Heterosexuality?"<br/>
<br/>
"Heterosexuality, as it was, was easy to understand, as it used to be an accepted and promoted part of culture in every society. We once could be assured that children would, without unnecessary encouragement, adopt a heterosexual lifelstyle and continue to procreate as God intended. As it has become more difficult in recent years to find examples of heterosexuality that are not compromised or used for purposes of parody, we have compiled a handy list of male heterosexual behaviors that will ward off, albeit temporarily, fabulon contamination. These have been skillfully culled from the pronouncedly heterosexual artists, such as Orson Scott Card, Frank Miller, Dean Koontz, Norman Mailer, and painter Norman Rockwell, as well as the films of John Wayne and various military films. We will continue to update this series with further examples of heterosexual masculinity, to provide a proper guide for you, the straight male."<br/>
<br/>
"1) When adjourning to the men's room to "drain the dragon," be <i>certain</i> to use the urinal unless absolutely necessary. Do NOT initiate conversation. Stare straight ahead. Avoid the temptation to glance at the private parts of other men. If you feel you are being "scoped", threaten violence. Masculine violence confuses and frightens fabulons and those infected by them. Be prepared to use force by any means necessary. Do not back down unless you are sure the opponent is a heterosexual like yourself who simply made an honest, if regrettable, mistake. Above all else, DO NOT allow another man access to your buttocks or genitals: that will make you a target for fabulon infection. Even women should not be allowed access to those areas without a witty, masculine remark. Establishing your heterosexuality will force the fabulons to search elsewhere for a less virile specimen to contaminate."<br/>
<br/>
2) "Do not consume too much alcohol. Too much alcohol or other drugs will weaken your defense system, and leave you vulnerable to the effects of free-floating fabulons. In this scene, we witness the unfortunate effects of alcohol combining with fabulon infestation."<br/>
<br/>
(Two drunk guys. One turns to the other. "I...I...love you, maaan." First man vomits on shoes of second man.)<br/>
<br/>
"As you can see the courtship ritual has begun. DON"T let this happen to you! Know your limits! Especially, do NOT smoke or otherwise ingest marijuana. While it does not leave you vulnerable to fabulon contamination, it marks you as an object of scorn among homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. No one likes a filthy hippie."<br/>
<br/>
"3) Forget such unmanly prusuits as hygiene, grooming, art appreciation, and education. Develop opinions before you learn facts--AND STICK TO THOSE OPINIONS, threatening violence if necessary. Forgo bathing until necessary. Shave intermittently, or grow a beard. Do trim your nails, or better yet, use them as often as possible so that they break often and remain jagged. Revel in your natural body odor, and forgo deodorant, unless it has been approved as hetero- friendly. Your aura of ignorance and body filth must be maintained to resist fabulon penetration. Be strong, in all senses of the word."<br/>
<br/>
"4) Indulge in the sexual conquest of women, as many as possible, and avoid settling down. Be yourself, and avoid the temptation to "clean up" to further your conquest record. Do NOT become too emotionally involved: While romance is wonderful, in these perilous times, it become a vector of infection. If the woman truly appreciates your virile, masculine nature, she will understand."                        </div>

                            "5) Keep conversation as minimal as possible, speaking in monosyllables is preferred."<br/>

Guy One: "Yo."<br/>
Guy Two: *grunts*<br/>
Guy Three: *nods*<br/>
Guy Four: *brief wave*<br/>
Guy Five: "Fuggoff."<br/>

"This is considered an appropriate conversation among straight males. Lace your conversation with sports metaphors, military metaphors, and profanity. Embrace the utility of the word "fuck." Notice how the word "shit" can substitute for any noun, when taken in context. Your language may be regarded as "colorful" to some overly-sensitive types, but it's not all the colors of the rainbow!"<br/>
<br/>
"6) Gather a tight group of straight male peeers around you when engaging in a beer-fest, or a booty-call. Peer pressure will help prevent fabulon infection. Although a group of males is dangerous to be around in case of fabulon contamination, true friends are willing to "beat the shit" out of an infected friend rather than let him suffer the results of contamination. Also, learn ethnic and sexual jokes, the more offensive the better. Smoke cigarettes and cigars. Develop a gun collection. Express anger fluently, keep all other emotions bottled up until they become anger."<br/>
<br/>
"7) Resent authority. You are a MAN, dammit, and you are your own boss. Retaliate against those in authority, particularly if they are female. The more over-the-top and juvenile, the better. Remember, you are fighting for the future of your species. Set a manly, virile example for future generations."                        </div>

For mechanics, I think a set of skills and stats, plus a Heterometer. For each "manly" act you do, it goes up. But push it too high, you go all the way around into hypermasculine, and become heterosexual. Thus, the median is where you want to stay. So, how long can you stay in that safe middle, when each choice is frought with Pink peril?<br/>
<br/>
Or am I off-base, and we're recruiting the Hets for conversion? I find this way more amusing, because it's funny to me how many stupid contortions a hetero guy will go through to avoid being labeled as gay.                        </div>

                            but other than losing an objective(turning someone gay) what's at threat for the characters?  i just thought that the straight liberation front would be a good antagonist, but it's not my game.  i mean if you're gonna base a game off of exaggerating myth, there's a big myth that says that being gay is curable.  heck if it's genetic, maybe it is?  <br>you'd think if the whole object of the game is to turn people gay, there would be different degrees of difficulty.  like turning a male florist gay, may be easier than a construction worker.  to once again make crazy broad stereotypes, but i'm thinking that's what drives this.<br>just one man's opinion, who has too much time on his hands.                        </br></br></div>

                            All right. Let's see.<br><br>Judson, I'm really interested in your stuff about South Park, but I can't quite get my head around it. See, when I think of South Park, I see people actually embodying the stereotypes. I see Big Gay Al and "Operation Get Behind The Darkies". How do you see a more serious tone in South Park?

Perfect. Yes, me and Malcolm Craig were having the same conversation.

The idea does make some sense: it gives the Squad something to lose. And it creates some rather nice reverse-comedy with the Squad experiencing conversion for themselves:

But, honestly, I'm not sure either way.<br/><br/>Nate, thanks very much: those are great ideas. I'm stealing most of those: and you're right that there should be missions <i>apart</i> from turning people gay.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
I didn't read the article before I posted. I find coming at it from the other direction (pun NOT intended) more humorous for me. I feel comfortable mocking the excesses of straight males because I am one, and sometimes familiarity breeds contempt. A balance between the two, with an eye for detail and no remorse for either, sounds a lot like the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
I also have some ideas for "exorcising" fabulons, and a "manly method" for justifying sleeping with many women, if you're interested! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Graham, the nice thing about paperclips is that there's a wonderful degree of subjectivity ("if you succeed, bend his paperclip a little"), and you can easily compare to see who is more bent.  That really is a great idea.                        </div>

                            I guess it depends on how Graham incorporates it into the game, but I think you really, really want to get them bent, you know?  And it isn't that hard - you have a straightened out paper clip, you hold it in the middle and bend it some.  You don't have to turn it back into a paper clip, just create an angle.  The further from straight, the gayer the character.                        </div>

                            I suppose you could try to bend the paperclip into a triangle, though the joke might not be immediately apparent without coated pink paperclips. (Which, really, are harder to track down than generic "paperclips", and would prevent the use of paperclip color as a differentiator between players...)                        </div>
