I love the event structure and I'm looking forward to running the game when it's released. It feels like it may address some of my favorite design goals. Anyway i'm happy to see something interesting being done with a high profile license. I'm really hoping it will reach marvel fans.<br/><br/>Everything I hear about DnD 5 kind of upsets me in an odd way. In such a small industry i'm kind of tired of seeing resources thrown in the wrong direction. At first I thought the designers did not understand the what the actual problems were. but then I read this kind of stuff in jenscot's "What can D&amp;D 5E mean for Indie Games?" discussion<br/><br/>"And yet another different D&amp;D freelancer friend said: <br/><br/>"This is why D&amp;D 4E is called an indie game. It tells you how to play. Many of us know that the rules are better than they have ever been design wise but that's not the point. Look at Iron Heroes designed by Mike Mearls. The same people who loved that game, a game which was similar to 4E in many ways, hated 4E. Why? They actually like the rules in many cases. But they don't want to be told this is the way to play. These games are about people. They are about friends. And you don't know my friends better than I do.""<br/><br/>So I'm starting to see how the problems of DnD are a little intractable with a vocal portion of the audience. I think pathfinder's success clearly shows that a portion of the purchasing audience agrees. <br/><br/>But I sort of think they still don't understand the hart of what is wrong. I have this feeling that DnD 4 failed both the old audience and failed to fully grasp a new audience. It was something that worked for such a tiny sliver of people because it had contradictory goals. <br/><br/>Trying to attract a wide audience does not quite mesh with pushing a hard core monthly content subscription that needs a printer (with ink) to play the game. Requiring the audience to source printing is the sort of low rent thing<i> I </i>would do. Same thing with character creation and session prep, really why do people think it's ok to require a computer for these tasks? They knew what their sales figures were compared to their online traffic.<br/><br/>Now they must go back to leaning on "great GM advice" and train an army of people the incredibly difficult task of game design instead of trying to sell them a finished product? What about that audience they wanted to reach with the new red box? Was that only worth one try? Was the same method that worked in the 80's really the best approach?<br/><br/>So let me go back to why i'm sort of excited for marvel. i'm hoping it will be a finished product. That I can get those events and play them without the prep, without the pain, of typical rpg. That maybe marvel will be what redbox was not. I don't know if that is the truth, if i'm hoping too much but that is my hope.<br/><br/>Honestly I don't know what to expect from DnD 5 and until I read it I should probably shut up and get a life.<br/><br/>also what is fantasy flight going to do with star wars!?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356701/#Comment_356701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T06:47:04+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  6:47AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2012 7:52AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>Same thing with character creation and session prep, really why do people think it's ok to require a computer for these tasks?

The games never stopped working for you because you were willing to put in the effort. I think there is a much larger audience of people who are not willing to put in that effort. In fact burn out due to effort is probably the number 1 factor that leads people to drop rpgs, not being able to design a fun game is second so your probably willing to put in the effort and skilled enough to get the job done. <br/><br/>Lets talk about character creation. In every gaming population there are the minority of people who buy and facilitate games and then there is the majority of people who just play in those games. The online character creator is something required of every player but is the sort of thing only the person who buys and facilitates would get into. so it's a tool aimed at the players but is really ill suited for the  audience. it worked - but only for a limited selection of people.<br/><br/>and when that did not work they went back to the red box. why not try something new? why not try again?<br/><br/>is that what 5e is? i don't expect it to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356728/#Comment_356728" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T09:48:19+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  9:48AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I heard Mike Mearls played in a pre-launch game of Marvel that Dave Chalker ran at D&amp;D Experience.

I am that buyer and facilitator, i am the nerd who prints out and constructs the paper craft terrain.<br/><br/>For a poorly formatted and presented game a computer aid is totally preferable. I used Army Builder for 40k and loved it! it's so much easier to build a 40k list with army builder than with paper. But then I played a miniatures game with a rational and well formatted army construction method and learned that there are far better ways to solve format and communication problems than resorting to a computer program to get the task done.<br/><br/>So when i say "why not try something new", i mean you can accomplish the same goals but with better methods.<br/><br/>I get it, i'm a dreamer and you are a "reality" sort of guy. what are these better methods?<br/><br/>check these out<br/>here is a character sheet <br/><a href="http://tylertinsley.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/swsechars2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Star wars saga edition sheet</a><br/>Here are some cards that create a matching set.<br/><a href="http://tylertinsley.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/card-preview-public.pdf" rel="nofollow">star wars saga edition cards</a><br/>The cards plug into that character sheet and a GM encounter sheet, thus labeling all the information on the card. For character creation the card feeds information into the sheet.<br/><br/>If I finished that set of cards and made all the character class cards, species cards, and talent tree cards. Players could build a saga edition character in under a minute. The bodyguard character card is an npc stat block and can be read using the GM encounter sheet. Overall this component based presentation entirely streamlines dealing with the rules in saga edition. It goes further than that. the product format draws every player at the table into buying cards for their character. plays well/sells well, a reasonable modern RPG format.<br/><br/>Those cards are just a retrofit and just a tiny part of the whole solution so they look a little ugly.<br/><br/>I have been saying that the book presentation does not work, books do not have enough bandwidth to make a complete role playing game possible.<br/><br/>What we see in games like D20 is part of the puzzle, what we see in games like fiasco is another part of the same puzzle. The thing is a book does not have the bandwidth to do both, it barely has enough for a game like fiasco.<br/><br/>When I say try something new I do not mean writing great gm advice. It does not mean capitulating to the malformed psychologies and social structures that develop around rpg groups. when i say it's not working it's because people stop playing for a reason dammit! Not everyone chooses to bend their entire life to fit these games.<br/><br/>If you are a DnD player, it really sucks if you have 7 close friends. let's solve that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356838/#Comment_356838" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T21:08:18+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  9:08PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That whole thing with the plug in cards?

A subscriber count from the WotC forums shows Wizards got revenues at least $400,000 last month <i>just from DDI.</i>  Now the subscriber count is not a perfect indicator - it shows people who have been subscribed forever, as well as people who are just "dipping in" this month, updating their offline character creator, etc.  Let's say that $400,000 number is inflated by 1/3, really what they can expect is around $300,000 a month.  Around $3.9 million <i>a year</i>. To put that in perspective, they would have to sell more than 100,000 <i>more</i> $34.95 books (or whatever) a year just to catch up to the revenues.<br/><br/>Have fun dreamin;, I encourage it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357105/#Comment_357105" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T21:12:29+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  9:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            that is some neat info on DDI.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
