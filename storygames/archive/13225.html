I know how to play D+D but when I looked at it from the lens of a novice trying to figure out how to play I found the book baffling. Page after page of text on subjects with tables and pictures and nothing that said "When you play do this..." It read like a hodge podge of rules. I know it is a joke parody of AD+D so I didn't think much of it. But when I looked at my 3E Player's Handbook I was also flooded with text (but also more understandable rules). The old White Box D+D (that I started playing in the 70's) wasn't much better. There is one and a half pages that show a dialogue between the referee and the caller. <br/><br/>I work so hard to explain just how to play my game that it boggles the imagination that so many successful games don't. The only way a person could learn how to play them is to be shown. I wonder if Indie RPGs have that problem. I know that though I've written rules as simply as I can that has always been a weakness of my games. <br/><br/>I guess what I'm interested in is what people's takes on other games are. What games fail to tell how to play. Which ones work and why? Please approach it from the point of view of a novice reading the game rather than being shown how to play by a GM.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297641/#Comment_297641" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T11:52:42+00:00" title="October 20, 2010 11:52AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Penny for my Thoughts does the best job of explaining how to play it that I have ever read &amp; played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297644/#Comment_297644" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T11:59:51+00:00" title="October 20, 2010 11:59AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris, I think some people would see your bug as a feature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297648/#Comment_297648" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T12:09:11+00:00" title="October 20, 2010 12:09PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been GMing DITV recently, and I was pretty surprised at what procedures weren't spelled out in the game. There's not much discussion about how to determine when a conflict has started, and also not much guidance given for what valid stakes are. The situation generation, which seems widely praised, is also very wishy-washy in the rules as presented:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dogs in the Vineyard</cite><br/>1C: If the situation seems grabby enough to you, which it probably won't, but if it does, you can stop. ...<br/>2D: If you've got enough NPCs to keep the PCs busy and you're happy with the situations, you can stop. ...<br/>3D: If you've taken the situation as far as you want to, you can stop. ...<br/>4D: If you're happy with the situation, you can stop. ...<br/>5B: Stop now, or repeat 5a until the situation is grabby enough for you.<br/></blockquote>\nSo, if you don't already know how to make a grabby DITV situation, it's pretty hard to learn how to make a grabby DITV situation by reading the rules. As Jason said, maybe this is supposed to be a feature rather than a bug, but I found it frustrating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297654/#Comment_297654" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T12:26:26+00:00" title="October 20, 2010 12:26PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan,<br/><br/>That's pretty interesting since I consider Dogs in the Vineyard one the better texts in this area.  I personally kind of have a minimum bar for such things.  My minimum bar is basically a clear instruction on each player's roles and goals.  For example Burning Empires hits the minimum bar because it tells the Game Master (a) he should play to win the Infection mechanic and (b) his fictional contributions should challenge the PC's Beliefs.  HOWEVER, it doesn't tell you HOW to do either of those things.  There are few if any strategy tips for the Infection and there is ZERO discussion on crafting situations that challenge a PC's Beliefs.    The reason that I don't fault the text for the latter omissions is because those are the RPG equivalent of strategy guides for board games.  A board game tells its procedures and what the goal of the game is but rarely, if ever, goes out of its way to give you pointers on what the most effective way to do that is.  That's left up to actual discovery through play and practice.  I'm fine with that.<br/><br/>So Dogs in the Vineyard tells you to (a) prep a town and gives you a process and (b) tells you to play the town and (c) tells you not to play God.  That meets my minimum bar.  It's pretty amazing how many games DON'T meet that minimum bar.  Diaspora being a recent example of a text that doesn't meet my minimum bar.<br/><br/>I can talk about going beyond the minimum bar especially for GM-prep/play heavy narrative games like Dogs in the Vineyard and Sorcerer but I don't want to derail the thread.

If I don't know what "grabby enough" means, then I can't perform the procedure that the book tells me to follow. Similarly, if my group doesn't have a good innate sense of what would make for good conflicts then we're not going to have good conflicts. I agree that other games are worse, I was just surprised that this particular procedure was so light since it's so widely praised as an example of good situation-generation procedure. To my mind the game could easily be made much better if the procedures were more explicit, but I suspect that Vincent includes the vagueness as a didactic element in his designs. I've sort of figured it out after a few sessions, but we had to play through a few crappy towns to get here, and that's a pretty steep price to pay when game time is such a scarce resource.<br/><br/>I'd also be interested in the other thread you proposed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297680/#Comment_297680" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T14:07:46+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  2:07PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2010 2:08PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HANDHOLDING, a short play:<br/><br/><br/>Vincent: I think noir-style detective stories are really exciting.<br/><br/>Dan: Me too!

There are also some places where the rules are a bit thin for my taste (I'd prefer more skills to have explicit factor listings, and for there to be more discussion about how to actually use weather in play) and some things that have more nuance in practice than I realized when reading the rules (picking good goals for conflicts is non-trivial, as is using conflicts on the GM's turn since players pick their own goal and can lose conflicts). I think it could probably also benefit from some more explicit advice on player strategy, since I've seen people have lackluster experiences because of lack of system mastery (e.g. trying too hard to win on virtually impossible rolls, thus wasting their resources and not even earning any checks in the process).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Specific procedures are of limited use when dealing with matters of taste.</blockquote>\nThis is true, but saying that some situations work better than others doesn't mean that there should be no guidance for what works well. Telling me to create "enough" NPCs isn't very effective if I don't know the system well enough to have an informed preference for how many NPCs in enough -- which is where I'll likely be if I'm in the position of a first time player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297705/#Comment_297705" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T18:23:37+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  6:23PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan,<br/><br/>Mouse Guard's an interesting case because I've gathered from listening to interviews and reading Luke's responses on the forums that Luke is the kind of designer who strives to hit what I call my minimum bar and then *purposefully* not go any further believing that play and more importantly *repeated* play is the best teacher for those things.<br/><br/>A number of times I've seen an exchange on the forums that looks like this:<br/><br/>Them: How do...?<br/>Luke: Have you played yet?<br/>Them: No.<br/>Luke: Do so, then ask again with context.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297712/#Comment_297712" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T20:29:18+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  8:29PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over on the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13218&amp;page=1#Item_13" rel="nofollow">Roleplaying Rewards</a> thread, somebody linked to a really interesting video about incentives given by an economist. He talked about 3 factors that go into people being satisfied with their endeavors, and one of those things was "mastery". In other words, people like getting good at stuff that they find meaningful (like playing guitar, or knitting, or whatever). I think certain RPG designs purposely reward/encourage a pursuit of 'mastery' (hell, Gary Gygax wrote a book about it), and that in these instances, the approach Jesse attributes to Luke makes a lot of sense. If that's the case with a game, figuring out how it works is part of the pleasure (as with the comparison given earlier about board games and strategy games). <br/><br/>I think this is all great stuff! But. With RPGs, you have the issue that sometimes 'lack of mastery' can make the game fall flat when everyone involved is a novice player, since so much of what goes on in the game is always necessarily left to the group (that's kind of the whole point, right?). For my personal preference, I like things that expect and require some agency on my part, some 'figuring it out' being necessary and so forth, but some strong procedural structures pointing in the right direction are awfully nice (so, yeah, I like the Dog's town creation system a lot, and I love the AW MCing rules). <br/><br/><br/>But, um, to get away from that long semi-digression and go back to the OP, much as I loved it, Teenagers from Outerspace kind of said "here's rules to make some goofy alien/human teenagers - do wacky things!"

Which ones work and why? </blockquote>\nHi Chris,<br/><br/>I didn't know <i>how to play</i> indie games* until last year, so I can tell you explicitly the games I had trouble understanding:<br/><br/>+ PTA -&gt; I had had no idea, from the book, about when a group was prescribing too much story, and how to bring conflict into a scene.<br/>+ IaWA -&gt; I had no idea, from the book, that I shouldn't lay down plans (and that I should learn how to roll with the story).<br/>+ 3:16 -&gt; I had no idea, from the book, how I was supposed to frame non-combat scenes or how much the players were to drive the action.<br/>+ Gun Thief -&gt; I had no idea, from the book, how the Jagged Women character was supposed to tempt the Gun Thief.<br/>+ Universalis -&gt; I had no idea, from the book, that it wasn't a pile of crunch.<br/>+ Lady Blackbird -&gt; I had no idea, from the book, what 'hitting a Key' meant.<br/><br/>On counterpoint, the games (from the earlier days) I understood (I was able to play these games and have fun, without doing any research):<br/><br/>+ Spirit of the Century -&gt; The book offered guidelines about how to do what I was already familiar with, but in a new way.<br/>+ Don't Rest Your Head -&gt; The book had nice, long examples.<br/>+ InSpectres -&gt; The rules were easy, there was good reference, and it didn't as me to do something I wasn't already comfortable doing\u2014it didn't leave any glaring question marks or doubts.<br/><br/>In a sense, the familiarity that games book provide, by using examples or by dancing cleverly on already trodden ground, gives me confidence to go ahead without research. When games ask me to remember too many new things or ask me to perform in a new way without telling me how, I get scared, and, therefore, lose my enthusiasm.<br/><br/>And lately, the games I feel I've been able to follow, but haven't tried yet:<br/><br/>+ A Taste for Murder<br/>+ Mars Colony<br/>+ Montsegur 1244<br/>+ Love in the Time of Seid<br/><br/><br/>* Come on, you know what I mean...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297733/#Comment_297733" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T04:34:40+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  4:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If there's no wrong way to do something, it's a good idea to spell that out.

Others like to follow the recipe to the letter, following exact steps in hopes that the cake won't fall flat.  If it works, they can be bolder the next time and try throwing in more of their own style.  If it fails, they can (hopefully, if the recipe writer can be trusted) assume that they missed something important and can go back to the cookbook to figure it out.<br/><br/>RPG rules should support both approaches, just like cookbooks do.  The science is in the original rules- tell them exactly what steps to take to reliably produce fun the first time.  After that the art begins, when they start experimenting and bringing in their own style and creativity.  <br/><br/>Some people are just wired for the science, and need a clear process.  Others are wired differently and inclined to throw in handfuls of random ingredients right from the get-go, just to see what happens.  Those folks will still appreciate a clear process to use as a benchmark, but they will also like suggestions for new directions they can take ("using corn meal instead of flour isn't recommended" or"try putting bacon in your cookies!").<br/><br/>Game designers are, by definition, of the experimenting mind-set.  It can be hard to understand folks who don't understand a rule like "do this until it's enough" because that's how we do it.  Some folks need to know what enough looks like, so even if you're inclined to write the bare minimum of rules and let the players suss it out for themselves in play, it doesn't hurt to show them at least one successful path\u2014maybe the way you did it, in your last game\u2014to give them a good starting point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297774/#Comment_297774" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T10:10:15+00:00" title="October 21, 2010 10:10AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of trad RPG's are like cooking stew, you already know how to make stew, here are some new ingredients and new techniques, but ultimately it's the same stew you've had for dinner a hundred times before.

Most of the time, when people try to explain to someone else how to write a good aspect they immediately start giving examples, hoping that the listener will pick up the concept through induction (and the rules tend to take this approach, too: they frequently tell you how aspects are used or what they're for, but rarely tell you how to actually make a good one). I've listened to a lot of AP podcasts that feature FATE games and you can tell that some people just don't get aspects at all while others take to them immediately, and the people that "get it" have a really hard time explaining them to the people that don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297891/#Comment_297891" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T19:54:35+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  7:54PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan, ironically, it would be helpful to see some good examples of people explaining Aspects well.

Interesting discussion. Sorry to get back so late - my day job kicked up and got in the way of reading. <br/><br/>I'm not dumping on games that don't tell me how to play - explaining clear procedures is actually very hard - and some many things become easy once you see them. I learned to play D+D by seeing my brother Nate run it. I think he learned out to run it from some news articles on D+D that we got along with the rules in 1976 - that and that one page example of dialogue between the referee and caller in the third booklet. After that most RPGs followed the same rough format. GM tells you the situatiion and anks what you do. The players say what they do. Each one gets to do this. The GM either says yes or makes them roll (a skill, a combat roll, against a stat, etc.) The GM says what the other guys do next and rolls for them (but we have to trust their rolls because they are secret) and the procedure repeats. The only game that differed from that format in the 70's was "En Garde!" by Game Designers Workshop. It was a lot more explicit (which makes sense since they published a lot of board games).<br/><br/>Jason Morningstar said that not telling people how to play could be a feature. I'd like to hear more about that. I'm unclear on how vagueness about procedure is a virtue.<br/><br/>I understand how you don't want to tell people the best strategy but I see that as very different than describing procedure. I tell people "Make up a scene" or ask the question "What happens next?" This can be anything so I'm not dictating what has to happen - anything they say is their scene - but the flow of what people do is clear. I like the point that if the play procedures are not clear that one feels uncomfortable enough to never play the game. It is like Temple Granden's Autism insights about cows and slaughter houses. She walks through the shute and tells them what cows will be afraid of so the remove those things. If the rules are a wall of text I'm scared off any more. <br/><br/>I wonder how much the wall of text phenomena (far from a new trend in gaming) had to do with needing to flesh out a book so it looks like it is giving more even if it's fluff. <br/><br/>So Jason, please tell me more.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297945/#Comment_297945" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-22T06:50:48+00:00" title="October 22, 2010  6:50AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just looked at the web page of Itras By - I used to be able to read Old Norse (I wanted to read the Sagas) so I could just make out what they were saying.

I'm not certain that was a virtue but it was a fact. It certainly set me down the road to making games so I guess I can kind of see your point.<br/><br/>I thought your point would be that stepping up with too much structure would step on people's creativity rather than vagueness being a selling point. Personally if I have to invent how to play a game I'm not to interested in buying it. I want to spend money on games that are robust and easy to teach to new players. That means the game needs to work. It's just like with shoes. I buy shoes that feel comfortable immediately rather than say "I'll wear them till they get broken in, then they will be comfortable."<br/><br/>As I said before though, writing really good clear procedures is a lot harder than it looks.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297977/#Comment_297977" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-22T10:34:26+00:00" title="October 22, 2010 10:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Dan, ironically, it would be helpful to see some good examples of people explaining Aspects well.

So a player can get her done lots of ways. That is like real life - and thus confusing. When you add in multiple rules complexity multiplies by much more. You can get some real unexpected outcomes. From Jason's perspective on exploration this could be the source of days/months of fun. From the point of view of the newbie it might mean the difference between trying or never trying a certain game. <br/><br/>I'm thinking about limiting my initial rules to the two pages of very simple procedures and only introduce the variations (three pages) after they have played a game. I've observed that players have a strong dislike of 1. Remembering sequences of events, 2. Making decisions, and 3. Making mental gear shifts. So the more we ask them to do this (and switching from one resolution method to another is a gear shift) the more people are going to hit the wall. <br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297988/#Comment_297988" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-22T11:39:12+00:00" title="October 22, 2010 11:39AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, my personal feelings are much closer to your, Chris.

It's not that I think RPGs shouldn't talk frankly and clearly about how to play them\u2014they should\u2014but that lots of good advice of the sort can be collected into books that are separate from RPGs.<br/><br/>What I'm wary of, though, is the impulse to badmouth older games for not being as explicit in their GM instructions as we've since seen other games be. It's great when a game book can be explicit and insightful and innovative when teaching GMing, and we should learn from these games and get better at teaching our craft, but it's not as if teaching GMing is easy. We all have the luxury of hindsight and of learning from mistakes made by (and by playing) those RPGs that were less explicit in their advice or instructions.<br/><br/>Teaching GMing is a little like teaching someone how to write a novel, design a video game, or run a TV series... in real time. A lot of what's important can be taught, but a lot of it can only be learned by doing. If it were easy to teach these things\u2014or to capture the formulas and conflicts of great drama, or distill genre down to dice pools\u2014we'd have caught and tamed the dramatic story a long time ago. I, for one, dread the day that we can bottle the great GM and sell it for $4.99 on the Kindle. I like talking shop, I like discovering new tricks and techniques, and I like tackling individual play situations as they occur and treating them distinctly. I like that it's an ongoing process and I fear the idea that we can nail down the magic. I'd rather see it move around that sit dead in a box like a pinned butterfly.<br/><br/>Which, again, isn't to say that teaching how to GM is a bad idea. It's just to say that there's a place for the kind of GMing that just plain isn't easy to teach. I like that it's challenging, sometimes. I like my video games easy, but I like a bit of a challenge when I run an RPG.<br/><br/>Maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will<br/><br/>[Edit: I know I'm sparring against straw men, here, and I'm not saying that an RPG should hide the ball from anyone.

I keep thinking about the John Harper oracle games. Lady Blackbird was one of the early story games I came across. I didn't get it at first. I thought that it looked like a cool start to a game that needed to be finished. It took a little exposure to the story games world before Lady Blackbird made sense to me. It took a mindset that was not encoded into the rules to realize that the game was fantastic. Same with Ghost/Echo. In this sense, the games are incomplete, but only for some players. For others, everything you need is right there in the rules. <br/><br/>OSR games are sorta like this, and I had grown apart from old school games until I found the Old School Primer. They are still not really my prefered games to play, but they are much better after having read the primer. These games were seriously lacking to me without this outside knowledge. They did a poor job of teaching me how to find the fun in them.<br/><br/>Since then I have written a few oracle style incomplete games for my friends. They are not great, but we had fun, and we were able to get to the fun because we play together and brought a common set of gaming assumptions. To us they were complete, despite the fact that they were half formed and not at all publishable.<br/><br/>I guess I am trying to say that it is unlikely that a game can be complete and explain the rules well to every player, because we all bring different things to learning the game. I am still trying to wrap my head around Apocolypse World. Dogs I got right away. Sorceror still mystefies me, only because the subject matter is not as appealing to me. Fate was easily understandable to me. Swords and Wizardry was hard to tell where the fun was. D&amp;D 4e was an easy grasp for me, even though it is more complex.<br/><br/>In every case, what I brought to the game made the games understandable to different degrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298086/#Comment_298086" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-23T11:47:19+00:00" title="October 23, 2010 11:47AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Re: Itras By, check out<a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago II</a>andNorwegian Style, which has "Itras City" in English and a ton of other games you will love or be amazed by, Chris.</blockquote>\nHow does Itras City compare to Itras By?

How to explain...<br/><br/>" When you're playing the game in a group, and another player wants to have their character do something that could fail, you should always come up with something that could go wrong if they fail at the main thing. Make it something that will annoy the character's player, but don't make it something that will effectively stop them be able to continue play. Shoot for <i>deliciously cruel</i> poetic justice. Whenever you think you've got a really good one, just say it. You don't need to be the Gm to do it, either. And yeah, you should do it to team mate characters, like, as often as possible.<br/><br/>You should also always expect your pals are gonna do the same back to you. If they aren't, give 'em a hint. If they don't pick at you they're either skeered or they don't really love you ( kidding, kidding)"<br/><br/>Would you consider that a procedure or a style guide?
