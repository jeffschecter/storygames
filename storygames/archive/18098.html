It's a game about being stuck in a broken elevator.<br/>I first thought about it like: "hey, the setting <b>IS</b> the game". If PC are stuck in this elevator, for a few minutes or hours, what would they do? Would they start to talk to each other? about what? What have they got in common? What is different? How will they react? Will they panic?<br/><br/>I'm not sure it's a good idea or not, but since the game is all about chatting in this broken elevator, there are no stats or dice. The player has just to write a more-or-less precise description of the PC on the character sheet. That and... the "twist". Each character has a Secret.<br/>That's the key of the game...<br/>I'm not completely satisfied by this mechanism, if you people have a better idea, please don't hesitate.<br/><br/><a href="http://jdr.jehaisleprintemps.net/static/downloads/elevator-en.pdf" rel="nofollow">If you want to read (and please comment) the v0.1 draft</a>.<br/>For the geeky crowd, <a href="https://github.com/brunobord/elevator-rpg" rel="nofollow">the whole source (Markdown files) of the game is available on its github repository</a> ; you can fork it, make changes and submit changes if you want via "pull requests".<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408638/#Comment_408638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T08:09:29+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  8:09AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this!

Maybe I should point out that these are just notes to help describe yourselves to the other players.\n<blockquote>What does a GM add?</blockquote>\nA GM can lead the Players to engage into a conversation with each other. I see the GM more like a PITA for the players: if a player is keeping silent, asking questions, trying to keep the pressure up. The GM is here to maintain the atmosphere (why not putting some elevator music!).<br/>I think I may make it a bit clearer in the rules\n<blockquote>Does everyone need a secret?<br/>What compels me to telegraph my secret?</blockquote>\nWhat compels me to find out other people's secrets?<br/><br/>This is were I'm not very confident about this "twist". I wanted to give players a goal to achieve, something they all have in common, and that can keep them going on with the discussion during the game.<br/>My brain is still trying to cook a better idea up, though, this "Secret" thing is not 100% sure for the "playable v1.0 release".<br/><br/>Again, thank you very much for your questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408668/#Comment_408668" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T15:55:51+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  3:55PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd use cards to add random elevator-related elements.

Yes, the theme of characters trapped indefinitely in a small space isn\u2019t new, but, as Jason Morningstar says, you can make it distinguishable. I actually wanted to comment on this post as soon as I clapped eyes on it, but couldn\u2019t for various reasons. Anyway, here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>1.\tCheck out <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/2012/07/little-spaces-entries-16-micro-bundles.html" rel="nofollow">the entries in  1km1kt.net\u2019s Small Spaces comp</a>. There\u2019s even one called Claustrophobia, which is obviously going to be the focus of a game set in a broken elevator (or \u2018lift\u2019, as we say on the other side of the pond).<br/>2.\tWatch a couple of movies with a similar focus, fr\u2019x Towering Inferno, the Poseidon Adventure, and the non-comedy Airplane.<br/>3.\tOne of the things you get in Airplane is the fact that most of the characters have an agenda of some kind, which is sort of like secrets, e.g. the sweaty middle-aged businessman has to get to the office to sign a lucrative deal with an important customer; the nervous, mousey young woman is engaged to be married, but is having doubts, and is going to a rendezvous with her fianc\xe9e to have it out with him; one guy stays very quiet throughout the whole ordeal, refusing to be drawn on who he is, what he does and what he\u2019s doing in the building. Etc.<br/>4.\tThe characters all have different resistances to stress, so they start to fold after different lengths of time and in different ways. One of the stressors could be the other characters\u2019 reactions to stress, fr\u2019x one of them starts to shout and scream for help, at which the sweaty businessman (SB) yells at him to pull himself together. <br/>5.\tNot sure how it would work diceless. One of the things I would want to include would be a resilience track, which the characters would progress along in the manner of the sanity track in CoC, something like <i>totally strung-out\u2026\u2026\u2026.zen-like calm</i>. But how to move them along it? First, I think they\u2019d all start on different points, so SB would come, as it were, pre-stressed, and would already be sweating and harassed-looking as he entered the lift. And I think progression should be not arithmetic but staggered, as they react to events in-game, which could be either the other characters\u2019 reactions or GM\u2019led (if you <i>have</i> a GM, but I know you\u2019re thinking of it as GMless).<br/>6.\tOne by one each character should have a set-piece monologue, which could either be revealing their agenda, or simply how they\u2019re feeling at that moment. <br/>7.\tCharacters could build emotional alliances with each other, possibly against other characters. <br/>8.\tI\u2019d like it if there were an Epilogue, where each character would narrate where they are in six months\u2019 time.<br/><br/>More ideas as and when they pop into my head. Btw feel free to reject outright any of the above, after all it\u2019s your game not mine. But I <i>really</i> want you to designs this; it\u2019s right up my indie hippie street, and I would offer it up at cons here in the UK when you produce a beta version.<br/><br/>Oh and\n<blockquote>I'd use cards to add random elevator-related elements.  Maybe things like Sudden Lurch, Loud Creaking Sound, Flickering Lights, Voice From Outside, but nothing to obtrusive.    <br/><br/>The elevator cards could create that impetus, I imagine?  <br/>I think it might be more claustrophobic without a GM.
