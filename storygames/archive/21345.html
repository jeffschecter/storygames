I think there are two reasons for this:<br/><br/><b>1. Power Creep</b><br/>Unless you\u2019re using the little brown books (LBBs) or a conservative retroclone (say, Swords &amp; Wizardry Whitebox), chances are that the PCs are more powerful than their OD&amp;D counterparts.<br/><br/>My homebrew campaign, for instance, has replaced 3d6-in-order ability score generation for something slightly more generous and uses a stripped-down version of DCC which grants characters some powerful special abilities.<br/><br/><b>2. Focus Fire</b><br/>Perhaps more significantly, my players focus their attacks (as well as limited-use resources such as wands) on <b>any monster that stands out from the crowd</b> (e.g. an orc shaman or even just a wolf pack\u2019s alpha with one extra hit die).<br/><br/>I suspect this isn\u2019t an issue if the DM maintains the fog of war and disengaging from melee is difficult, but our combat system is very close to D&amp;D 3.5e / 4e with a grid and miniatures, 5-ft-steps, opportunity attacks etc. \u2013 and plenty of tactical mobility.<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>I have successfully been using templates <b>in the vein of D&amp;D 4e\u2019s \u201celite\u201d and \u201csolo\u201d designations</b> for some time now:<br/><br/>The \u201celite\u201d template, for instance, provides a creature with double hit points, a generous bonus to one save (Fortitude etc. \u2013 not old school at all, I know) and one special ability (e.g. an extra action each round or attacking with a d24 instead of a d20 and scoring a crit on 20+).<br/><br/>I apply the template to magical creatures only as the in-game rationale is that <b>magic energy pools in special individuals</b>. Hence, the template is applied to unique creatures (e.g. the only Otygh in the dungeon, but no Otyghs if they are to be found in every second garbage pit) and \u2013 with a certain probability - to one individual in a given group (e.g. \u201c4 trolls\u201d might have one \u201celite\u201d troll).<br/><br/>(Also, the template vanishes when a creature is domesticated, much as a monster\u2019s darkvision does in OD&amp;D when under the control of a player character.)<br/><br/>It\u2019s important to me to determine the templates and who they get applied to far in advance. In the past, I've sometimes buffed monsters after the players had begun tackling the module and that's a <b>dangerously unhygienic practice</b>, I think.<br/><br/>I\u2019m still grappling with powering-up entire modules for use with higher-level characters, though.<br/><br/>The aforementioned templates allow me to use modules more-or-less as intended (i.e. for the officially given level range). However, I\u2019d like to have a reasonably <b>quick and dirty way to change a module for use with higher-level characters</b>. Special abilities and spells might mean that the characters make short work of the module, but that's okay.<br/><br/>(If I invest a lot of time in adapting or crafting a module, <b>I have a harder time just letting go</b>. If the players busted a dam to flood a dungeon and drown every kobold therein, that'd be much easier on me if I hadn't invested hours into detailing the different kobold factions... 'Tis one of the biggest advantages of using ready-made modules.)<br/><br/>Specifically, I\u2019m toying with putting Matthew Finch's \u201cTomb of the Iron God\u201d (for 4-8 1st or 2nd level characters) on the map at some point, albeit as a challenge for 3rd to 5th level characters (or thereabouts).<br/><br/>Should I just add d6 hit dice to every creature? Does that even make sense, flavour-wise?<br/><br/>(At the moment, the characters are at name-level and embroiled in \u201cAgainst the Giants\u201d, so none of this is urgent.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467276/#Comment_467276" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-27T13:36:28+00:00" title="October 27, 2017  1:36PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, for me doing this sort of thing - adding hit dice to creatures for no in-fiction reason, for instance - would mess with a variety of cornerstones that I use in calibrating anything at all.<br/><br/>If I wanted to adapt a low-level adventure to higher levels, I'd probably just take the map and repopulate it with a new backstory. So instead of the Tomb of the Iron God being home to goblins and undead it becomes the "Living Iron Sanctuary", with golems and weird incorporeal undead, or something of the sort. Perhaps puzzle elements down in the basement, like you need to interrogate ghosts to get necessary knowledge for passing magical barriers.

This works for kobolds, goblins, orcs etc., but not for bugbears etc. because a tribe of savages with everyone at 3 HD doesn't make sense. That said, I like Vivificient's suggestion of justifying a (modest) power-up with a recent victorous conflict.)<br/><br/>I buffed entire sections of the Barrowmaze, which my players explored from character level 1 to 5. It was a somewhat haphazard process, but went reasonably well: I replaced some monsters with more powerful creatures or increased HD on undead (with a more threatening description to match, e.g. "these zombies are much faster and covered in black runes"). Most importantly, I managed to do this <b>well in advance of the PCs exploring the buffed sectors</b>.<br/><br/>(Undead and demons are easy to upgrade or replace, whereas creatures with a culture or theme (such as trap-building kobolds) are harder or impossible to do.)<br/><br/>I was and am very <b>leery of buffing a dungeon as it is being explored</b> because I do not want to take away from the players' success. That said, the prospect of more than half of the Barrowmaze megadungeon becoming a cakewalk because I had not anticipated just how much more powerful DCC characters are compared to OD&amp;D characters was a bit much. If it had been a single module, I wouldn't have a changed a thing, I think/hope. I've presided over both cakewalks and one TPK in this campaign.<br/><br/><b>Do you guys ever change things behind the scenes?

Rather, if changing something on the fly becomes absolutely necessary, I convene a panel of players (basically, whoever's at the table at that time) to decide collectively on the extra-regular matter that I feel needs to be addressed. I don't simply consider the GM to have extraordinary powers of judgement, he only has those powers that the game procedure allots him - and that mostly doesn't allow him to change things up "behind the scenes".<br/><br/>For example - and this is a hypothetical scenario for sake of clarity, plus because these situations are sort of rare - let's say that the sandbox play has brought us to a point where the adventurers are adventuring in a maturely themed dungeon, but the group happens to include children tonight. Let's furthermore say that the mature themes aren't superficial descriptive details that I could gloss over. What I would do in this situation would be that I'd explain the matter to the group, and we could make a collective call: either the players give me free rein to adjust the material appropriately (with the associated risk that the changes end up making a difference to the fate of the adventurers), or they choose another adventure for now, and we'll return to this one later with an adult crew.<br/><br/>If I had a limit to the amount of adventure material in the campaign (no Internet, or a very specific campaign setting, for example), and I were feeling the prep pressure, and needed to provide more material for the game, I would perhaps need to do something to solve the issue. Even then, though, I don't see re-leveling adventures as very likely; if I already have an adventure that's otherwise fine except it'd be a cakewalk for the strongest party, why not ask the players to try it with a weaker one? I think is is an entirely legit thing to ask for from the players: we bend and twist in-setting probabilities all the time to provide the adventurers with plentiful adventure hooks, so suggesting that perhaps this adventure is one where your high-level characters don't go for some reason is entirely in line with that logic. Maybe they're busy with their downtime activities or something. Ultimately, if I don't have good high-level material (and I do not, generally speaking, consider a re-leveled low-level adventure good enough), perhaps the campaign should stay at low levels?<br/><br/>You can probably see how I wrestle with the necessity of this concept. I'm sure it's useful for you, but I don't see myself re-statting adventures to new levels any time soon. I could just make a new adventure for the same effort, seems to me - and probably should, from what I've seen of mid-level play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467317/#Comment_467317" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T12:55:06+00:00" title="October 29, 2017 12:55PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll offer a suggestion, but honestly, I think it's a cruel one and a bit outside of the normal play procedure that most people GMing even OSR stuff would do.<br/><br/>Turn on all of the movement and lighting/visual range switches, the using up of resources switches, and play even chaotic humanoids as relatively intelligent and organized.<br/><br/>It may well turn dungeons into utter bloodbaths, however. A jaunt to the Caves of Chaos becomes a fantasy remake of the film <i>The Descent.<br/></i><br/>Movement rates:<br/>Check out the 10 minute exploration move rates versus  the tactical combat move rates.<br/>Generally, PCs (and monsters) can move much quicker if they aren't exploring, although if thy aren't exploring PCs can't map. This isn't a problem for monsters since they're on their home turf and won't get lost.<br/><br/>The upshot: Monsters, once alerted to an incursion by a PC party can use all of the side passages and bypasses, both to get away from enemies and to rally and get behind or in front of them, or both.<br/><br/>Lighting range<br/>All those poor humans can only see within the radius of a light source. Most monsters have some kind of vision that works in darkness, even if it's a very short distance.<br/><br/>Upshot: monsters can back pedal just out of visual range of the lighting distance and use ranged weapons. If they knock out the light source, even better for them. Be sure to us the to hit mods for blind fighting and darkness.<br/><br/>Also, while a light source only lights up a limited radius, in an otherwise dark dungeon, that light source can be seen effectively an unlimited straight line distance. If there is a 200' long, straight, level, corridor a creature will be able to see a light source at the other end of it, even though the person holding the lantern can't see the critter in the darkness at the other end of it.<br/><br/>Resources:<br/>Torches and lanterns go out. Arrows and other ammo depletes ( or roll to recover or whatever). Do you really want to be in the dungeon, way down deep in it as those things start to run out?<br/><br/>Humanoids and tactics:<br/>Especially with small weedy humanoids ( goblins, kobolds), they're more likely to use hit and run, bypass and re-appear tactics on PC parties. And I really do mean hit and run. Like, shoot once and run to get help, whether you hit or not. They're also likely to make at least ad hoc rally points within their complex/den. If they're really sneaky, they might even a allow a dangerous looking party to get fairly far into the complex, load themselves up with loot, and then begin  a harassment campaign of hit and run on the party while the party is on the way back out of the complex, since they'll be moving even slower at that point, and low on supplies ( including, potentially, magic).<br/><br/>It's when the party is really bad off that all of those gobboes who have been massing at the rally points and psyching themselves up pour in from all sides. Heck, they might even wait to hit the party on the road home from the dungeon, when they think they're safe again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467318/#Comment_467318" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T13:10:52+00:00" title="October 29, 2017  1:10PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a> Honestly, I don't know why that wouldn't be SOP for any OSR game.  <br/><br/>My cruel turn of the screw would be to not buff the dungeon, but to have another hostile dungeoneering party enter the dungeon.

You're often only able to consider these matters in hindsight, as something that you should pay more attention to. It's taken me years of diligence to get my table manners and practical procedures to a point where I can do everything else I need to do, and then remember to tell the players to check their encumbrances and such on top. (And yes, this part of the game is much easier if you can elect an adventurer field sergeant to take care of it - the players presumably aren't children, so they should be able to track their own torches.)<br/><br/>The general point is a good one, though, that it could be the case that there is a "difficulty slack" in-built into the campaign due to wargaming practices that favour the adventurers in the sorts of things that Bob lists. Can't say whether this is the case for any given campaign, of course, but it's a possibility.<br/><br/>As a practical example relating to the <i>Tomb of the Iron God</i>, the way I run the various sorts of monsters combined with the geometry and stocking of the 2nd level make for some interesting times for adventurers: if the ghouls living in there act as cunning post-human predators (not unreasonable, and that's often what ghouls are like in my play), the adventurers daring those tunnels will soon get to experience all the joys of the so-called fantasy Vietnam. The ghouls have the advantages of superior senses, familiar territory (traps included), plentiful allies in the form of other undead, secret passages, and their strategic goals are much more achievable than those of the adventurers, as they just need to pick off one or two at a time and retreat to feast. The difficulty level of that dungeon depends sharply on whether the ghouls act as mindless monsters, or if they're ambush predators (or worse, human-intelligent stalkers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467326/#Comment_467326" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T18:49:53+00:00" title="October 29, 2017  6:49PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do use <b>limited resources</b> (torches, ammo), <b>encumbrance</b> (the excellent LotFP system), <b>limited visibility</b> (none of the demihumans have darkvision because I want light to be an issue), <b>encounter checks</b> (every second turn) and <b>morale</b> (for monsters and henchmen, though on balance this is an advantage for the players).<br/><br/>I do not, however, play monsters as smart. They do respond to incursions, band together and lay ambushes, but ony slowly and over-confidently and -- more importantly -- I handle round-to-round tactics with a strong random element:<br/><br/>In particular,<b> I randomize target selection</b>, and do so monster by monster, i.e. there is usually little to no focus fire or coordinated action. After having run and having played illusionist games for over two decades, I do not trust myself to be unbiased.<br/><br/>Gary's had a rough day at the office? Vicky's character is down to 2 hit points? Frankly, I do not trust myself making the decision to attack or not attack their characters. Hence, I fall back on random target selection. I won't send intelligent monsters into suicidal positions, but given a range of viable targets, <b>I'll usually split up a d6 for purposes of target selection</b>, favoring heavily armored fighters (or anyone offering himself, for example by taunting the monsters). <br/><br/>So I might declare something like "Okay, the giant seeks a tough target, so 1-3 is Carl's fighter in the shining armor, 4-5 is Gary's fighter and 6 means another random frontline combatant (probably a henchman or low-level PC, but certainly someone placed in the frontline).<br/><br/>I make most monsters try to <b>stick to one target from round to round</b>, at least, and the aforementioned "elite" templates (of which there are about a dozen) have default behaviour as yet unknown to the players (e.g. "attack the toughest looking target", "attack the weakest melee target", "attack a spellcaster" etc.).<br/><br/>With some templates (e.g. "mastermind": the monster and all allies receive +1 to all rolls including morale), I'll pull out all the stops and try to play the entire monster side as smart as I can -- and this has proven deadly on several occasions. I'm not 100% comfortable with this, so I've set the chance for this sort of monster coordination quite low.<br/><br/>(I'm similarly squeamish on the strategic level, as I've had some bad experiences with (poor) illusionists DMs who shot down every player plan until an appropriate level of frustration / respect for the DM's cool monster fortress had been established (say, an hour or two), before then allowing the most hare-brained schemes to succeed (all the good ideas for infiltration had long been shot down). The standard argument was "my NPC is sooo smart he would have thought of that / gathered the intel on your PC etc.)<br/><br/>I'm mostly happy with this, I might add. I'd rather let the players tackle an adventure outside their level range against dumb monsters than try to make the most of a bunch of kobolds. YMMV, obviously.<br/><br/>(And because I probably sounded bitter about illusionism above: I've enjoyed a lot of illusionist play and this can be handled with grace and skill on both sides of the table. My tastes have changed, is all, and I'm trying hard not to fall back into old habits. Not necessarily bad habits, but inappropriate to what I'm trying for these days.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467327/#Comment_467327" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T21:14:28+00:00" title="October 29, 2017  9:14PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the monster template idea in general, by the way. I haven't commented on it in relation to the basic question about dungeon leveling, because I don't necessarily see the connection, but there are other reasons to work out something like that. The basic traditions of the "dungeon scripting language" we use for writing out dungeons leave the dungeon author the freedom to provide a merely minimal description, so having a templating system with some basic principles for its application is a great way to breathe depth into a flat dungeon spec.<br/><br/>(Not every campaign will benefit from doing this sort of monster customization, it depends on where your particular focus and information processing bottlenecks lie. If handling customized monsters caused me slow-downs rather than improving the fictional texture, I'd run with stock items in a heartbeat. I'm definitely not saying that flat dungeon specs are a bad thing - if anything I prefer them to richly detailed ones, really.)<br/><br/>The biggest example of my doing something of that sort has been in relation to goblinoid tribes, which may or may not be presented flat in dungeon writeups. By flat I mean that the spec only lists locations and head-counts, without distinguishing any sorts of castes or or equipment or individuals. At one point, when we were running particularly goblinoid-heavy materials (like Dyson's Delve and Tomb of the Iron God and a few other goblin-featuring adventures side by side in a sandbox), I started giving depth to those flat write-ups with methods sort of similar to your templating:<br/><b>*</b> If a bunch of humanoids are given depth in spec, that goes, and no further action is needed aside from converting and gilding it for the campaign, as one does. The following process is only for those minimal "5 goblins" listings.<br/><b>*</b> A bunch N goblins has a N/6 chance (roll d6 against N) of including a "goblin brave", by which I mean an accomplished tribal warrior of a primitive culture. For larger groups there might be more of them: just continue rolling and adding against their total count. Braves are just like hobgoblins (and are in fact the same thing in our historical fantasy campaign - full hobgoblin groups are simply war parties of the goblin tribes, consisting solely of accomplished warriors). Goblins who survive adventurer encounters do, indeed, turn into "braves", and player character goblins start out as "braves" - they're sort of like 1st-level goblins instead of 0-level ones, if you will.<br/><b>*</b> Listed goblins in a flat description are always assumed to be combatants unless otherwise specified, but if HPs are provided, I'll assume that the low-scoring ones are young, old or female, should that come to matter. (The goblins in our historical-fantasy campaigns are basically human, whence the gender attribution - fantasy goblins might work differently.) If the module specs no non-combatants, I'll either posit a hunt/war camp affair of some sort to explain it, or add the non-combatants on top of the specced combat-ready goblins.<br/><b>*</b> Unless otherwise specified, I'll assume that half of the goblin population of the dungeon is out hunting at any given time, to account for random encounters with them, and to give some sense for reinforcement dynamics, and what they've got if they get to gather their forces.<br/><b>*</b> The above steps give me a head count for the total goblin population in the location (could be multiple tribes/clans, which I'll need to account for, of course). If the headcount (including non-combatants and reserves) is over 40 or so, there'll be a chief and a shaman - if the module doesn't spec these, I'll just appoint some goblins from the flat spec. The chief and shaman are potentially leveled NPC (I have my own process for determining NPC levels, tends towards low values).<br/><br/>The end-outcome of this "spiffying-up" of flat goblin descriptions is that the goblins do end up slightly more mechanically punchy than the dungeon write-up implies; although most of the stuff I do falls into imponderables as far as dungeon specs usually go, the braves and the rulers do provide the goblins with not just leadership, but also potentially some slightly elevated mechanical statistics.<br/><br/>I suppose that the reason for why I'm not enthusiastic about leveling-up dungeons, yet I evidently do something sort of similar in some cases, is that I view my goblin-work more as a matter of campaign conversion than a process intended to shift the challenge level, even if it does end up doing a little bit of that. This is simply what the goblins are like in this world, you get a bunch of them together and they're going to sort themselves out a bit and form a community. Not that different from deciding whether or not goblins understand Common language.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467339/#Comment_467339" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-30T14:01:38+00:00" title="October 30, 2017  2:01PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I didn\u2019t know exactly what I wanted out of this thread but the discussion has cleared this up: I would like to have <b>dungeon templates</b>: A quick set of procedures to simultaneously increase an existing dungeon\u2019s difficulty and provide (gameable) flavour.<br/><br/>(It\u2019s also becoming clear to me that this is a pretty tall order, particularly the "quick" part...)<br/><br/>Let me give two examples I\u2019ve cooked up just now:<br/><br/><b>Template 1: Dungeon of Plenty</b><br/>The dungeon contains <b>huge amounts of food</b> and the <b>twice the numbers of foes</b> who would benefit from that  (i.e. goblins, giant beetles and oozes and so forth but not constructs, demons, and undead etc.). This refers back to Vivificient\u2019s original idea.<br/><br/>It\u2019s important that the DM comes up with <b>an explanation for the abundance of food</b>. In this example, one might decide that an army from the Underdark made camp here, mysteriously vanished and left a huge number of army supplies. Or one might decide that most of the dungeon is overgrown by an edible fungus.<br/><br/>Either way, the dungeon suddenly has an evocative (additional) theme which both enables the DM to expand upon it and which is potentially gameable: The army supplies from the underdark are presumably conserved and tradeable (if not necessarily aboveground, given that we\u2019re probably looking at barrels of dried fungus, salted sides of giant beetle and so forth). A dungeon overgrown with fungi might be difficult terrain and the PCs might be able to set fire to the entire dungeon. And so on.<br/><br/><b>Template 2: Dungeon of Frost<br/></b> The dungeon is extremely cold with <b>temperatures at -2d20 degrees Celsius</b>. All bodies of water are frozen, rooms originally described as moist are glazed with a layer of ice and/or have icicles everywhere, cold-blooded creatures are either slowed or incapacitated and so on. Moreover, <b>two prevalent monster types  are immune to cold</b>. The resulting frost goblins, for instance, should then be described as blue-skinned or whatever.<br/><br/>Once again, the DM needs to come up with an explanation, such as a frost curse (Who pronounced it? Why? How can it be lifted?).<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>I think such templates would be useful to spice up an otherwise bland dungeon or throw a curveball at DM and players alike (possibly making the dungeon nigh unplayable, such as an originally flooded dungeon with the frost template). <br/><br/>Used on a highly idiosyncratic or flavourful dungeon might lead to interesting combinations but might also ruin the original author\u2019s vision.<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>Addressing some other points:<br/><br/><b>Forgetting to keep track of ammo, encumbrance and so on</b>. There are some tools to help (e.g. Faster Monkey Games\u2019 Turntracker) but players fully on board with the aesthetic and the challenge aspect are best, i.e. players who\u2019ll happily remind you that they're out of torches or that the dragon has a chance to recharge its breath weapon because they would not want a victory any other way.<br/><br/><b>Spiffying up goblins as a matter of campaign conversion</b>: This sounds cool and I think I see what you're doing here, but would like to learn more: What's the chief impetus to detail the goblins?<br/><br/>(E.g. Are you channeling the world (i.e. thinking about the centrally featured goblins between sessions and formalizing stuff)? Do you anticipate the PCs interacting with the goblins in ways that require more detail (i.e. do the PCs typically charm/interrogate intelligent creatures, so you'll likely need to know the goblins' command structure and factions)?)<br/><br/><b>Hostile NPC parties showing up</b>: Putting adventuring parties on the encounter table is fine by me and there might be a nice template here (\u201cgold rush\u201d), but I\u2019d leave their disposition to a reaction roll and would randomize other stuff, too. Of course, a \u201cblast from the past\u201d encounter where the PCs run into established rivals is entirely appropriate for an encounter table.<br/><br/><b>The dungeon is the battlefield</b>: This is good advice. A dungeon should be a dynamic place, not a collection of static set-pieces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467340/#Comment_467340" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-30T14:04:56+00:00" title="October 30, 2017  2:04PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2017 2:05PM by komradebob.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [X-Posted with Johann]<br/>In the "Kobold Den" situation, I think, as GM, you could potentially also take a very Neutral GM, Frei Kriegspiel approach with the likely reactions of the humanoids and account for the fact that they're chaotic ( whatever that means in your world).<br/><br/>All I mean by that is that is that you could use judgment calls to create rolls to determine things like response times and assessments/understanding by the opposition elements in the dungeon, then go with a cascade of what those judgements ( and rolls) mean to their overall reaction and response.<br/><br/>IOW, it might be equally fair to the players to assume that their enemies don't have perfect intelligence and planning either.<br/><br/>Of course, that all gets messy and outside the rules as written, but not necessarily outside of the spirit of the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467345/#Comment_467345" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-30T16:10:25+00:00" title="October 30, 2017  4:10PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think I didn\u2019t know exactly what I wanted out of this thread but the discussion has cleared this up: I would like to have <b>dungeon templates</b>: A quick set of procedures to simultaneously increase an existing dungeon\u2019s difficulty and provide (gameable) flavour.</p></div></blockquote>\nI like this, same as the monster templates.

Knowing your take on D&amp;D, this makes perfect sense. I really dig this approach, no least because <b>it avoids sinking time into stuff that never comes up in play</b>, whether its rules or background or a natural combination of both.<br/><br/>In almost thirty years of play, I guess I've seen about two or three situations where a character was in danger of drowning. Yet, many traditional rules have a section for the DM on this. One might argue that it's life-or-death and quite common in some action-oriented genres - and maybe your mileage varies on this - but personally I'd prefer it if this and lots of other stuff were left out of D&amp;D's rules. If it does come up, seasoned veterans won't have trouble making a ruling -- and for newbies, it's a great learning opportunity. And if you're playing a dungeon divers campaign in a flooded mega-dungeon, then you'll systemize that stuff soon enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467398/#Comment_467398" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-01T13:40:38+00:00" title="November  1, 2017  1:40PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's very hard to be scrupulously neutral when makin those sorts of spot rulings.<br/><br/>I suspect it may have been slightly easier for those very early GMs ( pre-D&amp;D) who really were in many ways referees, making those calls but for several competing players/groups of players.<br/><br/>In that situation, you don't want to be accused of favoritism, but it is also easier not to engage in favoritism. If you have nearly  twenty players, and Joe in the Friday session has his 5th level fighter killed and is forced to make a new character at 1st level...well, that's just the breaks. Everyone in the campaign deals with that sort of possibility.<br/><br/>It's a bit different when it's your one group of  consistent players. When you've been GMing for a while for a group, their characters have levelled up, and then Joe's fighter gets killed, it's a whole lot tougher to tell the to start a new 1st level character. Not only is it tough on them, it's tough on you as GM. Now everyone has to figure out how to fit Joe's new, low level character into things until they level up and match everyone else, and not killed while doing it. Even in a open sandbox set up, that can be tricky.<br/><br/><br/>Your post about drowning rules and dungeon divers made me laugh a bit, but I do get where you're coming from.<br/><br/>When I stared with B/X many years back, that's essentially how we did it. Make a spot rule as necessary for uncommon events when they occur. If it comes up regularly, build a subsystem ( or steal one from a magazine article or dungeon module that has something similar already).<br/><br/>I suspect lots of people did that. Certainly AD&amp;D looks a whole lot like a bunch of spot rules that Gygax made, which he later systematized for his own home games, then published for profit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
