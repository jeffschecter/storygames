The subtle character tweaks all seem perfect, the equipment list makes encumbrance and gold super fun, and the big monster section was fun to read. Even better, the "first session" rules really helped me to get the idea of asking questions. <br/><br/>As each player made their character, I asked them specific questions about many things on their sheet, like "What went wrong at the end of your last quest?" for a character who's God sends them out on missions. The characters were rich and interesting. I started them in a tense situation this time, and it definitely made it fun to ask the characters why they were there and their relationship to the villains. So, the question-asking was a major success. <br/><br/>But... I still don't get combat. For background, I've never played AW, and every time I've played a game without turns, I get thrown for the same loop. <br/><br/>The 3 players crawled through a small tunnel into a cavern the size of a small room. They spoke at the 4 goblins for a few moments before the goblins attacked in a frenzy. All 4 goblins charge at once, serrated swords at the ready. <br/><br/>I ask "what do you do", and one of the players naturally pipes up and wants to attack. Hack and slash. Good so far. <br/><br/>I then ask "what do you do" again, and the next player wants to shoot an arrow at the oncoming goblins. They're nearly in melee range, so I say they must defy danger (because they are about to volley).  They do so, and roll in the 7-9 range. I say that the extra goblin is coming at his head at the same time as the first dives for his feat (ugly choice?). He sends a volley at the one at his head, getting a 7-9, and not killing it. I say he takes damage from it (similar to hack and slash), and he is tackled by the one at his feet. <br/><br/>Looking back, that seems like an extremely poor outcome for such decent rolls. The characters seem like they should be better than that? Defy danger before a volley seemed weird, and it happened again later - a 7-9 on Defy danger followed by a 7-9 on Volley made for lots of problems for a small amount of success. <br/><br/>Moving on, I ask "What do you do" again, and the next player "goes".  They start to gravitate towards "turns" at this point). Turns continue for the rest of the combat. I couldn't figure out how to avoid them. Players wanted to go and felt like turns were the only way to do it. <br/><br/>Later, a player hacks'n'slashes a goblin, taking damage from 2 of them (because there are 2 goblins "on" him). Even later, two players attack the same goblin and both take damage from him (because they both rolled a 7-9). See why I'm confused? <br/><br/>The thief player left combat feeling very useless, because he never rolled higher than a 9, and rolled one 6. <br/><br/>So, all-in-all, my problems are mainly<br/><br/>1) Too many failures. 7-9s feel like failures.<br/>2) I don't get turns, or the lack thereof. How do you avoid them, or embrace them?<br/><br/>Thanks! And keep up the good work!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330911/#Comment_330911" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T21:48:37+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  9:48PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This can definitely be a challenge at first as I found this too. I think it was the players and my expectations that a D&amp;D-like game should have turns that really hit us down, and because the earlier version offered this as an option (but Sage and Adam have now wisely removed it). After playing AW I finally got it because my expectations weren't constrained, so this is an option. I'd recommending persevering as it is totally worth it once it clicks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330914/#Comment_330914" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T22:13:10+00:00" title="June 20, 2011 10:13PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No advice, but I have two links for you that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">might</span> I hope help:<br/><br/><a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2011/05/apocalypse-world-guide-to-hard-moves.html" rel="nofollow">Guide to Hard Moves</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=1651.msg9617#msg9617" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World thread that tackled similar issues</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330952/#Comment_330952" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T07:55:56+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  7:55AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2011 8:34AM by Ludanto.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GAAHR!

It's worth it.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Read the linked items above.<br/><br/>C) Here are my observations.  Your problems might not be the same exactly, but they sound similar:<br/><br/>1) Remember that there is no GM turn. (Yes, I know you know, but remember.)  You're not supposed to do anything with the monsters until the PCs fail a roll or stand there gawking at you waiting to see what the monsters do next.  When they do that (wait for the GM's "turn", that is), hit them HARD (as in 'hard move').  The players are new, too, of course, so explain to them that they, having just stood there, gave you permission to smack them down.  So, direct damage or nasty monster move.  Danger to Defy at the very least.  Don't wuss out with Signs of Doom, though.  That should discourage the players from waiting for the GM's turn as well.<br/><br/>2) Remember that there are no player turns. (Yes, I know you know, but remember.)  Ask the players what they do, but don't hold them to that until one of them (your choice, probably whoever would have acted first) rolls, and then see if the results can spiral out of control ("moves snowball").  Then ask them what they do <i>now</i>.  Maybe they ignore it and keep doing what they would have done anyway.  Maybe they do something else.<br/><br/>3) When you get the opportunity, "spring a trap", "turn the environment against them" and "separate them" can mix things up in interesting ways that might break up the "turn" structure.<br/><br/>4) Hack and Slash can sometimes be confused with "general combat".  Don't let that happen.  Hack and Slash is for aggressive player attacks.  If you get a move, and a monster attacks with it, "I hack and slash" is (probably) not a real defensive choice.  "So, you're taking the hit and attacking it anyway?"  Once the PCs start Hack and Slash, though, the monsters will mostly be on the defensive until the players miss.  Also keep in mind that the monster's "attack" from a less-than-perfect Hack and Slash can be a monster move instead, or even just "It shoves you to the ground!"<br/><br/>5) If your players' "soft" hits feel too punitive, remember that you're in control of how bad those "spots", "hard bargains", "tough decisions" and "unwanted attentions" are.  If it feels right and makes sense in the fiction, you can totally softball them.<br/><br/>I'm not an authority, but that's what's working for me.  I hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330966/#Comment_330966" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T08:48:15+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  8:48AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding Hack'n Slash - In most games you would attack your enemy and then they would attack you.  Damage would be dealt both ways.  That's what happens on a 7-9.  It might help to point out that on a 10+ its like you are getting an attack of opportunity or a critical hit.  I don't know if framing it that way helps.  <br/><br/>Regarding turns: Taking turns is good (I learned that in kindergarten) but taking <i>turns </i>is unnecessary.  As MC (or is it master of dungeons?  Sean Hess, MD - has a nice ring...) you should definitely be waving the spotlight around like crazy.  While its a good thing if everyone gets more or less the same amount of time in the spotlight, try to let the events occur organically.  You can also use your spotlight to help someone out when they are falling behind in XP - giving them more opportunities to act will allow them to make more moves with highlighted stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330969/#Comment_330969" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T09:16:54+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  9:16AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone has already said the vast majority of what I came here to say.

DO NOT DO THIS.</b><br/><br/>(Sorry to pick on you, Ludanto, but that bit of advice is way off base)<br/><br/>Of course there are turns! It's a conversation. You take turns talking, right?. Also, there are beats to the action in the fiction. The PCs are doing things. The monsters are doing things. Say what the monsters do! Don't wait around for the players to "gawk" at you and don't just wait for failed rolls to take action.<br/><br/>Instead: Picture the fictional scene in your head. What's happening? What would the monster do? Say that. Look at the monster moves for ideas. Give everyone a chance to talk and take action, including yourself.<br/><br/>Just remember: unless you're making a hard move (see the rules for that) say what the monster does, <i>but not its effect</i>. Then ask what they do. Sometimes the monsters will be moving around, getting in position. Sometimes they'll be swarming on top of the fighter, trying to tear his eyes out. Say what the monsters do, make it all dungeony and exciting and cool, put them in a spot, then ask what they do.<br/><br/>As GM, you will make moves <i>all the time</i>. NOT just when they look at you. NOT just when they fail a roll. <b>All the time!</b> Remember: making GM moves means (so-called) "soft" moves, too. Say what's happening. Have your monsters take action! Be part of the conversation. Paint the picture of perilous dungeon adventure.<br/><br/>Sorry for the mini-rant. I just get annoyed at this particular myth, that the GM is supposed to wait around and only make moves when a hard move is called for. That's not how it's done. Doing that will warp the game and send you down a not-fun path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331011/#Comment_331011" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T12:25:08+00:00" title="June 21, 2011 12:25PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone's already said it, but: the thing here is turns as in a conversation and turns as in initiative order. DW has turns like a conversation ("never a monologue"), not turns like initiative order. Moves are what you do when it's your turn to talk. The phrasing we use might be a bit strong ("when everyone looks at you"), which might lead to some misconceptions, but the basic thing is that when you have to say what's happening, you make a move. That's where turns come in.<br/><br/>You'll also notice that some of the moves give you natural segues to other bits of the action. For example, Avon casts magic missile, but his concentration gives the goblin backstabber a chance to spring from the shadows, landing on Avon's back. The goblin's riding Avon, trying to get in a good stab (Avon got a 7-9, I put him in a spot). I could stick with Avon, but this also gives me an opportunity to see what someone else is up to, with this as a prompt. "Castor, you're knee deep in sludge, locked in battle with the crocodillian, when you hear Avon's yell of surprise behind you. A quick glance and you see that there's a goblin on his back, trying to stab him, what do you do?"<br/><br/>There's a turn there, like a conversation turn. I decided to switch the focus to someone else because:<br/>-I didn't want to turn it into a monologue, so I need to let someone else talk<br/>-I felt like fictionally Avon probably had a few startled moments before he has a chance to really react to the surprise attack, so fictionally someone else should act<br/>There's a rules reason and a fictional reason. If you take "turns" like that, I think you'll find there's more flow.<br/><br/>Note also that not every "turn" is a move. When you ask a player what they do and they say "I push in the door" (unless there's a move that applies to opening this door, which depends on the exact circumstances) you just tell them what's on the other side. If what's on the other side might prompt a response from another player, you can just go to that player: <br/><br/>Me: "Okay, you slay the last goblin, the hair on the back of your neck is still on end from the evil aura. What do you do, Castor?"<br/>Dan: "We're in a hurry, so I don't even check for loot, I shove in the door into the ritual room."<br/>Me: "The wooden door swings in, almost too easily, like the ritualatorium wants you to find it. On the other side you see Adarazaz, Omar, you've finally caught up to him. What do you do?"<br/><i>(Dan didn't make a move or anything, but I just followed the flow of action to Isaac, since his character has some bad blood with Adarazaz. We'll get back to Castor after we see what Omar does.)</i><br/>Isaac: "Right where I want him. Is he surprised to see us? Can I Backstab him before he notices?"<br/><i>(Ooops, I didn't actually give enough fictional information. Time to clarify a little, so we know what's happening.)</i><br/>Me: "Well, his back is to you, as his arcane movements stoke the flames of the sacrifical fire..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331031/#Comment_331031" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T14:15:09+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  2:15PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...

Either the PCs are being threatened, or they are not being threatened.<br/>If there's a bunch of gobboes waiting in ambush, that's a threat.  If there's a trap up ahead, that's a threat.  If a character has been poisoned, that's a threat.  <br/><br/>The primary thing you as MC need to do is keep track of all of the threats, which PCs are being threatened (some threats hit everyone), and how much harm each threat does.<br/><br/>Once you have that in mind, you do 1 of 2 things.<br/><br/>1) announce future badness (is the way AW puts it, DW might call it something else).  This means in the fiction describe the situation such that any smart player whose paying attention can figure out that there's a threat of some kind nearby.  Things like "This would be a good place for an ambush", or "after the snake bit you you can feel a burning sensation traveling up your arm".  <br/><br/>That's when you go "What do you do".  The players may then perform a move that allows them to avoid the effects of the threat or do something that fictionally avoids it.  That's fine...there are always more threats.  If they do anything else...nail them with the harm.  Keep nailing them with the harm everytime they do something that doesn't deal successfully with the threat.<br/><br/><br/>2) When you have the opportunity to do a Hard Move (like from a failed roll) spring some threat on them that you haven't announced first.  If the players cry "holy crap that's frickin harsh"...then you're doing it right...that's why its called a Hard Move.<br/><br/><br/>Basically when you're doing a combat you say things like "The gobbo archers are preparing a volley", "the hobbo gobbo is moving around to flank your wizard", "the ogre just ripped a big boulder out of the ground"  You say stuff like that for all of your monsters.  That's your turn.  That's the stuff John's talking about above.  Each of those things is a threat that you need to identify (either scribble it down, or just remember them).  <br/><br/>How much harm does a Gobbo bow do?  If there are enough of them the volley could threaten everyone.<br/>How much harm does the Hobbo do? If nothing stops him, that's the smack down he's going to lay on the wizard.<br/>How much harm does a big frackin' boulder flying out of the sky do (and probably AP to boot)...some fool is going to be eating that harm shortly.<br/><br/>Then let the players decide what they're going to do.  If the paladin moves to intercept the Hobbo and succeeds, great.  That means the Wizard is spared that harm, the hobbo harm is now is targeting the paladin who, depending on what his move was, may eat that harm or manage to avoid it too.<br/><br/>If the ranger dude starts to pepper the ogre with arrows, its possible that one of the effects is to deter the ogre from finishing his boulder hurl.  If the ranger is really successful the ogre might eat harm from the ranger and be unable to attack back, its cool, you can always make more ogres later.  But if the ranger's only partially successful, guess who that wounded and now enraged ogre is going to be flinging that boulder at...Ogre eats ranger's harm, ranger eats ogre's harm.<br/><br/>If the fighter moves to start wailing on the gobbo archers, determine what he does.  if he charges right up at one, he'll probably eat that ones arrow on the way in (trade harm for harm).  If he maneuvers around the flank successfully, he might dish harm without taking any.  If he figures out a way to distract the whole mob of them, he might spare the rest of the party from eating that volley...otherwise...everybody will be getting hit with some nice arrow harm.<br/><br/>Once all the players have gone, announce more badness for your monsters.  Maybe the Hobbo is now gearing up for a massive two handed strike against the paladin (which you've already decided means +2 harm).  Maybe the gobbos keep lobbing arrows.  Maybe the Ogre gives up on the boulder idea and just charges.  Once again figure out the harm and who's threatened by it, and then ask the players what they're doing.  Anyone whose action doesn't involve avoiding that harm...eats it.<br/><br/>Rinse and repeat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331046/#Comment_331046" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T15:47:21+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  3:47PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2011 3:52PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Ralph that's good stuff.

It means "the threat takes effect now." The severity is determined entirely by what's established already in the fiction.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's just not that bad.

We're trying to make that clearer in the text. All of your moves flow from the fiction, especially hard moves. Your moves aren't, like, a list of things to just make happen. They're a list of ways to look at the established situation and pull something out of it to play with. They're fighting goblins with nets, so the thief gets caught and you separate them. The bandit leader has the map, so maybe he yells to his gang to mob the wizard him while he gets away (put someone in a spot).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331077/#Comment_331077" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T19:36:41+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  7:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yeah.

Reading through all the old DW threads didn't relieve much anxiety there because the rules are/were in flux.  I'm all ready with my "Dungeon World is more of a conversation where we take turns, yeah, but we don't really take TURNS as such" spiel, but a couple of the players are more accustomed to games with traditional combat mechanics and I'm concerned they won't react well to this.  <br/><br/>I know I need to be guided by the fiction, but I'm wondering how GMs would typically choose to handle this example situation.  The PCs and some hostile goblins are all next to one another in a small space and the fighter misses his Hack &amp; Slash roll.  I decide to make a monster Move, look to those available to me and select, "Charge!"  Are you generally going to deal damage there or are you going to narrate the attack and deal damage the *next* time someone misses a roll or doesn't do something to otherwise prevent the attack?  I guess that's a general question for all of the monster Moves that suggest some sort of pending damage, like "spring a primitive trap."<br/><br/>I'm very comfortable with my authority and likely choices running AW with a table full of S-G vets but there's something about the combination of a step-on-up genre and some *potentially* less trusting players that unnerves me a bit.<br/><br/>I've absorbed and agree with most of the advice above.  I've even employed it and seen it in action!  I guess I'm wondering what people have seen when playing with others who've never read or experienced a game like AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339061/#Comment_339061" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T13:36:32+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  1:36PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2011 1:38PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played DW for the first time recently (after lots and lots of AW), with Sage running it for a group that included my brother (who hasn't played games in a long time) and somebody new to RPGs.  They were totally fine, but, then again, didn't really have the baggage of turn-taking, unless it was from playing Castle Ravenloft.  Clara (the newcomer) did ask in the beginning, "So how does this work? Do we take turns doing stuff?" but seemed to relax and go with the flow once Sage explained it would be a little more free-flowing than that, based on what was happening in the fiction.<br/><br/>Sage's moves, compared to my previous play of AW, didn't seem all that hard, but that could have been for any number of reasons.  Personally, I would have probably pushed a lot harder, even for new players.  The whole point is triumphing over adversity and making interesting choices, right?  And you can't really do that unless the GM brings the pain, so to speak.  I didn't even end up using any of the Adventuring Gear I'd bought in the beginning, because it never really came to that.<br/><br/>My sense is that "whether to deal damage" is a bad way to think about it.  Try to focus on what your move actually is, fictionally, and then declare the results of what that move is, which could be damage ("spines shoot out from the walls and sink into the side of your face!") or a condition ("your foot's stuck in the trap!") but doesn't necessarily have to be.  Like, going with the trap theme, maybe the ceiling begins to drop, but the players still have time to attempt something before they get crushed.  The damage rules exist so that, when you need to deal damage, you know how to do that, but you shouldn't have to think about them until you need them.<br/><br/>Anyway, just my $0.05, though other folks probably know a lot more about DW specifically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339064/#Comment_339064" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T13:41:10+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  1:41PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2011 1:45PM by sage.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How I'd treat Charge! depends on the situation. It might just mean closing dramatically, getting in close where the goblins have the advantage, while the fighter's been trying to keep them at spear-point. It might mean damage, sure, to one person or more than one. Maybe even a mix: the goblin leads a charge, ending with his dagger in the fighter's gut, the others follow along and get in close (but don't make attacks).<br/><br/>Something I've noticed recently in my GMing of DW: I rarely hand out damage. There's so much other cool stuff going on I usually pick up on something else first (remember, GM moves are just ways of picking an element out of the fiction to work with). I sometimes catch myself: "Oh, I'm working too hard to stretch this, it should just be damage." That's probably overall a good thing: it means my moves are diverse and tied to the situation. I just have to remember that yeah, this is a dungeon too, people get hurt.<br/><br/>My experience, particularly at GenCon, is that even more traditional gamers are pretty cool with it, so long as you tell them up front how it'll be.<br/><br/><b>Edited to add</b>: Jonathan and I are on the same page.

Likewise, if one character draws a hail of arrows, other people could get hurt too.  That's part of what it means to think about the fiction first.  You consider what's happening, tell the players, and then figure out what that means.  Maybe one character takes damage and the others have to Defy Danger to avoid the arrows (or they could decide to just take the damage and do something else instead).  Maybe one character gets lit on fire and needs help from the others to put it out.  Could be any number of things, depending on what the fiction demands.<br/><br/>When I MC Apocalypse World I try to react like this, after I've picked my move:<br/><br/><b>FIRST: Say what's happening, fictionally.</b><br/><br/>"Aw, man, as you turn to hack at the other guy, you catch a crossbow bolt right in the cheek.  Your mouth fills with blood and you have to lean over and let it gush downward just to be able to keep breathing."<br/><br/><b>SECOND: Figure out what that means, mechanically.</b><br/><br/>"So... that's [harm as established], mark that down. And it's Defying Danger to do anything except cough up blood and deal with your situation right now."<br/><br/><b>THIRD: Ask the characters questions, to keep things moving.</b><br/><br/>"So... do you pull the bolt out?  Is anybody else going to do something about this, or are you leaving him to half-drown in his own blood?"<br/><br/>If you handle things this way, what you do mechanically (#2), derives directly from what you said just happened (#1).  So you never have to decide whether you should inflict damage or who you should inflict it to.  Did you say that someone got hurt?  Cool. Then deal damage as established.  This is especially great if -- like me and you and Sage -- the MC tends to be a softy, because you have accountability to the fiction and what you've already said, so you can't weasel out of hitting them as hard as they deserve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339086/#Comment_339086" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T15:21:50+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  3:21PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I know I need to be guided by the fiction, but I'm wondering how GMs would typically choose to handle this example situation.

Are you generally going to deal damage there or are you going to narrate the attack and deal damage the *next* time someone misses a roll or doesn't do something to otherwise prevent the attack?

They are totally going to be able to come at you from all angles and they have reach on you"<br/><br/>Now the fighter is in a tight spot and the threat has increased, Hack and Slash is no longer a viable move right now (they have spears and position) and there is a nice fictional potential for some damage or further mayhem based on what he does next so it keeps the conversation going which may be a good start of the fight. <br/><br/>A harder version of the above move could go like - <br/><br/>"So Angus the Fighter, you are in this cramped and dark corridor right and you are hacking away at the goblins right? In the process of wailing away on them you push them back just outside of your light source. Then from the darkness you hear a voice yell out CHARGE! and a wall of goblins and pointy weapons pours down the hallway knocking you to the ground. They are all over you and you feel your sword start to slip from your grip! What do you do?"<br/><br/>Or you can just go for damage - <br/><br/>"So Angus the Fighter, you are in this cramped and dark corridor right and you are hacking away at the goblins right?

That's where the effects of your hard moves come from, generally.<br/><br/>So, you go, "The goblins rush forward in a mass, spears thrust forward, shrieking, sheer evil hatred burning in their eyes. What do you do?"<br/><br/>(That's the Charge! move. It's not my hard move, it's the thing I say that <b>sets me up</b> for a future, harder move. Like, "take damage from goblin spears and fall down.")<br/><br/>Then, when the Fighter steps up to hack one down as it closes in, and misses his roll, your hard move is obvious. You don't have to invent something or try to judge what's too harsh or whatever. You just follow through on the consequences of the Charge! move.<br/><br/>Also, even when the Fighter steps up and hacks one of them down with a 10+, you still follow through on the Charge! move -- unless a character has interfered with it. There are still 3 other goblins charging. Did anyone do anything about them? No? Then there's your hard move (an opportunity on a golden plate, you might say) so you follow through.<br/><br/>The follow-through means bringing the full effect of your moves to fruition. What's the effect of a mass of charging goblins?

You just follow the fictional logic to the "obvious" fictional result (and then state the "obvious" mechanical ramifications of that: harm, conditions, changing situations, etc).<br/><br/>Really, the more you run AW / DW etc., the more you may find that Vincent's (or Sage's) explicit list of MC moves becomes less necessary to consult every time, because it's already obvious what your hard move is, just from the fiction.  But, starting out or whenever your brain freezes or you get nervous or it's getting late or you've had too many beers or whatever, it's still good to have that list to fall back on, because they are all such great things to do!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339268/#Comment_339268" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T13:37:38+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  1:37PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd read that great blog post several times in May and felt it aligned well with the AW games I'd been running and playing.<br/><br/>I didn't get to run DW last night after all.  One friend brought and was all excited about Quarriors so we ended up making it a card/board game night.<br/><br/>Right now I'm thinking that I can't and shouldn't run DW the way I run AW.  This impression from the degree of opposition represented by equal numbers of opponents, much less a few more, much less a "small gang" worth of goblins.  That and the much higher frequency of combat in DW relative to AW.  I think it's possible that some of the advice above is based more on AW (where I agree with it whole-heartedly) than on DW?  Again, I haven't had the opportunity to run it myself yet.<br/><br/>Beginning AW characters seem more robust/capable in combat relative to likely opposition than beginning DW characters and I've never considered nor seen any MC move to dish out damage to multiple PCs based on one character's miss.  Is the Bloodstone Idol dungeon intended for 1st level characters?  Because I'm thinking it's going to be an absolute meat-grinder.  True?  Intentional?<br/><br/>I'll refrain from further peanut gallery conjecture until I run DW.  Some of my concerns may have more to do with social elements than the combat rules themselves.<br/><br/>By the way, I really love the Bloodstone Idol dungeon's framework, by the way, with it's Dangers and Grim Portents, etc.  Especially the way most of the locations are described such that the nature of the location will be determined by fiction/states leading up to the point where the PCs actually encounter the place.  The text is really tight and seems to solve well any innate friction between "play to find out" and, well, a dungeon.  Parts of it remind me of Judge's Guild's Caverns of Thracia.  I'm going to dig that out of the basement and read it again...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339290/#Comment_339290" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T15:38:43+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  3:38PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John and Jonathan's advice is 100% applicable to DW. <br/><br/>I wouldn't get hung up on an MC move dealing damage to more than one person. Take, say, a sequence of play where the MC (let's talk AW) mentions a cracked bomb that's started beeping. Faster and faster it beeps, but no one can get to it: they're all caught up in the fight. It's a golden opportunity, so BAM it explodes. Of course everyone takes damage, right? That's the only fictional thing that makes sense. If I instead only deal damage to one PC that's kinda odd...<br/><br/>Now replace 'cracked bomb' with 'delayed blast fireball' and you'll see the same thing in DW.<br/><br/>You should run DW like DW, which is very similar to AW in many ways.<br/><br/>If everyone goes in all fighty, the Bloodstone Idol can be a meat grinder, sure. But so much depends on exactly how the GM runs it and how the PCs approach it. Notice that there are no exact numbers on how many of various creatures are there - take that from the fiction. There is no intended level per se, but yeah, it's an adventure to start with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339302/#Comment_339302" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T16:49:08+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  4:49PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 4:50PM by nemomeme.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not second-guessing whether or not I should make Moves consistent with the established fiction.  <br/><br/>Having a bomb or a delayed blast fireball do damage to multiple PCs would be an easy call for me and, I hope, most GMs.<br/><br/>My concern has more to do with calibration of Moves to account for the differences between the two games.

For example, a player asks if there is blankets in the room to cover the fire, or the MC set in his mind that there is an arrow trap in the door without further details, but the PC opens the door kneeling to avoid traps in the face. In many cases, the answer could as well be one or another thing, and it's really important to decide this. How does a MC make the call ? If nothing has been established, it can only be arbitrary.<br/>If the fictionnal situation were totally planned in every detail in the mind of the MC, it could be sensible to talk about such a principle as "say what's happening fictionally" but it's not a possible way of thinking a SIS.

For example, a player asks if there is blankets in the room to cover the fire, or the MC set in his mind that there is an arrow trap in the door without further details, but the PC opens the door kneeling to avoid traps in the face. In many cases, the answer could as well be one or another thing, and it's really important to decide this. How does a MC make the call ? If nothing has been established, it can only be arbitrary.<br/>If the fictionnal situation were totally planned in every detail in the mind of the MC, it could be sensible to talk about such a principle as "say what's happening fictionally" but it's not a possible way of thinking a SIS. There has to be arbitrary call most of the time, and the MC need a guideline for all this occasions.<br/>Am I clear ?</blockquote>\nThe GM/MC makes the call based on their agenda and principles.<br/><br/>Is there a blanket in the room? Well, the GM is portraying a fantastic world (Agenda) and a fan of the characters (Principle). So the GM thinks for a second about what kind of room it is: an orc barracks? A common ale-hall? A dwarven tomb? He's portraying the fantastic world. The orc barracks most likely has blankets, the ale-hall probably does (the Thane's Men sleep there), the tomb not so much. The GM is also a fan of the characters, so if it seems reasonable they say "sure." <br/><br/>Is kneeling going to save the Thief from the trap? The character has implicitly said that they think the arrow hole is at a certain height. If there's established fiction to challenge that the GM should point it out: "As you kneel down you see there's more arrow holes to. Looks like anywhere in front of the door isn't safe. The goblins are pretty short, their traps strike at all heights." (The GM's portraying the fantastic world where goblins make traps, so of course their traps are designed with halflings and such in mind.) <br/><br/>I don't think you're ever really in the situation where "nothing" is established. If the GM doesn't have any clue what kind of room their in to make a call on if there's blankets then something's far more wrong: the GM hasn't even described the room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339455/#Comment_339455" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T11:01:20+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 11:01AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2011 11:02AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Sage said.

Say "yes" or roll the dice -- that kinda thing. Be as positive about their ideas as if they were your own. That doesn't mean don't be reasonable -- if the player wants to do a thing that just can't happen, like jumping across a 100-foot chasm, then "being a fan" isn't going to change that. I'd tell the player that they're <i>positive</i> what they want to do is impossible, and if they want to do it anyway, I'm not going to make them look like a fool for trying (to the best of my ability, anyway). <br/><br/>I've had a GM who depicted nearly every PC failure as ineptitude or idiocy ("Miss? Then you slip in a puddle of gore and fall on your ass -- the orcs guffaw at your clumsiness!"), and derided nearly every PC advantage as worthless or impotent ("The wolf's claws rip through the plates of your mithril armor as if they were so much tissue paper!"), so all I think of is not being like <i>that</i> guy.<br/><br/>So it's not so much giving them everything they want, IMO, as it is being open to their ideas and trying to understand where they're coming from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339877/#Comment_339877" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-21T15:52:12+00:00" title="August 21, 2011  3:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Portraying a fantastic world is the big one for resolving your situations. In a fantastic world, are blankets reasonably found in the location? That's it! <br/><br/>If that means making a judgement call, you have to make that with your principles in mind. You're a fan of the characters in that you're not here to block their ideas. "I didnt mention any blankets so there's none here" isn't really being much of a fan, right? That's not based on the fiction either. "No, the guild doesn't let members sleep in here, no blankets" is fair, you're portraying a consistent fantastic world. "Sure, they probably would, it's winter so there's a pile by what's left of the fireplace, but the flames are between you and them" is totally fine too, you're being a fan who wants to see how they deal with a situation. If you're not sure which one to go with you fall back on being a fan: if you were watching this on TV, would you be more excited to see the characters look for a blanket but not find one, or look for a blanket and see a challenge in getting one? Being a fan totally takes into account not being cheap, like John said. You're a fan of the characters, you don't want to just see them have solutions given to them. <br/><br/>By the way, the moves could serve as guidance here, since the player is looking to you to find out what happens. I'd likely go with "tell them the requirements and ask." I'm fact that's exactly what I did in my example above with the flames between them and the blankets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339892/#Comment_339892" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-21T17:57:19+00:00" title="August 21, 2011  5:57PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2011 8:23AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Plus, there's also creative constraints as well.

I liken the DW conversation first and forefmost to the fantasy fiction your group is into. The mechanics can cope with a wide variety of fictional narratives, they are very robust. The disconnect can come when the conversation is at odds, or when (as Sage and John point out)  someone 'hogs' the narrative limelight. Being a good DM means facilitating this conversation and asking provacative questions so that everyone gets their say, makes their stamp on the fiction in a way that makes sense to them. The moves (especially hard moves handed to you on a golden plate) just flow from great fiction. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis in turn develops great choices for the players. They want to fictionally make this happen (oh and it will on a 10+) but end up rolling a 7-9, so they end up with a difficult choice, having to accept one of many  fictional shifts to their vision. This in turn opens up other players fictional inspiration and the moves 'snowball' from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the OP and combat, I like to ask my players how they want to tackle the fictional representation of the melee? Is it all close in, bloody,g ritty and individual? Or is it more abstract and strategic? What sort of stories do they like to tell? Note that sometimes its more than one fictional 'style' at a time! I had a fighter who was all about individual blows in Hack and Slash, trading Harm for Harm in brutal Joe Abercrombie style prose, whereas the distant Wizard was all cerebral and conflict avoidance (Ie:cowardice), narratively describing his emotional investment and thoughts rather than a gruesome expose of wounds suffered and inflicted.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, I'm not advising anything new, just re-iterating that if you feel a disconnect with DW and old habits of "turn-based combat', just focus on the fiction. Tell a good story first - your story, and the moves and mechanics will not only support folks turns in the conversation, but open up narrative possibilities and twists through failure. Twists that make much more sense because they are rooted in the fiction everyone has detailed, rather than just selecting moves and applying mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339904/#Comment_339904" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-21T21:50:12+00:00" title="August 21, 2011  9:50PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Nathan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
