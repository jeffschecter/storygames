I said off offhandedly, "We could play Houses of the Blooded since that other thread here on Story Games was fresh in my mind."  To my surprise she said, "Sure."  So we went through character creation.<br/><br/>I had created a character for a short-lived play by Twitter HotB game before.  I noticed the same thing here that I noticed there.  Character creation creates little in the way of Situation.  Which is odd since John obviously worked so hard to create a system that produced connected social characters rather than D&amp;D style lone wanderers with no ties.  However, there's nothing like a Kicker or Beliefs or Best Interests.  Despite being connected to other people, the characters have no motion.  On paper, they're not going anywhere and nothing is coming at them.<br/><br/>So you have to read between the lines.  Laura's character had the ritual The Circle, and she has a Court Scholar and she has some Ruins on her property.  Oh and she has a Artifact that lets her define people's futures as well as some Aspects related to that kind of thing.  So, all I have to go on is a vague notion of "The invisible world is important."<br/><br/>So a week after we created this character, we played.  It was not a total disaster but I did find myself "pin wheeling" in a few places.<br/><br/>I had one of the Suaven Laura's character is devoted to show up in a dream and tell her that her cousin (her Contact) was in grave danger.  That his past was catching up to him.  Opening this way felt ridiculously old-school but at least I was drawing from elements on the character sheet and not just making up random relatives the player had never heard of.<br/><br/>I needed seed material so in my head this is what was going on:  In the past Laura's character's cousin had murdered his rival to marry his current wife.  A Spectre was haunting the cousin in the form of the murdered rival.  About mid-way through the session I suddenly had the idea that the cousin's wife might be poisoning him.  I was prepared to change any and all of this based on the result of Cunning and Wisdom wagers but as I said I needed a BASE LINE of content to introduce.  Now, I wasn't working particularly hard to hide any of this content and what I found interesting is that Laura often choose to reinforce and back up my implications with her wagers rather than change direction even though she could have.  In fact, at one point she used a wager to say that the Spectre had, in fact, been deliberately summoned by the cousin's wife which I thought was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Where I really began to pinwheel is when I discovered that so much of the "social drama" laid out in the book is predicated on the social presence of *other ven*.  Throwing Insults only makes sense if you have an audience there to pick up on your subtle implications.  The Duel is a giant formal process involving appealing to others to justify your grievance.  The rules of Hospitality only make sense in the context of multiple ven who might want to harm one another hanging out in the same social space.  Debate is about gaining favor with a political audience.<br/><br/>So much of Ven culture is about ME making YOU look bad to THEM.  In my games (even when there are more than one player) there is no "THEM."  I like intimate scenes with very participants.  So this is how I kept getting tripped up.<br/><br/>Laura's character confronted the cousin's wife alone and out and out called her LIAR and demand she own up to her own plot.  I thought WOW she called a Ven a LIAR in her own HOME.  That can't stand I should....  I should...  wait....<br/><br/>Trading insults doesn't work, there is no audience.<br/><br/>Convening a jury is.... well... over kill and kind of a mood killer as far as the current in progress scene goes.<br/><br/>Revoking Hospitality makes no sense since there isn't anyone else in the house whom you would now be threatened by without the host's Hospitality.<br/><br/>Basically there's no social mechanic for when I want to just grab a character by the collar, slam them against the wall, and scream, "Tell me the truth!"<br/><br/>So I just had the character snarl, say, "How DARE you call me a Liar in my own home!  Get out!  Leave at once!"  And storm out.  Which felt like emotive drama with no teeth.<br/><br/>This happened again later.<br/><br/>Laura decided to take her cousin to a Suaven temple to pray for guidance and salvation.  On the road I had the Spectre materialize and demand that she not interfere with his Revenge.  Again Laura's character stepped forward and demanded that the Spectre reveal to her who is behind manifestations.  And again I was like..... so what happens now.....  I like this idea of this bold ven commanding the Spectre answer to her..... how do we resolve that.....<br/><br/>Here I at least had an idea.  I remembered that things have a Terror score.  So I had Laura roll Courage and I roll Terror.  Each wager adding a fact the Spectre revealed to her.  This was okay.  But felt like I was making up rules as I go along which I hate feeling like I'm doing.<br/><br/>Then Laura says the most amazing thing ever to me.  She wants to use a Ritual to merge the Spectre and her cousin together.  Thus the Spectre gets to live out the life robbed of it and her Cousin is punished for his crimes.  I give her Style.<br/><br/>But... uh... how to handle this.  There certainly isn't a Ritual in the book for that kind of thing.  It felt wrong for Laura's character to suddenly know this Ritual because you have to buy them at character creation and spending a Style to just pile on Sorcerous knowledge in light of the Season actions makes no sense.<br/><br/>And as I've always said I think the rules in the first part of the book get muddied by the rules in the later half of the book.  The following solution I think is 100% in line with the rules outlined in the first part of the book and totally violates several rules and principles in the later part of the book.<br/><br/>First, I had Laura spend a Style to say that her Court Scholar knew of such a ritual.  Laura took her cousin to her rank 2 Ruins to perform the ritual.  So I had her roll Wisdom and gave her 2 dice from her rank 2 Ruins which I think is consistent with the "bonus dice from items" rule.  I also rolled dice for her Court Scholar.  I gave him a Wisdom of 4 and an Aspect about "Things you were not meant to know" or something like that.<br/><br/>We rolled and traded wagers that described the effect of the ritual.  In short her Cousin is now a totally different person.  Neither his former self nor his long dead rival but some weird thing in between.  We ended the session there.  We will probably play more.<br/><br/>So there's my experience playing the game.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254407/#Comment_254407" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T00:57:31+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:57AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting, Jesse.<br/><br/>Your solution to the OMG awesome Ritual seems pretty good for on-the-spot, but it's kind of unfortunate that you had to kludge something together to facilitate a great idea.<br/><br/>No situation on the character sheet: This is (and was, in HotB) so hard for me. "Sure, this character is this and this and can do that, but what do I <i>do</i> with him?" Since playing Houses, I've read Spirit of the Century and the definition and description of Aspects in that book goes a long way toward providing situation for the characters; when bringing them over for Houses I think John left out some of the most important things about Aspects (in expounding upon what and why they are. I'm not talking mechanically. Of course, I think he also just wanted Aspects to be different in HotB, and in so doing made them less effective in some ways).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254418/#Comment_254418" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T02:24:47+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  2:24AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2010 2:32AM by Tanya Fyans.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jesse,<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain I apologise if I become fanboy-ish, and if I ue my own experiences as examples, but several things popped into my head as I read your post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Character creation creates little in the way of Situation.</div>\n</blockquote>\nName, Virtues and Aspects alone should tell you the type of shenanigans the character wants to be involved in.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic name is something to get up to all the time, while secret name if for the finale or pulling out all the stops no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeakness shows you where to hit them or make them stop dead (and if played up can earn Style), while high Virtues tell you what sort of field they want to shine in.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvokes tell you where the player wants the character to win. Tags show where to hit them. Compels show the type of behaviour they want to act up and to bind them in tricky situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe type of Domain they have built and their vassals should also tell you something. When the domain was created did the player name the province, each region and the vassals? Remember if they name them then they get the first three truths, so that is a huge arrow for situations. If they get Trouble in a Region and decide to quell it personally, those three truths and a wisdom risk can give you months of ongoing story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">So I just had the character snarl, say, "How DARE you call me a Liar in my own home! Get out! Leave at once!" And storm out. Which felt like emotive drama with no teeth.</div>\n</blockquote>\nOK, this is easy to think of away from the table, but why didn't you have the cousin-in-law admit the truth to her face, in private, and then leave the character with the onus to go prove it to THEM? Just as the cousin-in-law didn't have an audience to play to, neither did your PC. Oh, and now the cousin-in-law knows she has an enemy to face and will be planning to ruin their reputation first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">So I had Laura roll Courage and I roll Terror. Each wager adding a fact the Spectre revealed to her. This was okay. But felt like I was making up rules as I go along which I hate feeling like I'm doing.</div>\n</blockquote>\nThat is just riffing from the main mechanic of Risk/Wagers to give Truths. Sounds 100% with me, and a nice use of opposing with Terror to boot!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">But... uh... how to handle this. There certainly isn't a Ritual in the book for that kind of thing. It felt wrong for Laura's character to suddenly know this Ritual because you have to buy them at character creation and spending a Style to just pile on Sorcerous knowledge in light of the Season actions makes no sense.</div>\n</blockquote>\nWhy not? If the PC hadn't kept any Season Actions back for this sort of thing, why not give a freebie Season Action for the awesomeness of the story? At the end of the Season they have also developed a rutual for the binding of Spectres - What an Awesome plot-hook for future games (noted for my future characters). The ritual was also story-developed and so may have flaws based upon how it worked in-game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the game sounded great! I would make sure you both talk about the things you liked and the things you want to avoid in future and take it from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know what else to add except my own thoughts on narrating. When I narrate Houses I usually have to hand:<br/>\n* An adventure title with three truths about it.<br/>\n* 4-10 NPC's, each with three truths about them (and nothing else)<br/>\n* A location or two (each with three truths)<br/>\n<br/>\nOften things stay in my toolkit after the first Risk. Othertimes thy are changed wildly from my first thoughts. I maybe have some ideas of how I would like things to go, but on the whole I'm open to the wagers and the style leading the story. If a player states a fact and it is something everyone at the table thinks is cool then they don't spend style. If a player suggests something that keeps in with the game (like tying in the Spectre above) I hand them Style. Anything that makes me smile (esp that vicious smile) gets Style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254475/#Comment_254475" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T09:54:41+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  9:54AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Jesse, <br><br>Quick question about the lack of kickers and the like, did you present a basic situation for the session (like there is a party, show, family gathering, ect) and then have Laura make a roll and some wagers to flush out the situation and add stuff that she wanted to do?

I grew up an only child of a single mother who was the Black Sheep of her family.  The idea of a social gathering as a place to get stuff done is completely alien to me.

Beyond disappointing.<br><br/>The twitter game I was in, I immediately ignored the party context the GM set up and went to the thing that grabbed me most which was the fact that my Contact and I shared a murdered relationship (his sister, my once fiancee).

My sense of HotB is that THAT's the game right there.

In particular I thought the idea of having no locked doors and open public scenes would promote more of a "turn taking" scene framing environment similar to what you see in the Jeepform stuff.<br/><br/>Instead what I discovered is that John has cut away everything EXCEPT the social power playing.  His mechanics get right to the core of that activity.

However, I'm not really interested in the whole Demon thing in this context.  So I took John's own advice to me and went one step further. I wrote my own game: Thornes.<br/><br/>I had one playtest session of it with Alex Duarte and at the end of it he was sweating bullets.  It did exactly what I wanted it to do (unlike Silent Sound <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> ).  Based on that playtest and some initial feedback on the Alpha draft I've revised it and will be bringing it to OrcCon.  I don't know if you're coming this to con or not.<br/><br/>That all said I still want to "get" Houses.  It's just sitting there tickling my brain, all the time and won't go away.

I've had GREAT success Drifting 7th Sea.  Maybe I'm stuck on, "Damn it, I made 7th Sea do I wanted it to do, surely I can do the same with Houses of the Blooded!  They're by the same guy for Christ's sake!"<br/><br/>But in kind of weird perverse way RPG design in the last 5 years or so has improved so much that drifting is actually becoming harder and harder.  I bought Mutant City Blues a few months back hoping I could drift it into something I could use for running a more character centric super powered cop drama..... uh.... turns out the answer is: No.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>So back to the one on one game you and Laura played, here is the big question - minus the little snafu's and system gaps, did you have fun when you played? Did Laura have fun?</blockquote>\nI really like where we ended up.  And I did really like the way the system handled our ritual scene so long as I only paid attention to the first part of the book and closed my eyes and pretended the Sorcery chapter and the Season chapters don't exist.<br/><br/>I think Laura did too.  As I said I think we're going to play again.  I'm not sure Laura likes the "use Wagers to Make Stuff Up" component of the game.  She doesn't like the randomized criminal element in Dirty Secrets and she didn't like a similar element in Serial Homicide Unit.  She's just not really into the retro-justify thing.  So we'll see how that progresses.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255134/#Comment_255134" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T22:49:40+00:00" title="February  4, 2010 10:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2010 10:54PM by noclue.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>However, there's nothing like a Kicker or Beliefs or Best Interests.

This game takes SotC as one of its primary inspirations. It's kickerless as well. I don't think it's a coincidence that you've had some similar struggles with SotC's method of building character from the outside in through aspects. As Colin points out, the player essentially brings those kickers into play through exercising their narrative agency with wagers. No wagers, no kickers, no drama.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>Basically there's no social mechanic for when I want to just grab a character by the collar, slam them against the wall, and scream, "Tell me the truth!"</blockquote>I'm calling bullshit. The problem here is that the character wasn't insulted, she was offended. Insult in Ven culture implies a besmirching of honor that can only take place in public. All of Ven ritualistic justice is socially based and none of it works here. That much is true. When you're alone with another Ven you can't fall back on any Ritual, because Ven only adhere to the cultural rules if they want to or if forced to (generally by the presence of others). So what do you have to operate in private moments like that? You have RISKS:<br/><br/>Physical bullying? Strength v. Cunning, roll. Or maybe you want to make some kind of verbal threat, like they wake up and find themselves dead one night? That's a Cunning risk, probably opposed by either Cunning or Courage, depending. And then there's also the simple Wisdom risk, success here can allow you to start adding details to that liar's character.<br/><br/>Of course, you always can resort to violence and just kill her. Who's going to find out? Prowess!<br/><br/>The ritual thing was awesomeness, btw. Completely awesome and completely by the book as far as I can tell. Spend style to know a thing, makes sense. State intents. Build dice pools. Roll and wager. Where do you think it conflicts with the rules of the latter part of the book?<br/><br/>Now this part is grr...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So I had Laura roll Courage and I roll Terror.  Each wager adding a fact the Spectre revealed to her.  This was okay.  But felt like I was making up rules as I go along which I hate feeling like I'm doing.</blockquote>\nLook at the Contested Risk section. It says, characters state intents and then build dice pools by invoking relevant aspects. So a contested Courage v. Terror Risk with wagers adding facts. Is that somehow not RAW?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>John for a long time was talking about how his LARP was "different" and given all his passion about story and drama and so forth I figured that what he was doing was working to eliminate all that social maneuvering so that we could really get on with crafting a drama about your characters.</blockquote>John's a Diplomacy player for crissakes. Have you watched his videos? He loves social maneuvering. What he doesn't seem to like is folks having lots of cool color going on inside their heads that doesn't impact the game. That and waiting around bored while everyone resolves an hour long Larp combat. As you and I discussed after the Larp, it definitely relies on Player social skills and players who enjoy social venues full of acting and drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255226/#Comment_255226" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T11:44:11+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 11:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey James,<br/><br/>Mulling it over I eventually came to the conclusion that I could use Courage as kind of the "bold presentation of self" stat.  So yeah, Courage vs. Cunning to interrogate a liar seems right.  But I had to mull it over a really long time before I felt "okay" with that.  Don't know what that says about me.<br/><br/>So your conclusions about how I handled the Courage vs. Terror situation the Sorcerous rituals are exactly my point.  They are 100% Rules as Written if you "weight" everything that comes before the Poisons Chapter as "more important" than everything that comes after it.<br/><br/>Terror seems to have some highly specific functions when it is presented.  It's not presented as: "Orks do not have Virtues.  Instead they have Terror.  Whenever an Ork engages in a risk roll it's Terror regardless of the risk at hand."  Terror is instead presented as having a very specific use and function.  No, I don't think it's a stretch or out of the "spirit" of the rules to use Terror in the way I did but it does go against the presentation of Terror's purpose.<br/><br/>That's a bit nit-picky I agree.  My issues with the Sorcery Ritual is less nit-picky.<br/><br/>First Issue:<br/><br/>If ALL Sorcery really is at the end of the day a normal Risk with Wagers being used to describe supernatural facts then why is there a whole chapter dedicated to it?  Why are there individual Rituals with specific mechanics that modify the basic wagers game?  Why do you have to spend points to know individual Rituals?<br/><br/>Second Issue:<br/><br/>It takes a Season Action to learn a new Ritual.  If all I have to do is spend a Style Point to say my Court Scholar knows a given Ritual then what is the purpose of Season Actions?  The book does say you can accomplish a Season Action by making it the focus of an adventure.  Spending a Style point for your Court Scholar to know a given ritual is hardly "the focus of an adventure."<br/><br/>So my issues are (1) I treated Sorcery as normal risk and not as a special subsystem as the book present it as and (2) I allowed the accomplishment of what would otherwise require a Season Action with the expenditure of a Style point.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255252/#Comment_255252" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T14:18:34+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  2:18PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>Jesse, damn skippy.

In fact, as he says on page 422:\n<blockquote><br/>I trust you to change this game to better suit your players. I'm not saying you can ignore the rules, but I am telling you to make the game yours. Stamp it with your own style. Shanri isn't mine. It's yours.</blockquote>\nJesse, I'll grant that allowing her to know the ritual for a style point was a small drift. I think treating it as a normal risk is much like using Bloody Versus in Burning Wheel instead of engaging the fight mechanic. But I do have to ask, what subsystem? I see a bunch of different rituals described which alter the risk-wager mechanic, but they're hardly systematic. A new ritual is just going to be a Risk, with some effects described. In the case of merging a Ven and a Spectre, I might have used a modified version of the Puppet ritual, but its not exactly covered in the list (I don't think the game intends for you to think there aren't other rituals to be discovered).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
