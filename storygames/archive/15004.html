The group usually does this together, and the output is more and more focused on story, instead of building random events that create a life or setting. I'll start of with some examples.<br/><br/>The Blossoms Are Falling (Burning Wheel) has a few different "questionnaires" depending on the framework of the game the group is interested. Most, if not all, the questions also add game elements to character sheets, such as relationships.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age has oracles which randomly determine seed ideas for the story at hand. It can be interpreted very loosely, but it's just concrete enough.<br/><br/>Diaspora uses random generation to determine some big variables, and each player takes on filling in the details. There isn't much direct story connect (IIRC) but I still count it because it's not one person doing the world building alone, and the act of doing as a group builds ownership. (In contrast to many games of the 80's or 90's where random tables seemed to be more about idea generation for the GM, without concrete ties to a group story).<br/><br/>What other games do this, and what do you think of how successful they are at getting a game started and helping to create interesting stories?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341083/#Comment_341083" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T12:56:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2011 12:56PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played Microscope?<br/><br/>(And knowing you're a local -- at least, at the moment -- I'd be down to show you if you haven't played.)<br/><br/>It's history-building played out, rather than a questionnaire made for another game.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341085/#Comment_341085" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T12:59:45+00:00" title="August 31, 2011 12:59PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No!

The first session is a dedicated group worldbuilding night, where you decide on the broad concept and genre of your game, then drill down to establish the finer details - history, geography, tech levels, magic, relevant factions, and ongoing conflicts. Then you start talking about character ideas and set the dial for how realistic the world is (trademark scope) and how important the characters are within it (power level), both of which have a mechanical impact on character creation. Then you talk about potential adventure ideas, create the supporting cast, create the opening scene, and finish off the PCs (including defining a temporary 'prologue' ability to introduce you to the story, and creating a preliminary NPC for you to talk to during the session). There's a lot of story-emphasis throughout the whole process. <br/><br/>I've set up four campaigns so far using this method (a cyberpunk game, a victorian horror game, a WW2 zombie apocalypse game, and an epic fantasy saga with a 'four elements' theme) and it's worked out well every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341130/#Comment_341130" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T18:21:18+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  6:21PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2011 6:21PM by stefoid.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My game concentrates on character building rather than world building.  <br/><br/>Probably though, its too much character creation in a vacuum.

Maybe some kind of questionaire or good old fashioned random table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341135/#Comment_341135" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T19:49:44+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  7:49PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the map creation part of On Mighty Thews count?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341136/#Comment_341136" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T20:11:46+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  8:11PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zircher</cite>Does the map creation part of On Mighty Thews count?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely.<br/><br/>Also Burning Empires...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341140/#Comment_341140" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T20:34:20+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  8:34PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Steve">@Steve</a>:<br/>I think you need to give an amount of setting information inverse to how much direct authority the players have over the game.
