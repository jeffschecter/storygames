That's not likely to break anything, and will actually make your character a source of Key scenes, essentially. On that note, perhaps I'd do something like this a bit differently, by allowing the player to determine Key scenes before each session. This is mostly because those xp rewards seem a bit large for situations that are basically external to the character himself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174828/#Comment_174828" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T17:15:10+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  5:15PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen Judd's 1st Quest document, and wrote him about it but never heard back.

For example the "Wolverine" type character, "the loner with a good heart" is notoriously popular, and notoriously disastrous.  I can see this as a really cool way to flag how you want your character to work in the group.<br/><br/>I think the buyoffs are the tricky part.  Graham's "Reverse Key of the Casanova" is perfect, but he screwed up the "Reverse Key of the Bastard".  The buyoff should be "Express genuine sympathy for a PC".<br/><br/>There's a problem with how these are phrased though.  They should be concrete actions that other characters can perform for XP.  For example:<br/><br/><b>Reverse Key of the Lovable Rogue</b><br/>1xp: Forgive this PC for a minor transgression<br/>3xp: Get this PC out of serious trouble.<br/>Buyoff: Be rescued by this PC.<br/><br/>Or something.  The buyoffs are still wonky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174879/#Comment_174879" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T05:23:45+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  5:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2008 5:24AM by jenskot.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We playtested 1st quest and reverse keys in conjunction with standard keys worked perfectly for us.

Pretty much every version I've seen, not only in 1st Quest, but also all the examples above, are really hard to understand. Who gets XP when... who, huh? It's easy to get confused. So I'm being extra careful about the phrasing here.</i>\n<blockquote><b>Key of the Casanova</b> (Judd-style, at least as far as I understand his idea)<br/><br/>Gain:<br/><br/>1 XP each time you flirt with someone.<br/>2 XPs each time you successfully seduce someone.<br/>5 XPs each time you risk life and limb to pursue a romantic interest.<br/><br/>Award another player:<br/><br/>1 XP when they help you pursue a romantic interest.<br/>3 XPs if they pursue one of your romantic interests themselves.</blockquote>\nAnother thought I had was preparing the "reverse" elements in some form that the other players can see. In this case, you'd have the first (regular) part on your character sheet, and leave something like this on the table, for the other players to refer to:\n<blockquote><b>Key of the Casanova</b> - [character name]<br/><br/>Gain:<br/><br/>1 XP when you help me pursue a romantic interest.<br/>3 XPs if you pursue one of my romantic interests yourself.</blockquote>\nI think careful use of pronouns (you, they, me, etc) is key in making such Keys (ahem) read clearly to everyone at the table.<br/><br/>(edited for formatting)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174961/#Comment_174961" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T14:06:28+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  2:06PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>Essentially, with the Reverse Keys, as you call them, the other players get 1 XP for helping you with that goal and 3 XP for getting in your way in a manner that forces you to be even more what the key is about.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175087/#Comment_175087" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T12:29:59+00:00" title="October 15, 2008 12:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, absolutely!
