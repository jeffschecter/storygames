Maybe a sans-serif font.  Different color perhaps.  Bigger.<br/><br/>The body text seems thin and weak.  Maybe that's just me.  Maybe the font size should be bumped up a point?  Not sure what's causing that.<br/><br/>I don't know about the header numbers. "6.4 Battle Cry" might look better as just "Battle Cry" but bolder and in color.<br/><br/>Some nice graphic flourishes to tie things together might be nice.  Like something bold and thematic in/under/as the chapter titles.<br/><br/>I'm worthless.  That's all I've got.<br/><br/>As an alternative, find something good and copy that (without, you know, "copying" it).<br/><br/>I'm horribly unreliable, but I'd be glad to offer some help.

I think the biggest problem is that your choices of font say something like "formal, classic" rather than relating to your subject matter. Take a look at the free fonts on blambot.com, which you can use in non-profit projects like this. The key thing is to give it some character without compromising readability, which can be a tricky balancing act. But I would definitely go with something that looks hand-drawn for the main headers, and something no more formal than a sans for the main text. If you can find a hand-drawn-looking font that allows pages of text to be read in comfort then great, but that might be asking too much.<br/><br/>It would also be nice if your page layouts did more to reference the imaginative use of frames in many comic books, but I know even less about layout than I know about type, so I'll shut up at this point. Hopefully you'll get better advice than mine sooner rather than later!<br/><br/>Edit: That thing about the body text looking weak? Some fonts out there on the web are poor digitisations of print fonts. They tend to have many problems, but one of them is that metal type printing spreads the ink slightly as it impacts the page. If a digital font adaptation doesn't allow for this, the result will look weedy, especially in PDF form. That might be what's going on here.

We've been playing it since 2009, so I'm pretty happy with how the game works, but I could use feedback on how well the manuscript explains the game.  E.g. does it need more examples, are particular parts unclear or too wordy, that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Dave">@Dave</a> Hallet<br/>\nThe font is Latin Modern Roman (I think it's Adobe's version of it, or else Adobe embedded it without my having to tell it to).  I can change that, I suppose, but I don't really know what would be better (and it has to be something that Adobe can embed...not sure what the rules on that are).  E.g., here's a link to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://db.tt/qrEyKQMx" rel="nofollow">Kapow! in Palatino</a> instead of Latin Modern Roman.   Does that look better?  Not to me, but I don't have any trouble with the other, which I think kind of looks elegant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see maybe using one of the Blambot comic-style fonts for headers, but I think the whole book set in a whimsical font would make people's eyes bleed...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347930/#Comment_347930" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T05:15:52+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  5:15AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2011 7:07AM by Dave Hallett.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I'm hoist by my own petard here, as Latin Modern Roman is one of the fonts that Font Squirrel recommends! I still think it looks a bit light on the page, but oh well. No, I don't think Palatino is a big improvement. It's maybe slightly less formal, but it still has the classic look I'm talking about. I agree it's an elegant font, in the vein of Garamond, say, but I don't know why you're striving for "elegant" here.<br><br>I agree that you won't get a Blambot style font to work for the main text: in fact, I thought I said that. Maybe not clearly enough. Try something like Museo Sans. Here's a quick mock-up. Having done it, I'm not so keen on Blambot fonts. They don't play nicely with Word, but I can't be bothered to fire up InDesign just for this.<br><br>Anyway, if you don't like it, that's fine, I'm not that sold on it either! But I think it shows that Museo Sans could work for you to look clear but less formal, and shows the basic idea of having some contrasting, more "comic book" for headers and pull quotes. Ignore the layout, which is obviously dull. I haven't even adjusted the leading.<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1389624/The%20Primary%20Rule.pdf" rel="nofollow">Quick sample text</a><br><br/>At the end of the day, the only thing is to try playing around with stuff and find out what works.

I like rules lite ... number of actions and movement ranges and different dice for different power levels make my eyes glaze over ... so there, I'd suggest treating me like a lobster ... slowly boil the water instead of dropping me straight in the hot. Give me a much smaller set of core, basic rules (all you really need to play is <i>this</i>) and then have exceptions to the rules baked into character sheets (like Apocalypse World moves) and make rules about range bands and bonus actions etcetera be 'optional' and 'advanced' ... because once you have the Primary Rule, I'm not sure you need the range bands: <br/><br/>"I punch him in the face with my Unbreakable Fists."<br/>"But you're on the next rooftop over - does that really make sense for the genre?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348155/#Comment_348155" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T19:55:12+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  7:55PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first impressions: I really disliked the cover illustration. I was tempted to stop right there, but I didn't want to literally judge a book by its cover so I tried to see what the text was like. The first page comes across as a wall of text, and scrolling down gives me the impression that the entire game is like that. It seems like it would be tiring to read. I think your combination of font size and column width is putting too many words on a line. If I were you I would try different page layouts to get shorter line lengths -- if you want to stick to an 8 1/2 by 11 page size you could try a 2-column landscape layout (it gives an effect very similar to a digest-sized book). I would probably also put blank lines between the paragraphs and lose the paragraph starting indentations so that the pages were a bit easier on the eyes. (Also, watch out for paragraphs spanning page transitions -- the two lines of a paragraph at the bottom of the first introduction page look kind of sloppy to me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/majyc" title="majyc"><img alt="majyc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u292/jamused/smaller-books.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/majyc">majyc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348187/#Comment_348187" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T07:25:47+00:00" title="November  7, 2011  7:25AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">@jdfristrom</a> Not out of bounds at all.

If you look at the visual impact your text blocks are giving, I'm getting the impression that you're trying to cram as much text into a space as possible rather than prioritizing experience of the reader:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/KapowPage.png"/><br/><br/>In the text I've read so far, there's definitely some editing that can be done that would both tighten up the writing and cut your wordcount. For example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kapow</cite>Kapow! is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">designed to be</span> simple enough for novices to play</blockquote>\nI also don't really understand the point of giving an overview of the dice mechanic in the introduction. Why not use the introduction to introduce the game, and explain the rules in a section devoted to explaining the rules? The current text made me feel like it was wasting my time, since it wasn't explaining it in enough depth that it would be useful to me but was also keeping me from getting to the meat of the game.<br/><br/>(Hopefully I'm not coming across as too harsh.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348214/#Comment_348214" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T11:12:29+00:00" title="November  7, 2011 11:12AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just taking a stab here, but is this layout done in Latex? I've tried doing good design layout in Latex before and it's really tough. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of it for certain uses, but even when trying to be creative it always reads as an ACM paper to me.<br/><br/>I also think you need to up your leading and mess with your justification settings.<br/><br/>The art also was turning me away. Maybe mess with something indicative of comics, but not relying on much artistic skill? Inset sound effects or speech balloon shapes if you have to. Or find public domain work and use it.<br/><br/>As for the rules, I had the same response as Jamie: You had me sold with the first two concepts, but then the detail just slowed me down.<br/><br/>Maybe one solution would be to make multiple, more focused games? Right now Kapow! is about all kinds of superheroes, which means you have to spend a lot of time on different scopes, examples, etc. and the text can't carry much flavor. Maybe if there was Kapow: Vigilantes and Kapow: Galactic or whatever instead each one could be shorter, more focused, and with more flavor. The Vigilanties one can have text written in nearly-noir style, while Galactic is full of space-bending strangeness. It could all still be the same PDF: cover the rule of three and the Primary rule first, then have a chapter each for making characters in each style, then the resolution system.<br/><br/>Overall it feels like you started with this wonderfully clear concise core then accumulated stuff around it and not all of that stuff needs to be there. I'm completely behind the two core concepts, but had trouble beyond that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348221/#Comment_348221" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T11:56:53+00:00" title="November  7, 2011 11:56AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got some super clip art for sale here:  <br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=93855" rel="nofollow">example of superhero art 1</a><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=95432" rel="nofollow">example of superhero art2</a><br/><br/><br/>And I do lots of superhero art for publishers all the time.
