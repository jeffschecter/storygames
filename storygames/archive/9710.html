It was awesome and one of the highlights of my Go Play NW that Eric, Matthew, James and I just sat down and threw down.<br/><br/>Set in a quasi-military space station on the edge of black hole, the station is powered by an Entropy Engine (that makes nothing). It was a straight Aliens-esque movie complete with weaselly company man, Mr. Filman (Steve Buscemi) and grizzled old head of security (Michael Ironside), obsessed scientest (Joaquin Phoenix), noble doctor who turned out to be a spy, Anne, and last but not least 1st officer Chip! whose name was more memorable to me than his actor. In the end it was the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">station mechanic (Katee Sackhoff)</span> <b>correction per Eric</b>: obsessed scientest Dr. Owen Fields, the security guy and first officer, Chip!, who fed Mr. Filman to the menace by leaving him locked up in the brig and taking off in the last shuttle as the space station fell into the black hole.<br/><br/>Playtest Stats:\n<ul><li><a href="http://plays-well.com/geigerdraft.pdf" rel="nofollow">March 2008 Alpha Edition of Geiger Counter</a></li><li>Employed the "draw quasi spacially realistic" settings idea</li><li>We used little name chits that had the name and role of the characters and marked survivors clearly. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6344" rel="nofollow">Our local group started doing this</a> because the characters are generated to fill some sort of role, often stereotype, in the setting so that's how we remember them, not as "Anne" vs. "Natasha".

Great facilitation, and, man, good times.<br/>Mr. Filman was a blast to play, it was so much fun to revel in his weaselly troublemaking.

Listing a bunch of character concepts as a group (with lots more characters than players), then picking survivors, then picking who will play those characters (Alpha-style) promotes a very different attitude than sitting down and making "my guy" (Beta-style). That influences the whole rest of the game. I think it's a critical part of the Geiger Counter magic.<br/><br/>When you get to Seattle we'll all drink vast quantities of coffee and talk about Geiger Counter long into the night.

I think part of the process of playing is to figure who amongst the survivors (or red shirts for that matter) emerges as interesting. We don't know until we start playing and it makes total sense that on average maybe 1 key and interesting survivor per player emerges from their pile of PCs (I'd have to look through the previous games summaries to figure out if this is the case), but figuring out who that turns out to be is the fun part. We want to discover who the real stars of the movie are. I didn't see it coming when Steven Segal got blown out of the airplane hatch at the beginning of Executive Decision either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215869/#Comment_215869" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T17:34:43+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  5:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.  this was a total blast, and really played well.

I have not carefully read the Beta draft as Ben has and just glanced at it now, but if indeed you dropped specifically creating minor characters and creating a pile of 10-12 characters in favor of the "my guy" approach, that's definitely not as good.** Another part that looks to be optional in Beta are the actors, and I think this should be a mandatory step as it is in the Alpha. <br/><br/>At the GPNW game, James said something I felt was a very good point, that the set up, while longer than some other games is not only fun, but serves the purpose to quickly ramp up the story in what otherwise might be several sessions of backstory and learning about characters. This careful prep allows you to dive right into the movie and have it move along and get to where it's going in one session - missing any piece and you don't get that.<br/><br/>**EDIT: It's because if as in the Beta, you suggest the mooks should be cast and described when they are introduced, that kind of undercuts the drama of having them killed by the menace, as if they were just invented on the spot to die. The drama of their death comes in the part where they _could_ have been survivors, but they weren't destined to be one of the chosen ones. Ben made this same point in his <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7348&amp;page=1#Comment_164324" rel="nofollow">earlier post</a> and it's definitely true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215900/#Comment_215900" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T20:46:06+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  8:46PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, prep time is definitely something I've been working on cutting down with each edition, but it requires almost as much as Primetime Adventures, say, and then is meant for running one-shots, which is an interesting space to work in.<br/><br/>What's also interesting is that I wrote the two editions, Alpha and Beta, at very different times in my life and play history (I'd played the game 3 times for Alpha, and 12+ for Beta), but I don't really consider them to be different games so much as different explanations of the same family of techniques and practices.  So it's really interesting, then, that one edition seems to emphasize certain aspects while another edition emphasizes others. I don't know if the way I ran it changed (because it's slightly different each time, right?) or if I just explained it differently or what.<br/><br/>Partially for this reason, I've been considering just writing Gamma as one giant example of play, to show people how to play the game instead of telling them, but it would have to be a really good example for it to be worth reading all the way through, almost like a good novel or movie script, and I'm nervous that I might not be up to it.  Then again, the great thing about Geiger having multiple editions -- and not being released commercially in print until I'm fully satisfied with it -- is that I could write and release an edition (as I did with Beta) and just see what folks think of it and how helpful the text is when trying to run the game.<br/><br/>But yes, we should definitely all sit around and some point and talk about what the essentials of the game are and how best to convey them in a text to people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216059/#Comment_216059" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T14:18:47+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  2:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2009 2:19PM by John_Powell.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<cite>Posted By: ping</cite><blockquote><br/>I didn't see it coming when Steven Segal got blown out of the airplane hatch at the beginning of Executive Decision either.</blockquote>\nI cheered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216273/#Comment_216273" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T15:09:04+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  3:09PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2009 11:23PM by ping.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I've been considering just writing Gamma as one giant example of play, to show people how to play the game instead of telling them</blockquote>My gut reaction is that this is not a good idea, having just recently facilitated the game completely spontaneously without reading the rules for a year. I read the steps out loud as we did them and I thought the procedural Step 1: Do X, Step 2: Do Y was a big part of why the game was so smooth. I'm curious what Eric, Matthew and James who (as far as I know) had never read the rules thought about the game set-up being very procedural.<br/><br/>If we had to interpret the rules from a play example, it would not only take longer (and the idea is that this is supposed to be a spontaneous one-shot), but I'm not convinced it would be clearer EDIT: and the core rules would not function as a reference which is one of its primary jobs. I think people want to be told how to play. They will always do whatever they're gonna do, but at the onset, they need to be told without ambiguity how to play the game out of the box. I have thoughts about how the procedures might be clarified or re-arranged, but I think you should keep it as you have it in Alpha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216280/#Comment_216280" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T16:02:33+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  4:02PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true. My goal with Alpha was to write up the procedures as if it was a board game and Beta drifted away from that slightly, in an attempt to clarify some things and also because Geiger isn't mechanically exact like board games are (requires freewheeling implementation of procedures).  I think a "example of play" text might be good at teaching readers how to play, but it would be much worse at teaching them how to teach other people (which is critical).

The above sound to me more like playing tips that you put after the core rules. The core rules and game set up can be very crisp and procedural to get the game to the point where people can play. The style and pacing advice can be a separate chapter that would be prudent to read, but not necessary for understanding the mechanics of play. These you can illustrate with longer examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
