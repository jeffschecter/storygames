I'm asking you guys.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Have any of you read any of the SAS ebook thingees that White Wolf is selling?  If so, can you share your opinion of them?<br/><br/>it's been my belief for awhile that the new changeling is pretty freaking rad (and based on this year's ennies, i'm not the only one who thinks so) and i've been thinking of trying to bring it to the table sometime in the next couple months and i was considering maybe getting the changeling SAS dealie.  the concept of the SAS (from the very vague way the webpage describes it) sounds interesting, but having never seen one, I'm having trouble determining if it's really worth the cash or whether it will work for my situation.<br/><br/>So yeah.  Has here on SG actually seen/read one?<br/><br/>thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168408/#Comment_168408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T20:47:22+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  8:47PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're basically brief, well-written modules.

That is the root of something really cool (what if a GM only had a certain number of dots to spread around into that system?) but it doesn't really go anywhere special.<br/><br/>The quality of the modules is uniformly good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168423/#Comment_168423" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T00:23:44+00:00" title="September 11, 2008 12:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And for the record, despite it's flaws, Changeling the Lost does indeed rock. I've been in a Camarilla Changeling LARP for the past year and I love it, though I can see how much better it could be on the tabletop.<br/><br/>The books for Changeling are good too, though there are clear signs that they couldn't really make up their minds about the rules half the time. They keep releasing revised or optional systems to do things that you could already do from the core book, or putting a merit in one supplement and then another version of it in the next supplement because the first one wasn't tested enough or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168461/#Comment_168461" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T05:33:41+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  5:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought a couple of them, just to see what WW's system is.  They are an interesting experiment in trying to figure out how to write modules for WW games, which is much harder than writing them for D&amp;D.  The problem with modules for WW is that, unlike d20 fighty stuff or dungeon crawls, you can't just throw down a bunch of monster stats and a map.  In the end, though, I don't find the SAS stuff to be really satisfying, though clearly JD disagrees.<br/><br/>Basically, the way they work is, instead of a dungeon with branching paths or whatever, you have a series of locations for scenes to take place in, with various NPCs and such in each location for the characters to interact with.  Since you won't always be fighting these NPCs, each location also has mechanical guidelines for other major important things you might want to do in that location/scene, like investigation rolls or trying to get information out of someone or using magic powers to do various things etc.  Each roll critical to the scenario is given a difficulty and some special guidelines.  The locations are linked together by an overall situation.  Sometimes there's an obvious order in which to progress from one to another, but sometimes the players have more freedom in which order to play out different scenes or go to different locations.  Sometimes there's even mechanical or story-based consequences for not doing certain things or taking too long.<br/><br/>Honestly, I would prefer WW to move more towards the kinds of situation generators that you see, for example, in the way towns are constructed in Dogs in the Vineyard, showing people how to construct interesting, open-ended situations instead of providing very specific modules and scenarios.  Teach a man to fish, etc.  But, as a way of adapting the traditional D&amp;D module structure to WW, I don't think they're a bad attempt at all.  They are certainly much more helpful than previous attempts.  Still, I think if I was attempting to work off a module, I'd read it, grab some of the parts that look especially cool, and then just make the rest up off the top of my head.  Maybe that's what WW expects GMs to do, since that's frequently the way they expact folks to approach their mechanics.  I'm not sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168470/#Comment_168470" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T07:07:06+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  7:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the good stuff has been said, so I'll just throw in a general thumbs up for them (and for Changeling, which is fantastic).<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168543/#Comment_168543" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T15:07:07+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  3:07PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2008 3:27PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Honestly, I would prefer WW to move more towards the kinds of situation generators that you see, for example, in the way towns are constructed in Dogs in the Vineyard, showing people how to construct interesting, open-ended situations instead of providing very specific modules and scenarios.

I agree there are some problems (aren't there always a few?) with both the core rules and the other books, but I'm convinced it's absolutely the best of the New WoD (though I haven't read the new Hunter yet).  I'm especially interested in seeing what they did in Equinox Road for rules for playable True Fae.  at the moment I have trouble believing they could have created a more appropriate system for playing beings of myth and madness than Exalted: Fair Folk but maybe it's more playable than I found that one.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168622/#Comment_168622" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T07:50:26+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  7:50AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Just how flexible (or unflexible) are they?
