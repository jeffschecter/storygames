We'll be playing Day of Defeat (which you own if you bought the Orange Box and is otherwise ten bucks) as well as some Battlefield 2 and Left 4 Dead.<br/><br/>DOD:S meekmok-west.gotdns.org:27315<br/>L4D   meekmok-west.gotdns.org:27415<br/>BF2   meekmok-west.gotdns.org Default Port<br/><br/>Meet on Steam.  The plan is to play BF2 until we hit 6 people then DOD:S<br/><br/> 2:00 PM -  6:00 PM EST, then 6:30 PM - 10:00 PM EST.  <br/><br/>Whisper me for the server password; we'd love to see you there and shoot you in the face.  If you are local to Carrboro, NC, it's possible to join us locally as well.  <br/><br/>--Jason                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
