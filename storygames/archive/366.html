                    What do I need to do to be part of the Indie Games Explosion at Gen Con<br/>
<br/>
Gen Con has changed their Event Registration process for this year.  For a Sponsor or Gaming Group (Like Indie Games Explosion) One person needs to act as Event Organizer-the EO)<br/>
<br/>
The Event Organizer needs to register all the events for the organization.  <br/>
<br/>
A number of Complimentary badges will be awarded according to how many player Hours of Gaming the Organization is doing as a whole.  One badge for every 96 Player Hours.  (the equivalent of 4 events run for 4 hours for 6 people.)<br/>
<br/>
Shifts as Table Custodian for The Games on Demand Table will figure in as well.  Each shift will be 4 hours and be open for 8 people. 1 shift = 32 Player hours.  3 shifts is enough for a badge.<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve asked for Long tables rather than round tables for the Games on Demand figuring that 2  Indie games of  four people can run at the same table. <br/>
<br/>
If you decide you want to be part of the Games explosion I need a few important bits of information:<br/>
<br/>
I need your full name to give you credit as GM.<br/>
<br/>
I need to know the game your are running, the title of the scenario and a brief description: (max. 450 characters.  Keep it about 50 words)<br/>
<br/>
I need to know when you want to run the Game.  <br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
Name: Michael S. Miller<br/>
Game: With Great Power<br/>
Title: League of Their Own<br/>
Description: You do have the suit, the powers and the love of the city, everything a hero needs except a license.  The city is being preyed on by villainy. If you act with out the license you may save the day at your own peril, but if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t who will?<br/>
When:  Thursday 7pm-11pm, AND Friday 8am-12pm, <br/>
<br/>
Game: Dogs In The Vineyard<br/>
Title: Annie Get Your Gun<br/>
Description: There is Great Desperation in the Town of Homefields since the Carnival came to town to stay.  Fewer and Fewer of the faithful are showing up at Service.  ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a blight on the Crops a draught on the land and they say the Devil himself prowls the hills at night, picking up the unwary.  Send in the Dogs.<br/>
<br/>
When: Sunday 10am.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to set all games at <br/>
Age : 13+<br/>
Experience:Young Players (Rules are taught)<br/>
Difficulty Rating: Easy<br/>
<br/>
If you would rather mature players only (18+)<br/>
And an Average or Hard difficulty let me know.<br/>
<br/>
GAMES ON DEMAND shifts.<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to be able to have These Shifts all Filled with Table Custodians.<br/>
Thursday 10am-2pm<br/>
Thursdays 2pm-6pm<br/>
Friday 10am-2pm<br/>
Friday 2pm-6pm<br/>
Friday 6pm-10pm<br/>
Saturday 10am-2pm<br/>
Saturday 2pm-6pm<br/>
Saturday 6pm-10pm<br/>
Sunday 10am-2pm<br/>
<br/>
Table Custodians may or may not get to actually run games.  My hope is that people will be ushered to the Games on Demand Table and the Custodian can offer the Games he wants to run. Also if There is a situation with a gm and willing players at the booth they can go to the Games on Demand table.  The Custodian will collect Generic tickets per player.  Kept organized together in a packet IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll provide and passed on to the next Custodian.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be collecting all the paperwork and getting the necessary signatures and such.<br/>
<br/>
Who gets the Complimentary Badges?<br/>
Anyone who does the 96 player hours and wants one will get a badge.  If you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do 4 events of 6 people or 5 events of 5 people or 3 GoD shifts, but you still need a badge PM me and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see what I can do.<br/>
<br/>
OH!  Gen Cons deadline is April 7th, but they are assigning stuff first come first served and are warning that space might be an issue.  So I will be Registering Indie Games Explosion Events Wednesday March 22 to give us plenty of time for Gen Con to put our games all in the same room.<br/>
<br/>
Thus I need the Event Info (Name, Game, Description, When,) as soon as possible<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m posting this up on My blog:  http://imogena.livejournal.com/<br/>
and to TheForge Conventions forum: http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19064.0<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone who has responded so far.  <br/>
if you have any questions let me know and I'll try and answer them.<br/>
