Lulu is still top dog and even places like Rapid POD (with its horrible history of customer service) are better known than Amazon is for POD products and services. Frankly, Amazon missed its window of opportunity here and relegated itself to the status of total unknown (with regard to POD services) by failing to make up for its ultra-late entry in the field with organized advertising and promotion. So Amazon isn't going to sell new POD books from other publiahers anymore. Who cares? Who is selling a significant number of their POD books as new product through Amazon now? Who is buying a significant number of POD books through Amazon? My guess is that the answer to all three of these questions, at the current time, is "<i>Nobody</i>". This might change, someday, but that day has not yet come. <br/><br/>[Edit: Note that people other than Amazon sell actual products <i>through</i> Amazon. This boycott appears to apply to new Amazon sales only, not products offered by third parties <i>through</i> Amazon. Knowing that the typical Amazon warehouse only orders about two to five copies of any new product on average and that this boycott doesn't prevent third party Amazon sellers from offering non-Amazon POD books for sale, I don't see that this is any huge deal.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137016/#Comment_137016" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T13:02:35+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  1:02PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Frankly, Amazon missed its window of opportunity here and relegated itself to the status of total unknown (with regard to POD services) by failing to make up for its ultra-late entry in the field with organized advertising and promotion.</blockquote>\nI have a friend who for a time worked at a big POD service consisting of four letters.  If I remember correctly, Amazon contacted them about two years or so ago, saying "Hi, we'd like to buy your operation!"  When they said no, Amazon's response was (essentially) "OK, then fuck you! We'll do POD anyway, and totally bury you in two years."<br/><br/>It's been two years, and no burying has been done. But it looks like the Amazon Undertaker is just getting his shovel warmed up for Phase One of the burying. It's not going to be nice or pretty, what Amazon will be doing next to ensure they're the top dog.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137026/#Comment_137026" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T13:57:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  1:57PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2008 1:58PM by jdrakeh.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>But it looks like the Amazon Undertaker is just getting his shovel warmed up for Phase One of the burying.

Services as opposed to products are funny in that regard -- often the first one with their foot in the door will be Top Dog until the day that a new service makes the entire industry obsolete. Assuming that they aren't introducing a true alternative to current POD operations in the form of a new medium or distribution model, the only move that they could make to <i>possibly</i> clench their superiority is forbidding third party sellers to resell non-Amazon POD books. <br/><br/>I don't see restricting third party sellers as smart move -- most third party sellers don't have the manpower or much incentive to comply with such an order when sites such as eBay pose no such restrictions on third parties. In my estimation,.such a move would be more likely to drive the creation of a new entity that functions like Amazon once did, rather than egender loyalty amongst current Amazon third party sellers or attract new ones. I just can't see any way that such a decision wouldn't blow up in Amazon's face. The one final possibility is that Amazon could introduce a totally original POD medium or distribution model. <br/><br/>Maybe. . . an e-book distribution model. <br/><br/>As Amazon is already manufacturing and marketing their own e-book  reader (which cost some serious money), I think that this is the most likely possibility. I predict a heavy investment in creating the RPGNow equivalent of non-RPG book distribution with a secondary emphasis on POD. While it won't be direct competition in terms of POD service, the perceived crippling of the Amazon market by refusing to carry any new, non-Amazon, POD products coupled with a multi-million dollar push to move the entire self-publishing market into a different medium might just put Amazon on top of the pile at the end of the day. It's CDs versus audio cassettes for books, baby. <br/><br/>On one hand, that sucks for people using the current POD model as their primary source of income. OTOH, it migth make books hip again and that's way fucking cool. Of course, this is all pure speculation (albeit speculation based on current economic and societial trends). If I was running Amazon, these are the avenues that I would be exploring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137028/#Comment_137028" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T14:10:53+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  2:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is another take on this<br/>\nI came across it earlier today<br/>\nI for one, do not like how it appears to me<br/>\nEven if I am not a publisher, or an author, just a writer<br/>\nI dislike the implications and one more slam on the midlists making them even more impossible to survive in <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.writersweekly.com/the_latest_from_angelahoycom/004597_03272008.html                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137029/#Comment_137029" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T14:14:53+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  2:14PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>Who is buying a significant number of POD books through Amazon?</blockquote>\nWhile it may not be a major avenue in the indie games community, the link earlier in the thread suggests it's a big deal to small press fiction writers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137038/#Comment_137038" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T14:54:08+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  2:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>Who is selling a significant number of their POD books as new product through Amazon now?</blockquote>\nI was sort of wondering that myself.
