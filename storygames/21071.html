My current passion is reading and collecting roleplaying games from Japan. I did some work on the English translation of <i>Shinobigami</i>, and have cobbled together (unlicensed) translations of a few other games. My bread and butter of play is still mostly the American "classics" of the 80s and 90s thought: things like D&amp;D, Shadowrun, Traveller, and sometimes their more modern evolutions.<br/><br/>I'm super interested in games (roleplaying, board, card, war, video, parlor, and cetera) for the ways in which they model their "real world" referents, be those people, emotions, social interactions, stories, probabilities, material relationships, the structures of other mediums, or anything else that games try to make a part of themselves. I've probably inadvertently internalized a lot of post-structuralist thought and tend to analyze things from that angle even if I don't intend to do so overtly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462206/#Comment_462206" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T15:38:00+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  3:38PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2017 3:38PM by Kenny_J.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi I'm Kenny,<br/><br/>I currently live in the southwest [USA]. I loved finding this forum, though I don't always feel I have the right broad or extensive experience to add critical comment. I mostly approach things through the the lens of "my next big project." So if I sound like a broken record I apologize.<br/><br/>I am very passionate about the story games I've come across here but also a little daunted. So many here seem to make games and its a little scary to know there's tons of different nuanced ideas out there.  That being said its good company and I was surprised at how approachable everyone has been. Its kind of odd comparing that to how it felt looking in before.  <br/><br/>My favorite subject is sci-fi, but also any imaginative but grounded concepts. I also love world building but have had trouble marrying that to game design. Especially since I have moved toward pbta and never looked back. (I have been very frustrated last two times I tried to go back to D&amp;D or tried Numenera). However pbta has jump started my love for improvising world building on the fly and my friends and I have loved it.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462207/#Comment_462207" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T15:52:39+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  3:52PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Kenny.

I respond to all three. I'm a story gamer through and through, with a special passion for PbtA, Swords Without Master, and a few very narrowly-focused games. I'm in Tacoma, WA, so I'm fortunate to be in the middle of some of the largest hubs of Story Game Designers. I've designed a few games, most notably the fully realized Legend of the Elements (a PbtA AtLA game). Nowadays I like making tiny one-shot focused games with very very specific themes and purposes. I'm not really a frequent poster as I don't play enough oneshots to playtest for people, and I'm not really a theory kind of guy. Twitter is the place where I talk about most of my game stuff, if you can stomach my personal-life ramblings.<br/><br/>Outside of gaming I'm 23, in a dead-end job trying to get into grad school for biology, and generally just swinging between depression and contentedness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462215/#Comment_462215" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T17:14:12+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  5:14PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm James and I am a game designer (circle responds by saying "Hello James.")<br/><br/>I tinker a lot with PbtA: so far I've produced one full game and one mini one.

I'm lucky to be close enough to this fount of creative energy to get together and play every once in a while. I've only participated in a half dozen or so story game sessions, but it didn't take long till all my board game design wiseacreing migrated to story games.  I have a half dozen or so games brewing. None finished.<br/>I feel like every one of them brings something interesting and fun and maybe even clever. But I have no idea if any of them will actually work and facillitAte the creation of fun in play.   I am hoping to playtest one of the more compact ones next week.  It needs work still.

I used to write game reviews, but sort of grew out of it between kid-time pressures and the realization I'd rather play games than review them.<br/><br/>My palette of games isn't immense, but I do get bored playing the same game for more than 6 months or so. I used to run lots of convention games so I could get a chance to play some games I never get to play. I finally got multiple game groups together at home and now I'm not quite as eager to run convention and gameday games.<br/><br/>My current flavors are Pathfinder, Gumshoe, Traveller, and Mutants &amp; Masterminds, though I'll probably circle around to Fate again soon. <br/><br/>Supers is my current gaming obsession.

Any of those work. I started playing RPGs in junior high w/ dnd. Took a long break, and then got back into it in college. I haven't been able to shake the hobby since. <br/><br/>I'm in no functional way trained in the art of game design, but I've been struck with the bug for a while now (couple years at least). My two white whales that I'm currently working on are a Cyberpunk hack of FFG's Star Wars system and an original design Supers RPG tentatively titled Relentless. I've tried my hand at a couple micro-RPGs. Some of which I'm proud of, some I'm embarrassed of, and some I swear I'll revisit. But that's probably a lie.<br/><br/>Outside of RPGs I'm a reformed hipster who likes watching super bad movies, listening to as many different kinds of music as I can get my hands on, and basically avoiding being an adult as much as humanly possible.<br/><br/>Been lurking around here a couple years. Periodically I'll poke my head up to ask bizzare hypotheticals or leach off the wisdom of the boards. These days, I just can't run medieval fantasy based games anymore. As a genre I'm burned out on it. On the other hand, my SF roots and inveterate love of Cyberpunk keep me pretty firmly rooted in modern/near future settings and games. One thing I'd love to finish and have only kind of started is a fiasco playset where the players are the mooks of Gotham. Like the goons who are forced to buy matching clown outfits to be part of Joker's crew one week and then two-tone outfits to work for Two-Face the next.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462608/#Comment_462608" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T19:03:21+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  7:03PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I'm Jason.

I played AD&amp;D 2nd for most of my childhood (from when I was 12 on to when I was 25 or so). After moving to Dublin in 2008, I stumbled into a group of awesome players who introduced me to story games, and I've been playing ever since.<br/><br/>Even though my day-job is designing champions for the videogame League of Legends, I have yet to try my hands at designing a story game. I once wrote a short module for Hell for Leather, a brilliant gory sexy funny story game that my friend Sebastian Hickey designed.<br/><br/>I absolutely love reading about role-playing theory, even though I'm really bad at communicating what I learned to others. In 2010 or so I stumbled over the Forge and went on a multi-day reading binge. I still go back every now and then and deep-dive into conversations; most recently I've been trying to see what conversations Serpent's Tooth may have come out of (although it seems that might have been on this forum?)<br/><br/>I fully understand that a lot of people just don't care, and the job of a forum like this is mostly to make fun play happen by whatever means possible, but I still love the idea of deep diving into a theoretical construct that seeks to explain why fun around the table does or does not happen.<br/><br/>I now live in Los Angeles and I've finally started going to conventions again! Recently I've been to Gamestorm in Portland, where I took part in the Indie Hurricane run by local gaming group Games To Gather, and it was amazing. Next up I'm going to Seattle for Go Play Northwest in July. I have one group that I play with at work every week (currently about to start session 2 of a game of Microscope that had too many open questions to end after session 1), and I'm about to start playing Apocalypse World with another group at work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462898/#Comment_462898" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T07:06:20+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  7:06AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2017 6:02AM by AsIf.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey y'all --<br/><br/>I'm Tod Foley, also known as "As If" (my company is <a href="http://asifproductions.com/" rel="nofollow">As If Productions</a>).  I started designing RPGs and adventure modules in the 80s, when I wrote <i>Cyberspace</i>, and a couple handfuls of adventure modules for Iron Crown Enterprises.  I was also a co-author on <i>Space Master</i> (2nd edition).<br/><br/>In the 90s I took some of my RPG design theory into theater spaces, creating four interactive works including <i>Ghosts in the Machine</i> (CyberArts 1991), and then online, where I began building virtual worlds and interactive gizmos for The Palace (I built <i>The World of South Park</i> for Comedy Central - won an award for it too! - and <i>KoRn KoRner</i> for the band KoRn).  That's how I got into programming for the web, which I've been doing for a little over 20 years now.<br/><br/>This decade I got back into straight-up RPG design again, creating <i>DayTrippers </i>(a surreal science fiction reality-hopping RPG) and a line of modules for it, followed by <i>Other Borders</i> (a DramaSystem game of magic and intrigue in the modern American southwest), <i>Watch the World Die</i> (a collaborative apocalypse-creating game) and some other small ones.  You can find all this stuff on Drivethru at <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/6911/As-If-Productions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/6911/As-If-Productions</a><br/><br/>Currently I'm working on a near-future GM's sourcebook and a ten-author anthology of science fiction short stories (both) called <i>UbiquiCity</i>, and I could use some help bringing these books to market!

I follow things here pretty regularly, but have only posted a few times.<br/><br/>I cut my teeth on whatever edition of D&amp;D was on the shelves in 1978, played a ton of RPGs up through high school, and then played infrequently for roughly 25 years until 2011-2013, when I was flattened by the one-two-three punch of <i>Fiasco</i>, the <i>DCC RPG</i> and <i>Dungeon World</i>. I partly blame/bless Jason Morningstar for winding up that punch by leaving a copy of <i>Fiasco </i>for me at the Durham Country Library when I gave a talk there in 2011. Encountering those three games in what felt like rapid succession cemented RPGs as a permanent and important part of my life, and in the feverish aftermath I\u2019ve managed to produce a number of DW adventures and supplements as <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/7199/Lampblack--Brimstone?term=lampblack&amp;test_epoch=0" rel="nofollow">Lampblack &amp; Brimstone</a>.

In addition to a fun and rewarding job, the school has provided me with a steady flow of students who are at least RPG-curious, which means my weekly game group is never wanting for players. I also love introducing people to tabletop RPGs, so I host a group of 7-to-12-year-olds and occasional game nights at my school explicitly for neophytes.<br/><br/>I'm currently drawing the last two chapters of a comic book that I've been working on for the past 22 years of my life, and writing a standalone version of my <i>Dungeon World</i> hack <i>Freebooters on the Frontier</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462954/#Comment_462954" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T22:54:32+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 10:54PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I've been wondering since day one if you're the same Jason that wrote Berlin!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philipdutre" title="philipdutre"><img alt="philipdutre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philipdutre">philipdutre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463003/#Comment_463003" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T17:38:12+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  5:38PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2017 7:35PM by philipdutre.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mostly a lurker here ...<br/><br/>Gaming life: I have been involved for a long time in games and making my own games. As most of us, I've gone through different cycles of were my primary gaming itnerests are. Currently, it's mostly miniature gaming.<br/><br/>For the past couple of years, I have been mostly interested in combining miniature wargaming with story-driven and narrative techniques. We have experimented quite a lot with matrix-style arguments, combined with voting, to push a game forwards (see <a href="http://snv-ttm.blogspot.be/p/narrative-wargaming.html" rel="nofollow">http://snv-ttm.blogspot.be/p/narrative-wargaming.html</a>).<br/><br/>Another interest is mass-participation wargames: how to get &gt;100 people involved in a convention game? Last year, we ran such a game at a con, getting over 250 people to participate - each person adding a micro-decision to the overall game flow.

I live in north Italy.<br/><br/>I and my friends used to play traditional RPGs when we were younger and our afternoons longer.  Now our spare time is little and quite full of life and stuff (mine, mostly with music and HEMA), but lately - after years of hiatus - the passion was reignited, and sometimes we manage to juggle our schedules and have a nice RPG evening.<br/><br/>I'm more and more drawn away from trad RPGs towards GMless story games but have no real experience yet - and I'm not even sure whether I'll be able to steer my table there (we're playing Fate right now, and still struggling to break free from some of the Pathfinder ways).

I write solo games (that's games for one player to play by themselves) and tools to support that.<br/><br/>If there's a standard gaming career arc, I'm pretty sure I followed it; D&amp;D through the editions, a foray into WoD, a handful of different published systems here and there. One day I realized I just didn't have any interest in the "DM makes the content, players consume it" model my group favors, so I bowed out.<br/><br/>Since then I've been catching up on a decade or two of stuff I missed and it's been awesome! I love tinkering with all these new (to me!) ideas and it makes me really happy when other people enjoy what I've made.<br/><br/>...

a more abstract approach can actually lead to - or at least allow - a more realistic narration.<br/><br/>There also also a lot of misconceptions, some of which could be easily fixed, some not, for example:\n<ul>\n<li><i>"you need strength to use a longsword"</i>: it weighs about 1.5kg, strength is always useful in a fight (and grappling is always an option) but what you need most is training first, and then dexterity<br/></li><li><i>"you need dexterity to use a bow"</i>: here you actually need a lot of strength: a longbow could have a draw of 70kg!<br/></li><li><i>"dagger vs. longsword have equal chance to hit, but the longsword delivers more damage"</i>: a stab with a dagger would kill you just like a thrust with a sword, but hitting with a short weapon against a long one is much more difficult<br/></li><li><i>"arming swords are heavy and rapiers are light"</i>: they both weigh about 1kg or slightly more<br/></li><li><i>"armoured fighting is like unarmoured fighting, it's just more difficult to cut"</i>:<br/> mail and plate armours are impossible to cut; fighting in plate armour involves a lot of grappling, breaking joints, and stabbing through the gaps, or specialised weapons like maces, hammers and pollaxes<br/></li><li><i>"war hammers and axes are huge"</i>: actually they are quite small<br/></li><li>etc.<br/></li></ul>\nMaybe one day I'll write a blog post about this stuff.<br/><br/>[Edit: spelling, formatting]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465276/#Comment_465276" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-02T18:15:33+00:00" title="August  2, 2017  6:15PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2017 6:18PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noticed those things, too!

It sounds like - for example - a fight between two armoured knights would often end in a long grapple on the ground, until one knight got exhausted enough that the other could stick a dagger through an exposed spot (like the armpit).<br/><br/>If you're into talking about this stuff, a new thread might be quite interesting to people here!<br/><br/>Edit: In fact, I'll copy your post into an old thread I started.

Following those topics for any and all information and happily interacting with it. Like running the pre-alpha playtest a lot, attending various kind of LARPs and stuff.<br/> <br/>In regards of story games, I do like Powered by the Apocalypse. Specially Dungeon World. I am as well a fan of Tenra Bansho Zero, which basically brought me to this forum.<br/>I do play and like other games as well. Like Dungeons and Dragons 5E or various more OSR-y stuff.<br/> <br/>In general I guess am most well known for the crowdfunding collections. As I am ever since the V20 companion Kickstarter a fan of crowdfunding, wished for a comprehensive list of all tt projects, well and as there were none, I decided to be the change I like to see.<br/>Next to that I blog about stuff I find interesting. Like Actual Play, V5 news and stuff. ^^;<br/><br/>Safe from the role-playing games I am a normal database admin and do like to travel, as well as I usually try to learn new languages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465893/#Comment_465893" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-25T17:26:57+00:00" title="August 25, 2017  5:26PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi everybody!

My name is Travis Heldibridle a.k.a. "Hildy." Gaming has been the source of almost everything positive in my life. I lived in a bad neighborhood, but gaming kept me off the streets at night. I wanted to draw my characters, got good with a pencil and went to a vocational school for art. I got a computer to play MUD's and chat with other gamers on IRC, and found my aptitude for technology which lead to a career as a defense subcontractor (I also met my girlfriend of 19 years on IRC, so there's that).<br/><br/>I'm as passionate about the hobby, at 41, as I was when I was 16. More, actually, because the games have become so much more than what they used to be. Games like Fate, Apocalypse World, and Blades in the Dark dare you to get together with friends and conjure a world. I *love* that.<br/><br/>I've not really done anything notable in the industry, yet. I have aspirations of developing a hack/game but haven't hit on the idea I think is worth sharing yet.<br/><br/>When I'm not gaming or being political on social media, I mess around with InDesign, browse fonts, or cook.

I'm currently working on a game about travelling and hope to have something for people to alpha test in the next week or so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466181/#Comment_466181" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-10T03:45:51+00:00" title="September 10, 2017  3:45AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome, you two!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466350/#Comment_466350" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-19T17:04:00+00:00" title="September 19, 2017  5:04PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2017 5:04PM by moconnor.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I'm Michael.

I am Miguel.<br/><br/>I started playing roleplaying games about 2 years ago. A friend of mine had been wanting to try it for a while and for his birthday, his wife organized a D&amp;D gathering with all his friends that were interested. It was supposed to be a one-shot, but we all enjoyed it and continued playing on a monthly basis.<br/><br/>Anyway, eventually I had to relocate and ended up in Rockland county in NY, about 45min north of NYC, and over here, I found through Meetup a group that plays Story Games on a weekly basis. And after looking into it, it seemed very appealing as the games seemed to have more of the stuff I liked such as a creative outlet and a shared narrative experience and less of the combat and complicated rules that always seemed to interrupt the story. It was in June when I went to this Story Game meetup for the first time... and I have been hooked. I always look forward to it.<br/><br/>We play a different game each week, and it is always a different experience.

My real name is Billy but out of habit I use this chunky screen name.  I'm from Canada and right now I am a grad student.<br/><br/>I ended up here from Ben Robbins' blog a few months ago and was really impressed by all the interesting conversations that were going on.  So I stuck around and kept reading things.  Then I started posting a bit and so I realized I should introduce myself.<br/><br/>In terms of my RPG background, I started out with D&amp;D and still play it regularly (Pathfinder with a long-running group and 5e with a more recently formed group).  The last couple years I've been pretty interested in the OSR movement.  I'm especially drawn to the experimental, DIY attitude.  So lately I've been running and playing lots of little one-shots with whatever friends and family I can rope into playing with me, trying out different systems and concepts I've been thinking about.<br/><br/>I don't have that much experience with story games proper, of the kind where there is no GM and no scenario prepared.  If anything I am a little intimidated by them... the one time a friend and I tried playing one (it was <i>A Single Moment</i>), the game fizzled out after the first scene because we were struggling too much to come up with good ideas.  But I suspect that with some more practice, this kind of story game is exactly the sort of thing I would enjoy.  So that is also part of why I am hanging around this board, looking for more wisdom and insight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467984/#Comment_467984" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-24T19:21:22+00:00" title="November 24, 2017  7:21PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Billy, where are you in Canada?

A friend of mine used to play, so he took up the mantle of DM and we started playing with my brother and a couple of other friends.<br/><br/>Within a couple of sessions, I wanted to run my own game. I learned <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/fae/" rel="nofollow">FAE</a> (I wanted a simpler, more story-focussed game). Then I created my own world, and ran a story. It was a bit all over the place--new system, new story, new GM--but overall we had some fun.<br/><br/>From there I started designing my own RPG, "<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21382/prompt-an-rpg" rel="nofollow">Prompt</a>", using some ideas from FAE but putting a lot more emphasis on the characters and story.<br/><br/>And that brought me to the internets, and finally here.

Nice to meet you!<br/><br/>I am a real human being that is not an alien monster. But if I were an alien monster, then I would be nice and caring and lonely and in need of friendship. But I'm not.<br/><br/>I'm new to story games as a concept. I'm new to the tabletop community (I've only started playing over the past year), but I noticed a lack of interesting experiences at the D&amp;D table. I'm not entirely sure if it's just me, if people view RPGs differently, or what, but I think putting the focus on narrative might help me enjoy RPGs. I think. I have no idea what I'm doing, so here's my current views on roleplaying, because I'm flustered and don't know what to type:<br/><br/>I'm not a die-hard "roleplaying is for the message!" kind of beast, but I'm conscious of the messages in media. I don't think games can "opt out" of having a narrative; people read into things, whether you want them to or not. I don't think recognizing narrative will make games less fun; if anything, it makes games <i>more</i> fun. When you can, beyond any doubt, know that the villain needs to be stopped, that the plot isn't a huge contrivance, that the fiction world full of entirely fictional people has real value, then it makes the experience valuable. You can leave the table and be better prepared for the years ahead, not by avoiding the stressers in your life, but by confronting and overcoming them. And no, I don't believe in catharsis, in the sense that "venting" by beating up monsters <b>1)</b> won't remove the source of stress, and <b>2)</b> will cause that stress to pile back even harder. And I don't know about you, but I don't approve of innocent monsters getting slaughtered. That's just mean.<br/><br/>On the flip side, roleplaying can make otherwise indigestible lessons more tolerable. You can experience personal struggles that hit close to home as an elven ranger from the untamed wilds, explore grand philosophical questions while light years away from home, find disturbing parallels to reality in an ancient fantasy empire. You can even talk RPG design while pretending to be a passive-aggressive alien. Not that anyone does that. I mean, they'd have to be a real weirdo.<br/><br/>What else...I'm working on a universal RPG. Nothing earth-shattering; I realize the games market is saturated, so I'm designing for the fun. I think there's some universal themes that can be best demonstrated with universal mechanics. Stuff like combat being inherently unfair, character growth not always being positive. Again, nothing earth-shattering, but I'm fine with that. And there's something fun in designing mechanics for every possible use case. What if the player characters are insects? Kaiju? Middle aged? What if they're middle aged insect kaiju? These are incredibly important questions we should be asking our players.<br/><br/>Wow, this post got out of hand. I think that about covers it.

I always knew about these kinds of games, but i could never really play them because you need a bit of bravery to ask some people you know to sit down and play this wierd thing that you like, and i never had that as a kid. <br/><br/>I have recently mananged to ask some people to play games with me, and they seemed to have a good time. Everyone was really creative and wonderful, and we did a small dnd campaign together. <br/><br/>Next I am planning to build a mod of Apocolypse World with my gaming group. I am looking at 'Simple World' and i just want to have fun and be spontanious- see what happens. The first worldbuilding and character stuff, and probably a bit of play will happen in a month and i am really excited, just trying to prep without prepping.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469412/#Comment_469412" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-29T05:35:55+00:00" title="January 29, 2018  5:35AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On nonviolent RPGs:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20884/non-violent-story-games-and-rpgs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20884/non-violent-story-games-and-rpgs</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469458/#Comment_469458" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-30T15:30:01+00:00" title="January 30, 2018  3:30PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/dannyrklg1" rel="nofollow">dannyrklg1</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I am a guy, my name is danny, I live in the uk. please excuse my spelling. </p></div></blockquote>\nHi, danny!<br/><br/>Don't go putting extra U's in "color" and shit.

My name is Peter and I've been reading this forum for a while but have up until recently <br/>been feeling a  bit  too "uneducated" to engage in the discussions.<br/><br/>I'm an indie game developer as of last Christmas when I released a Swedish trad game with indie influences called <a href="http://fornsaga.se" rel="nofollow">Fornsaga</a> (that was kickstarted last April).<br/><br/>Right now I'm very curious about the indie and story game scene and want to explore all there is to experience out there.<br/><br/>I'm also working on a GM-less game in English, currently in alpha that goes under the name Anno Daemonum. I'm play testing it on Swedish conventions this year. It's sort of a mix between hillfolk, don't rest your head, trollbabe, nemesis and apocalypse world (in that order). However there is a new strive towards making it more influenced by archipelago and Dominion (as in the deck building board/card game).<br/><br/>Yeah so I hope to have some great discussions on this forum of yours.

I\u2019ve recently gotten into indie tabletop RPGs &amp; story games, so a friend recommended I make an account on here. I\u2019m hoping to find some new games &amp; systems, learn about game design, and get feedback on some initial attempts at designing tabletop games.<br/><br/>A bit about my gaming background: I played a bit of D&amp;D 3.5 &amp; 4 at the beginning of college, then didn\u2019t play for about a decade. I started getting back in after listening to The Adventure Zone podcast, and then actually started playing D&amp;D when some boardgaming friends expressed interest in trying 5e.<br/><br/>From there I started getting into my local gaming store scene a bit, and listening to a whole bunch of tabletop podcasts (some favorites: Adventure Zone, One Shot, Campaign, Join the Party, &amp; NeoScum). While I\u2019ve learned about a lot of other RPGs (mostly from One Shot), my actual play experience is limited to Fantasy Flight Star Wars, Call of Cthulhu, Lasers &amp; Feelings, Everyone Is John, Dungeon World, World Wide Wrestling, and Strange New Worlds. Right now I\u2019m on a bit of a PbtA kick.<br/><br/>I recently took my first crack at game design with a cyberpunk-themed hack of Lasers &amp; Feelings, available <a href="http://cyberpunk-rpg.com" rel="nofollow">here</a> (I\u2019ll post more about this, as I\u2019m looking for feedback/critique).<br/><br/>If you want to check out my other work, most of what I do is available <a href="http://davidbrunellbrutman.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Looking forward to chatting with you fine folks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tim_aych" title="tim_aych"><img alt="tim_aych" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tim_aych">tim_aych</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470359/#Comment_470359" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-03T08:54:34+00:00" title="March  3, 2018  8:54AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all, glad to be heard. <br/><br/>I'm a writer who used to play C of C and cyberpunk back in the 90s.

My system of choice is GURPS* for which I created my Saduria gameworld (not completed but available online - Google GURPS Saduria if you're interested). I'm currently looking to convert Call of Cthulhu to run under GURPS because I love the setting but I'm not completely happy with the Chaosium/BRP or d20 system mechanics. I played Trail of Cthulhu but the GM was too mechanics-led and confrontational for the game to work. I'd be happy to give it another shot with a more storytelling-focussed GM.<br/><br/>In terms of the Robin Laws play style list, I would place myself firmly in the 'Storyteller' style of player, with perhaps the slightest trace of 'Method Actor'. I certainly enjoy fleshing out background as much as actually rolling dice, but don't do voices or full-on immersion. <br/><br/>Games that interest me but I haven't played include 13thAge and Monsterhearts. As a straight white English male with (slightly) greying hair, exploring the world of queer teenage monster angst at a US high school would certainly push my roleplaying. Given that most of my characters tend to be female anyway, I might even learn something!<br/><br/><br/><br/>*For those who are wary of GURPS, don't be. Despite being labelled a 'complicated' system it really isn't, with character creation and gameplay being 3d6-based and (IMHO) far more streamlined than, for example, Pathfinder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470565/#Comment_470565" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-12T13:21:44+00:00" title="March 12, 2018  1:21PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to Story-Games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470784/#Comment_470784" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-18T20:22:45+00:00" title="March 18, 2018  8:22PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2018 10:49PM by Tanya Fyans.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tanya here. <br/><br/>As most other people are jumping off this cliff, the first printed table top RPG I played was Advanced Fighting Fantasy back when I was nine years old (I'm now in my mid/late thirties to date things). Nowadays my fave games (off the top of my head) include FreeMarket, Houses of the Blooded, Dog Eat Dog, 3:16, and Fiasco.<br/><br/>I'm coming back to the Story Games forum after a very busy (and life changing on many fronts) time away. I've missed out on lots of the more recent shiny things that have happened with games of late and so want to pick up on all the new developments. That said I kept a wee eye on releases and tried out the odd demo here and there. Things are settling down for me and so gaming is back on the cards, which led me to reactivate my account. I'm also likely to run some LARP stuff in the near future around Edinburgh/Scotland/Britain. <br/><br/>Looking forward to the good chat.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470785/#Comment_470785" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-18T20:49:31+00:00" title="March 18, 2018  8:49PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome back.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff" title="mabgriff"><img alt="mabgriff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff">mabgriff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472950/#Comment_472950" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T04:19:44+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  4:19AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi everyone, I'm Mab.<br/><br/>I've always been interested in tabletop gaming, but most of the opportunities I had early on were DnD groups that never got past the second session. More recently I got back into the hobby due to shows like RollPlay, The Adventure Zone, and Friends at the Table. Unfortunately I don't have a local group (Long Island) to try more games with.<br/><br/>The PbtA games were my introduction to the idea of story games, and now I'm kind of obsessed with them. I'm a writer, but my background is in mathematics, so the idea of exploring what makes stories work through different mathematical rule systems is totally fascinating to me. I actually use a lot of GM prep tools in my fiction outlining process now.<br/><br/>I've run Numenera, Fate Accelerated, and a very brief game of Microscope, and right now I'm running the Mistborn Adventure Game long-distance for some friends once a month. I'm also almost done with version 0 of my own system, inspired by what I considered strengths and weaknesses of the GM experience in those games.<br/><br/>I'll probably go back to lurking for a bit after this introduction. It's my nature. But I'm really glad I stumbled across this community.

But I find ways to pass time in somewhat gaming related activities anyway.<br/><br/>I host a small podcast called <b>Nordnordost</b>.  It used to have a heavy story gaming focus, but it has shifted focus with my interests and now we cover trad and OSR as well.<br/><br/>I edit a small RPG fanzine called <b>HYDRA</b>, which embraces games and ideas from the period 1968-1989, and games that copy the feeling and style of that era.<br/><br/>I design games under the label <b>Wilhelm's Games</b>. Games which, for the most part, nobody plays. Though I'm proud of them, I don't care for the marketing and business side of publishing. Designing games is a hobby in itself.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473148/#Comment_473148" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T20:14:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  8:14PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of saying that nobody plays them, can you say why they are excellent and put a link to some of them ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473155/#Comment_473155" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T20:55:39+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  8:55PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He is kidding.

About a year ago, I made an effort to expand my horizons, by hanging out on forums and talking to other players and creators. So this is a continuation of that project.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm mostly interested in neotraditional games. I've had a few ventures into more collaborative storytelling games, which have been fun, but so far they've mostly been temporary changes of pace.<br/><br/>Not a big fan of crunch, arbitrary systems or OSR, though I try to keep an open mind.<br/><br/>I've tinkered with a bunch of homebrews and hacks throughout the years, but I haven't published anything yet. I also run a conversational roleplaying podcast called <a href="http://fummelpodden.se" rel="nofollow">Fummelpodden</a> (it's in Swedish).<br/><br/>Sometimes, I enjoy discussion just for the sake of discussion. And sometimes I say subjective things in a categorical way. I'm working on it, so please tell me if I go out of line.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SMSNovel" title="SMSNovel"><img alt="SMSNovel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SMSNovel">SMSNovel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473906/#Comment_473906" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T14:06:48+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  2:06PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello.

I'm a fairly new designer who had the luck of coming across lumpley's <i>Apocalypse World</i> during high school, which really helped kickstart my passion for game design. <br/><br/>I play a lot of PbTA, but my first experiences role-playing were in IRC chats back when I was an immature, prepubescent fart - and, subsequently, trashy high school AD&amp;D 1e . Now I'm 19, and have devoured a lot of material through skimming and bumping into the Story Games community every now &amp; again.<br/><br/>I tend to design games that are either fairly derivative of the media that I consume; or, once in a blue moon, I come up with some absolutely off-the-wall stuff. That being said, I'm jazzed to be apart of such a stunning community of fellow designers, and I hope to learn lots from you guys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476224/#Comment_476224" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-20T15:27:27+00:00" title="August 20, 2018  3:27PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome Machi and Comeau!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476387/#Comment_476387" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T18:12:02+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  6:12PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2018 6:12PM by Double King.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here.

Time to fix that, perhaps?<br/><br/>I'm known as Rafu, which is short for my given name, Raffaele. I'm a human being* from Italy, usually registering as male, sometimes as a princess (though with a beard). <small>Alright, there might be a little bit of vampire to me, or whichever other nocturnal species can interbreed with humans. But mostly human.</small><br/>I'm 39. I live in a small town near Florence, in a pretty small apartment, with my chosen human partner - who's into role-playing games too - and our three lovely cats (also ghosts - the literal ghosts of the dead - but we all have those, don't we?). We play a lot of role-playing games! Perhaps we even play too much. I've been playing those since I was 10, but the quality <i>and</i> quantity of play I get have both improved over the years. We also enjoy having friends over for dinner parties and the like, which we do as often as possible, but not as regularly as we play games.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, I also design games (well, we both do). I've been doing so since I was 11, I reckon, but I'm afraid I haven't managed to get much of my work [self-]published yet, much less design anything people might have heard of.<br/><br/>Role-playing games apart, I hold a degree in, uh, not particularly useful stuff that I love (old stuff, Japanese stuff). I used to be able to speak Japanese and I considered moving to Japan, but that was loooong ago and nowadays I wouldn't. I think I'm pretty good at English - that's because I learnt from games. I've been a translator (of manga, anime, some role-playing games too) and a teacher (of English as a second language, to grownups). These days I'm trying to get back to freelancing full-time: I guess that's where my heart is?<br/>I also have a bit of a peculiar fashion sense. I call myself a <i>tiepunk</i>, if that means anything to you.<br/><br/>I don't yet have a nice website up for you all at <a href="http://www.platonicduck.eu/" rel="nofollow">platonicduck.eu</a> - but I do have <a href="https://tinyletter.com/rafu" rel="nofollow">an e-mail newsletter at tinyletter.com/rafu</a> that I use (in lieu of a "social" website) to broadcast what I'm doing (RPG-wise) to my friends all over the world. I also have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rafu" rel="nofollow">this Patreon page</a> that I was very conflicted about relaunching, but that's going to become the primary outlet for my design work (quite a lot of games I've designed and played, but not yet written down). Check those out if you feel like it.<br/><br/>I've kept coming back to this forum over the years. I like being here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476627/#Comment_476627" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-09T11:35:51+00:00" title="September  9, 2018 11:35AM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, didn't you design Awkward ?

My most well-known games stuff is probably Geiger Counter (which has never been formally released), Metrofinal (ditto), and the Planarch Codex stuff for Dungeon World, though recently I've been working on a number of freeform larps and experimental games. People in indie games circles often call me "Jaywalt" /" JWalt," which was a college nickname. Most of my game stuff is published under "J. Walton," because I used to have a serious think-tank job and didn't want those worlds to get mixed up.

Maybe even played it -- who can recall?<br/><br/>Hi! I'm Hans. It\u2019s very strange, but comforting, to be back here. I remember the day I joined in, I believe, January 2009. I felt like I wasn't cool enough and didn't have enough experience to be here, but I came anyway, and posted and read almost daily for years. <br/><br/>I haven\u2019t been involved in internet discussions about roleplaying in some time, probably since 2013 or so. I have been playing since then, but not a great deal, and not with the voracity I had to keep up with the new new new new new from about 2007-2013.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve run a fair amount of fifth edition, both some of the published adventures as well as a short campaign I designed on my own. I enjoyed running the published adventures more (I don\u2019t have the time or emotional energy to create a campaign!), but I found making 5e fun is just as dependent on having the right group with the same type of buy-in as making, say, Sorcerer fun is. Anyway, I don\u2019t see dipping my toes back in any time soon.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve played good games with <a href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX">@EnricPDX</a> not that long ago!<br/><br/>For the last two years I\u2019ve run a monthly game at my office, for some of our customers, who are all adults with developmental disabilities. We started out using 5e, moved to the Black Hack, moved to Lamentations, and have settled on Dungeon Crawl Classics. That last is ideal for fantasy roleplaying that keeps the rules-handling as much out of the players\u2019 hands as possible \u2013 some of my folks aren\u2019t skilled readers, so looking up and knowing spells doesn\u2019t work for them. With DCC, I just have them roll and I look up the result on a chart. It keeps high-complexity classes firmly in the grasp of anyone.<br/><br/>I was heavily involved in local public gaming community from about 2010-2013, and left that abruptly. I haven't been to a convention since I think late 2012.<br/><br/>I got divorced.<br/><br/>I go in and out of interest with Warhammer; I like to paint minis but committing to the game is a lot! I was very into Netrunner for a while.<br/><br/>I <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/138759/Kim-and-Marshall" rel="nofollow">quietly self-published</a> one game that I\u2019ve always viewed as sort of perverse, and now even more so. I\u2019m not ashamed of it, but it\u2019s of little interest to anyone, and I\u2019m neither surprised nor saddened to find that\u2019s the case. Working on it and playtesting it and finishing it was more for me than for anyone else.<br/><br/>I\u2019m far less interested in game design these days than in writing. I\u2019ve been writing fiction mostly daily since March 2015. I think my strengths lie in words rather than experience design, and part of my interest in game publishing was surely due to wanting to be one of the \u201ccool\u201d people in the scene a decade or less ago. I have no interest in that any more, but I do want to write well and write deeply and connect with an audience, and I\u2019m continually working on that. <br/><br/>My girlfriend and I want to move to Detroit, and depending on how things with her job work out that may happen in the next year (or we may move to Beijing or somewhere in Germany; who knows?). We both are keen to make a new start somewhere other than the west coast.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not currently playing or running any rpgs other than the work game.

Generally involved in or running a session every month, I would love to do more, but real life comittments always get in the way (wife, children, work, etc etc)<br/><br/>Currently running BRP (RuneQuest Glorantha and Call of Cthulhu), Fate Core, and Sharp Swords &amp; Sinister Spells. Lots of other systems up my sleeve, but these are my current addictions. Sometimes I turn up as a player for a mate's D&amp;D 5E game, which is fun, but not my thing to GM. <br/><br/>I've always keeping a lookout for new systems, my most recent purchases are Blood &amp; Bronze, Forbidden Lands, Blades In The Dark, and City Of Mist. Not sure when I'll get around to playing them, but they look good. Backing the Cortex Prime kickstarter at present, so that should be good once published.<br/><br/>The main game I am running at the moment is set in Middle Earth, I am using various supplements from The One Ring rpg, however I wasn't sold on the mechanics, so I'm using Fate Core to run it instead, and things are going great. <br/><br/>Happy New Year everyone, here's to many gaming memories to come!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479432/#Comment_479432" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-03T11:36:47+00:00" title="January  3, 2019 11:36AM">January 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome Mankcam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21071%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21071%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Welcome!

I think I may be some kind of Internet ghost.

I started off with D&amp;D, then moved on to GURPS, Fudge, and finally jumped on this crazy story game bandwagon. I've written lots of source material for Fudge (back when there was even an online magazine for it called Fudge Factor). I also wrote my own story game called Muse (co-designed with Paul T).<br/><br/>I also started a regular lunch-time Muse game with co-workers! My boss walked in on us once and thought we were playing Poker. Too funny.<br/><br/>I'm playing games regularly with Paul, Jeff and Dave (regulars on this forum, unlike me). We're just trying out various story games, going through them one at a time. Our latest was Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne, and before that it was Tales of Entropy. We'll have gone through all of them sometime around 2080.<br/><br/>Ciao,<br/><br/>--Jonathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479657/#Comment_479657" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-13T04:55:42+00:00" title="January 13, 2019  4:55AM">January 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" rel="nofollow">Demiurge</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> We'll have gone through all of them sometime around 2080.</p></div></blockquote>\nOoh!

The last one and a half years though my interest in story games or role playing games has really exploded. I started reading about the history of D&amp;D, which led me to the OSR, which in turn led me to indie rpgs (by which I mean anything but D&amp;D). I think it was when I eventually read Dogs in the Vineyard that I realized there was a lot more out there than I had thought.<br/><br/>Since then I spend a lot of time reading game books and these forums, and luckily I get to run a game almost every week too. I really want to get better at running games, even more than that though I'd really like to understand what I'm doing when I run them, but that feels constantly out of reach. I don't write often, but I'm trying to change that which is part of why I made an account here.<br/><br/>I play whatever I can get people to play. I've mostly played 5th edition D&amp;D with Trollbabe or Dungeon Crawl Classics coming in second. Other games that I've played and enjoyed include:<br/>Monster of the Week (Pbta), Mothership, Ten Candles, and Fiasco (I've also run Cthulhu Dark but didn't really care for it in practice)<br/><br/>Some games that I've read and am very eager to play: Mouseguard, Apocalypse World, Blades in the Dark<br/><br/>Some games that I'm excited about but haven't even read yet: Pendragon (currently reading), The Mountain Witch, Polaris: Chivalric Tragedy at the Utmost North, Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479728/#Comment_479728" name="Item_212" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-15T03:43:20+00:00" title="January 15, 2019  3:43AM">January 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really cool cross-section of the game hobby!

The Black Hack has been my go to for running local MeetUp one-shots for its simplicity but very much looking forward to The Forest Hymn &amp; Picnic being finished and always willing to explore something new.<br/><br/>Entered the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23200WordRPG&amp;Mode=like">#200WordRPG</a> challenge last year (Zap! Atomic Ray Gun!) and started making a sci-fi heartbreaker last December; it's since turned into a board game with RPG elements and nearing(possibly) beta testing... keen to share when ready but obviously only if the board is amenable to that kind of thing.<br/><br/>I'm not great at keeping up with posting on forums - partly due to reasonably standard social anxiety, partly time related - but sometimes it works out alright. <br/><br/>So... yes.

I\u2019ve been playing RPGs since the early 90\u2019s - pretty familiar with a wide arrange of trad RPGs from that era up to today. In the last five(?) years or so I\u2019ve become really intrigued by the indie/storygame/narrativist/improv/whatever-you-want-to-call-it side of the hobby.<br/><br/>I recently began designing my own games (well, I\u2019ve always designed stuff - I\u2019m just sharing it now) and trying to be a more active member of the community (I\u2019ve always lurked around forums, but never contributed much - I\u2019m trying to change that).<br/><br/>So far, I\u2019ve got a fantasy pbta hack I created -<br/><br/><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/271947/Tales-of-the-Obsidian-Idol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/271947/Tales-of-the-Obsidian-Idol</a><br/><br/>And a weird, absurdist, boardgame-meets-rpg thing that I made over a weekend -<br/><br/><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273717/Barbarians-of-Academia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273717/Barbarians-of-Academia</a><br/><br/>This summer I\u2019m planning on revising the first and creating some expansions for the second, as well as maybe trying my hand at some OSR stuff, as that\u2019s another area of the hobby that I\u2019m intrigued by, but never really had a lot of experience with (I cut my teeth on very railroaded 2E AD&amp;D, and got the majority of my early training from White Wolf storyteller advice and adventure design...it\u2019s taken a while to unlearn what I now consider some really bad habits)<br/><br/>So that\u2019s my story in a nutshell. I\u2019ve really enjoyed this forum that only discovered a couple of years ago, and the recent threads about whether or not this forum is hostile to newcomers made me realize I should probably create an account and join in. (On that note, I have sometimes found the discussions here a little intimidating, as I just don\u2019t have range of background knowledge and indie rpg experience that a lot of the posters do. But that\u2019s just my own anxiety. Otherwise, the forum has always seemed welcoming.)<br/><br/>Nice to meet you all!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483821/#Comment_483821" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T19:57:39+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  7:57PM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome.
