In order to hit you, your attacker just has to assign a higher die to attacking you than you've assigned to defending yourself.<br/><br/>So that's one way.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438416/#Comment_438416" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T06:13:30+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  6:13AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see two basic ways to have opposition work with Otherkind-ish dice.  One is passive opposition and one is active opposition.  <br/><br/>In the first case, you just have each round of conflict be focused on one character.  When it is my turn, I declare my goal, we decide on a danger or two, and I roll that number of dice and distribute them.  Enemy opposition sits back passively and watches while I make the decisions.  So Player Z's saying "I fight back" just adds a danger to the roll of "Z causes you bodily harm" or the like.  (Possibly, the defender's skill could also change the target numbers for the attacker or otherwise influence the roll.)  The GM might roll dice for NPCs, or they might never have a turn for the NPCs and simply insert NPC attacks as dangers into PC actions.<br/><br/>Or you could have active opposition, more like Vincent describes Mobile Frame Zero.  When two parties are opposed, we each declare goals and decide on any secondary dangers or issues that need to be resolved.  Then each opposed party rolls their pool of dice and takes turns distributing them to different goals and dangers.  Whoever puts their highest die toward a goal decides how that issue turns out.<br/><br/>I could see either one of those basic systems working out just fine in the right game.  Either method could be customized to fit the game as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438419/#Comment_438419" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T06:29:54+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  6:29AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys!

"Images of you are captured the whole time by the covert security system" and "your ward isn't sneaky enough to accompany you".  Or "You're shot by the guard atop the back tower" and "Betty's force field deflects or absorbs most of the rock's energy".

Basically it works out as a simultaneous confrontation, where one die determines what you do to your opponent, while the other die determines how well you handle your own situation. <br/><br/>Both high - You get a hit in, and you prevent them dealing extra damage.<br/>One High - Either you get your hit in, but allow them to do get in a bit more damage too...or you miss the hit, but block any extra damage from theirs.<br/>Both Low - You miss, and they get in a bit more damage than they would otherwise.<br/><br/>If you apply a low die to your defence, and they don't hit, then extra damage doesn't make sense... instead something narrative and strategic occurs and your opponent gains an advantage to their next strike.<br/><br/>That's the basic theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
