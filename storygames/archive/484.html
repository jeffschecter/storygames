                    I'm looking for advice on alpha testing Grey Ranks, which is probably 80% ready for it.<br/><br/>Here's the deal - you play Grey Ranks over four sessions or so, and each builds on the previous one in major ways.  The setting and the player characters change pretty dramatically from session one to session four.  I'm estimating a complete game takes about sixteen hours of play.  <br/><br/>Now, playtesting is all about finding the problems, and kicking the design until it breaks.  What I'd really like to do is invite playtesters to hammer at it for a couple of hours and then discuss - this seems to be a good model.  I can't impose sixteen hours of semi-functional play on anybody.  <br/><br/>So help me out - what's the most effective way to handle my situation?  One thing I considered was creating a stable of PCs at various states of degeneration (session one, session three, etc) so that I could ask folks to pick them up "mid-game" easily.  Another would be to have strict system-only tests (I've actually done a bit of that).  I'm looking for ideas.<br/><br/>And once the major bugs have been addressed, I'll start running it for real, but at least I'll be able to promise my beta testers a functional experience.  Thoughts?  Experiences?                </div>

I'm not sure it's that easy. Alot of good designers struggle with this. Whenever you have a game that builds on itself like that, I think the only way to properly playtest is to play the whole damn thing. I really, really wish there's another way, but I don't think there is one. The issue is that with each passing phase, the game branches out. While you may only have a couple of possible ways for the first phase to play out, you have tons and tons with the last.<br/><br/>You can look at both <i>My Life with Master</i> and, admittedly, my own <i>The Mountain Witch</i> as examples of games that had trouble with this. In both of these books, the beginning of the game is described with a lot of confidence and advice, but the end not so much. Also, having witnessed Ron Edwards try and playtest both <i>Doctor Chaos</i> and the very-soon-to-be-released <i>It was a Mutual Decision</i>, I can say that he also had trouble, at least in the early phases of playtesting. Both games worked really well in the beginning, but as the game progressed, because both games built upon themselves, issues started popping up. Ron got lucky, however, in that both games are playable in a single session, so he was able to get alot of playtesting in.<br/><br/>When I was playtesting tMW, I was only able to get a few complete games in, but a ton of half-games. (Now I'm trying to flesh out the advice with the "clarifications" page on my website.)                        </div>

                            Jason... <em>good luck</em>, dude.<br/><br/>Playtesting is tough, and playtesting long-form stuff is even tougher.  At some point, you need to play the whole game, which it looks like you're planning on doing later, which is good.  In the immediate and semi-immediate, setting up pre-genned situations and scenarios that you hope and predict will come about in play, and playing those out to make sure that those mechanics work, is about as good as you can do.  Basically, hash out the pieces first, and then worry about stringing the pieces together.  If nothing else, the stringing-together will be functional-but-disjointed, which is loads better for your brave playtesters than totally nonfunctional play.                        </div>

                            Ah well...<br/><br/>Luckily I reside in a hotbed of playtest-friendly goobers.  I shall make them cry their eyes out!  Grey Ranks constrains situation to a crazy degree so that will also help - "This is session three, so it must be September 2, 1944" crazy.                        </div>

<p>You certainly do.  I'd also like to point out that you may have much less trouble finding long-term playtesters amongst us than you're imagining.  After all, most, if not all, of us have our own long-term games in mind.  Games that'll require playtesting of their own.</p>
<p>See where I'm going with this?</p>
