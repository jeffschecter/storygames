Someone has finally said something that has been lurking in the back of my mind for a long, long time.<br/>
<br/>
A game design doesn't have to be focused to be good.                </div>

That being said, for an indie designer, making a good unfocused design might very well be too much work for one person to do.                        </div>

I wonder if, instead of 'unfocused' calling such designs 'negative-focus' would be more accurate?  Focus is, by nature, a selective process, and can be done positively (this thing) or negatively (not this, that, or the other).                        </div>

<i>...Focus is, by nature, a selective process...</i><br/><br/>Yeah, but most of this lack of focus is non-reflective.  That is, it's unfocused because "all the other big-selling games have strength and dex ratings, combat rounds and weapon speeds, so we need to have that too". <br/><br/>I do overall agree with the essay overall, though. I'm kind of more oriented towards focused games, but I don't snobbily deny folks that go for unfocused games. But I still prefer unfocused games that still do something new and cool. Like FATE, or HeroQuest, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Admittedly, there are crap games out there that ape prior successes rather than strive to create something original.  But then, there are crap "focused" games, too, that try and mimic, I dunno, Sorcerer, without actively selecting what it is they're trying to accomplish.                        </div>

The game is gorgeous on all levels.. but ALL the rules involve combat or rolling dice, nothing "roleplay-ish". But again, I'll bring it up in another thread in a bit.<br/>

<p>Isn't this sort of like what Vincent mention a while ago, about that fruitful "space" in the game flow that's not covered by mechanics? Like morality / faith in Dogs. The mechanics don't get in the way of judging the moral standing of your character - there's a lack of "saving throw vs apostasy" rolls and such - but there's DWM driving in lots of other pieces. So perhaps that's part of a sweet spot between the two?</p>

                            Dev, <br/><br/>No, they may be related -- but they aren't the same thing. Dogs is most definatly a "design what matters" game. That fruitful void is designed around, the game creates that void by playing by the rules in the text. <br/><br/>"Design what doesn't matters" games may also have that void (or they might have a very filled up space that they want to rotate around), but the void comes from the skills, personalities, and social-level procedures of those around the table with very little (if anything) of it coming from the rules in the text. <br/><br/>Dogs is designed to bring you to the void so you can fill it. Something like A Game of Thrones is designed for those who already are at the void (or the monolith), and want something that they can use to keep them there without having to change the important parts about how they play.                        </div>

                            So... why would anyone ever bother to write a system that, by its own design, doesn't matter?<br/>
<br/>
Write a setting book.<br/>
<br/>
GURPS, which I know pretty well, has this thing, where people own the book, but what they're playing isn't GURPS. They're using completely other systems to do stuff. Systems that are completely in the social contract area.<br/>
<br/>
Fred, you're talking about declining to design a system. It's easy to not design a system. So what you're doing is saying, "Here's a system that won't get used. Everything else, work out for yourselves. Here's some scenery to put in your social contract.<br/>
<br/>
When this is functioning, I think Dev's probably right: it's a fruitful void wherein interesting stuff happens because of the interactions of the people with the rules, but not as a direct result of enacting the rules. When this is not functioning, you're wasting money publishing pages no one's going to use, probably because you want your book to be thicker.<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something? How can designing rules that aren't used in the game help the game?                        </div>

                            Other Joshua -- <br/><br/>The rules <em>do</em> get used.  The rules are used to marginalize content rather than emphasize content.  They are rules to the effect of, "Okay, either you do sneak past the guard to get inside where the interesting stuff is, or you don't sneak past the guard and have to find a different way in.  Roll real quick so we can get to the interesting stuff inside."  It is a fundamentally different use for rules than pervy Forge mechanics assume.<br/><br/>You're right; there <em>is</em> a Loopy Poopy system for the important stuff; it's not from the published material, and it was not a consideration in the design of that material.  The published material takes care of the unimportant stuff so you can use your social system and/or homebrew house rules of preference for the stuff you do care about.  It is (when designed well) a time saver.                        </div>

Well, I'm still not really following this one.  I can see this for the case of a "toolkit" approach like Fudge.  I think, though, that other broad games like Primetime Adventures, Universalis, and The Pool fall in with this.  <br/><br/>In contrast, there are games which give direction.  I mean, if I pick up Toon and if I pick up Pendragon, I'll get different games.  The same applies to My Life With Master and Dogs in the Vineyard.  These games will have different centers, in contrast to DWDM which apparently simply helps you to get at whatever center that you had already decided on.                        </div>

                            We're debating PTA over on my blog, and I'm sorely ill-equipped having never read the thing.  The Pool and Universalis are, however, Design What Doesn't Matter, yes.  My Life with Master and Dogs are Design What Matters, yes.<br/>
<br/>
The PTA question boils down to whether the mechanics actually guide the players to express and manipulate their issues in a certain way, or just flags them so the playgroup knows what they want, and they will play about and around that in whatever direction they like.  Having not read it yet, I'm not sure whether PTA does this or not.                        </div>

                            Are you asking for classifications of those games?  I'm not sure the distinction is as valid when you go back that far.<br/>
<br/>
I think Toon was DWM before people really understood it, and I'm not sure it's as effective as a more modern design would be, but you have to admit that the "boggle" rule (if what someone else's character does makes you laugh out loud, your character is boggled) is definitely a DWM type of rule.<br/>
<br/>
TnT and DnD are probably mostly DWM games too, if you see "what matters" as killing monsters and taking their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Pendragon is probably DWM for its focus on dynasties and virtues.                        </div>

                            I'll agree with Vax that Toon is probably an early Design What Matters design, with perhaps less-efficient implimentation.<br/>
<br/>
I'd think Pendragon is at best grasping for Design What Matters, in that it does have some real sense of what kind of game it wants you to play, but I don't know if the system really gets you there.  Much like Brand's depiction of the Storyteller games, which sell you on the idea in the setting text and GM advice, but don't offer systemic support and guidance to acheive it -- if you can hit the target on your own, you're good, but if you can't, the game is not going to help you.<br/>
<br/>
TnT I seriously have no idea on.  For a long time I thought the title was a funny joke; it's only recently that I found out it's a real game and not just a play on D&amp;D.                        </div>

                            I'm not certain that DWM/DWDM is a good duology.  Ok, I'll go stronger and say I think it's a false duology.<br/>
<br/>
Designing with negative space is very important -- and I agree that it's something that's underused in a lot of the more concious Indy games.<br/>
<br/>
But DWDM?  Nobody can even agree on what the DWDM games -are-.  DnD believes that combat matters, so there are a lot of rules for combat.  OTE thinks getting conflict resolution quickly matters, so conflicts are a single, largely deterministic roll, and that impressing other players matters, so there are discression penalty/bonus dice.  GURPS thinks that realism matter, so there are a lot of rules that limit character by how "realistic" they are within the setting, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think there probably -are- several classes of rules.  There are "this shouldn't come up, don't worry about it" rules, like the gun rules in Pendragon.  There are "this is going to come up, but it's not that important, so here's a basic way to resolve it" rules, like secondary skills in AD&amp;D1.   There are "this is what the game is about, so we're going to give you rules that revolve around it" rules, like the stats in My Life With Master.  And then there are "This is so crucial to what the game is about that we're not going to give you rules that resolve it -- you have to just play it out."<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, there are also other rules -- Escalation in Dogs straddles the last two categories, as a rule-based decision that ends up lying with the player.                        </div>

It seems to me that this belies a strong preference for Design What Doesn't Matter -- you believe that there are things that are <em>so</em> important that you can't design rules to address or guide them, and this stuff has to be left up to "just playing it out."<br/><br/>Your characterization of OTE as emphasizing quick conflict resolution is tangled, as far as how I formulated the duology.  OTE isn't so much emphasizing something as avoiding something -- that being all those details that can "bog down" a resolution roll.  What the players in an actual game decide to emphasize in favor of those details is not directed by the game text, and is in fact up to the players.  That's a perfect description of Design What Doesn't Matter.<br/><br/>Similarly, I don't think any actual game of GURPS is about realism -- I think actual games of GURPS <em>utilize</em> realism to emphasize whatever it is they're after (challenge, story, kitbashing, exploration, exposition, whatever).  The multitude of rules in GURPS serve to provide the players with a solid baseline of "realistic" determinations so they can get on with what they're interested in.  Cause arguments over what's "realistic" in a game and what's not are Not Fun by nearly any definition.  These rules get rid of that for you.  That's Design What Doesn't Matter, again.<br/><br/>I'm really, really, <em>really</em> not trying to paint one philosophy as noble and the other as lazy.  In fact Design What Doesn't Matter is probably harder and more complex than Design What Does Matter, since there's simply more rules to write and balance and interrelate.  I am just starting to see how complex and interwoven these designs are, with a built-in expectation of players shifting emphases in actual play, and the system being robust enough to handle it.  That's a big job.<br/><br/>(<em>Are</em> there gun rules in Pendragon, or are you talking in terms of 'of course there isn't mention of guns in Pendragon'?)                        </div>

                            I'm mostly interested in the theory because it doesn't tie me down to designing a System That Matters, which I find extraordinarily limiting. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn't penalize me for asking the question, "Why am I including X design element?"<br/>
<br/>
I can design my game, and identify the parts that are there to <br/>
enhance the gaming aspect<br/>
smooth over nonessentials that can't really be "gamed" with<br/>
<br/>
The only example I can think of right now are the combat rules and the alignment rules for ADnD. ADnD was made for combat. That's the whole point. Armor, hit points, weapon speeds, blah blah. You're supposed to spend time fighting, and doing so with some intricacy. <br/>
<br/>
There's role playing too, but the only thing to support that is alignments -- a general guideline for your characters morality and temperament. There's no "game" around alignments. They're just a few on/off switches that gloss over an incredible amount of complexity and subjective interpretation. <br/>
<br/>
There's probably a lot of fuzzy thinking in this post. I apologize. I got a lot going on here, but I wanted to toss in my two bits.                        </div>

                            Don't mistake "Design What Doesn't Matter" with "System Doesn't Matter."  System does and will always matter -- the question is how it matters and what it does.  Going with Design What Doesn't Matter means that you're figuring out how to resolve things quickly and easily (and maybe throwing out little hooks of interesting but thematically insignificant details) so that you can facilitate the players doing their thing.  Design should still be a conscious process -- it's just bent towards a different goal.  That make sense?                        </div>

You want people to drive safely, in the middle of the roadway, right?<br/>

So, you could paint a sign on the pavement, every few miles, saying "Drive safely in the middle of the road, like so".  <br/>
<br/>
Or, you could post little signs every few miles, over the road and on the edges, that say things like "Don't drive faster than this", "Don't drive in this lane, not even a little", "Don't drive on the shoulder", "Don't turn around in the roadway", and so on...                        </div>

                            Okay, "Rumble" just said the first thing that really clicked for me in this whole discussion:<br>
<br>
"ADnD was made for combat. That's the whole point. Armor, hit points, weapon speeds, blah blah....There's no "game" around alignments. They're just a few on/off switches that gloss over an incredible amount of complexity and subjective interpretation."<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps:<br/>
<br/>
D&amp;D Combat is "there are lots of rules about this, because you're going to do it a lot."<br/>
D&amp;D Alignments are "we don't want you to waste time agonizing over moral dilemmas or killing monsters and taking their stuff is really the right thing to do, but this isn't a game about being crazed homicidal maniacs, either, you're supposed to feel like heroes; so we're going to give you an easy set of 'good guy' vs. 'bad guy' markers so you can get on with the killin'."<br/>
<br/>
As opposed to , where the tactical details of how you win the combat most effectively are so unimportant they're basically "make up whatever," but the Escalation and Fallout rules point you directly to what level of harm you are prepared to risk and inflict.                        </br></br></div>

                            You know, I've always had to wonder how much D&amp;D's history is responsible for DWDM's development. <br/><br/>There was a time when D&amp;D was pretty much a combat game, based around the gamist engine of dungeon destruction that is its greatest glory. The number of spells you could cast a day and how well you could hit AC -8 were what mattered, and everyone knew it. You had to max out your characters in order to live, and no one thought you were a twink for getting your attributes as high as possible. Hell, you even got XP bonuses for having high atts in the right places for your class. And once you got to high levels the game got harder, not easier. The high level dungeons were brutal, and unless you had mastery of all the resources at your disposal they'd screw you blue. (This is an amazing thing for someone who bought most of his D&amp;D adventures years later -- later adventures relied on neutralizing your powers to keep things "real" while the early classics set up situations that required you to use all your powers to survive. Go into a high level early dungeon without fly and teleport and a Rod of Lordly Might and you're boned.) <br/><br/>Then in the 80's there was this shift. I remember articles starting to show up in Dragon magazine about how the authors had never had a character above 5th level even though they'd had 3 year long games with the character, about how trying to get high attributes was twinkish and broken and missing the point, and about how to roleplay rather than rollplay. People were pretty obviously using D&amp;D for lots of things that weren't combat, weren't in the dungeon or even adventure focused, and things like character development, interpersonal relations, and politics were becoming the rage. (Personally, I blame Dragonlance. But then, I would.) Resource managment, tactics, and such were out. The D&amp;D spells that were orriginally designed to overcome challanges in dungeoun and adventuring environments were mocked, and new spells often had more to do with posing as the arcane and mysterious master of arcane mystery than on being effective in a tactical/strategic way. High level characters were pase. <br/><br/>Thing is, they were doing all of this while still using the same engine that was developed specifically for that tactically based dungeon crawling combat mayhem. Different editions would add skills and proficiencies in different ways (it started by defining which weapons you could use, and then moved into which cool tactical, survival, quest skills you could use, and ended with Diplomacy being a prime skill), but the basis of the system was still the hit points, the THAC0, the attacks per round and so on. So the folks who were using the system for other things had to develop skills in order to do them. They learned how to do the things that were important for them, how to get their Goldmoon on, without system support. <br/><br/>Over time, that became the default assumption of play for many, many people. You have a system that handles this combat stuff and that alignment stuff over there, so that you can get down to the nitty gritty soap-opera (for boys) that is one of the major reasons you're playing game. It was the skills of the people around the table that made it work, and the idea that similar structure could come from the game mechanics was pretty alien. This was the height of the era in which we'd hear games proclaim "rules that get out of the way so you can get on with what really matters!" DWDM was here to stay.<br/><br/>I think there is a real way in which we're still much in the legacy of D&amp;D being the biggest RPG on earth, even for play to which the mechanics give no respect or support.                        </div>

This was the height of the era in which we'd hear games proclaim "rules that get out of the way so you can get on with what really matters!" DWDM was here to stay.</blockquote>
I agree with most of this assessment of AD&amp;D, but given this definition, I think DWDM is just a term for <i>bad design</i>.  Joshua BR's original post had various verbiage that DWDM is some sort of valid alternative, but what you (Brand) are talking about is a plain mistake.  <br/><br/>Good games don't do this, and never have.  Champions is not a game about sitting around and talking in coffeeshops -- it is about heroes and villains fighting.  That's what the mechanics support.  The same goes for all the other good game designs of the past, like James Bond 007, Toon, Ars Magica, and so forth.                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>I think it most often is bad design as well. However, it can also be seen as designing to the skill sets "most" RPGers have. Most D&amp;D influenced gamers I've seen are actually pretty good at doing lots of their story-generation stuff themselves, even though they do it at an unacknowledged level. (That level brings them lots of problems when they play certain Nar games with strong story control elements, because they can't "just do it" the way they always have.) <br/><br/>If those folks want games that let them use their own systems to handle those things, then desigining  games that leave free space for those systems is a good thing. <br/><br/>The reason I think it normally becomes "bad design" is because most designers of this type of game don't know that they're doing that, or at best don't know exactly why or how they're doing it. They have vauge ideas about "the system getting out of the way" but are often unclear about what the system is, what it should do, and why it should get out of the way. More understanding of group dynamics and the way people use game material can probably help with that. <br/><br/>Of course, one could argue that we've already seen that starting. Josh and Ben have argued, for example, that PTA is DWDM -- and Josh has said the Pool and (possibly) HeroQuest are as well. In those games there is not a lot in the game that drives you towards anything specific. They'll all push you towards conflicts, and all of them give you a method of structuring the game via those conflicts and have systems that act (in different ways) as conflict structuring and resolution mechanics. So for those games what "matters" is "having a way to structure the game and resolve conflicts in a way that allows for all conflicts to be given equal weight and game focus." All of those games are designe for that, very strongly. However, because they aren't designed for one single thing (like judgement in Dogs, trust in Moutain Witch) they don't fit into the narrow-band definition of DWM. <br/><br/>Which leads me to speculate we have different levels of "what matters" going on. Dogs is a very DWM game because it pushes the whole thing at you in one kit. You will be a Dog. You will go into towns full of sin. You will judge the sin. Everything in the game is setup to do that, to push that, to yank and pull and push and make you ask the questions the game has on it's back cover text. Very, very specific and very designed to do what matters. Heroquest, otoh, just has you set up to be fantastic heroes in a world that is dying/changing between ages. What part of the world, what the setup of your game, what stakes you'll be fighting for, and all that is all up to your group. You decided that by what abilities you take and what contests you push. But (big but) the games mechanics are set up very strongly to push for a structured conflict in wich any answer can be a valid way of dealing with the world, and in which your actions must change the world. <br/><br/>So is it really a design for what doesn't matter? Heroquest will push your play, it will force things to move around its resolution system. Ditto the Pool. OTOH, Blue Rose (for example) will not have a similar effect upon play. Blue Rose has romantic fantasy at its heart, but very few rules that push for romantic fantasy in structure or color. Blue Rose doesn't structure play the way Heroquest, the Pool, and PTA do. It just sits there waiting for you to use it to run combat, determine sorcery power levels, and maybe do a Diplomacy roll or three -- while you structure the narrative, figure out the player's conflicts without flags, and use your players not-in-the-book system to make it work or not.<br/><br/>So, I think we've got to figure out how "focused" and "not focused" fit into "what matters" and "what doesn't matter" -- becuase it isn't a one to one correlation and I think the cross over is screwing up our stance.                        </div>

                            John<br/><br/>I <strong>strongly</strong> object to classifying DWDM as bad design. <br/><br/>Over the Edge is completely given over to DWDM. <br/><br/>Nothing matters in OtE except for the solitary truth of your own character, as you, the player, conceived and wrote it.* There are no mechanics to guide how important your important person is, how cagey you (have to) play your secret, or even a consistent way to describe or compare two different characters with traits that manifest in very similar ways. <br/><br/>And for all that, I think you'll be hard pressed to find many people whose first reaction towards OtE is "bad game design."<br/><br/> *Notwithstanding GM approval, of course.                        </div>

                            Hm.  There's a definitional thing here.  It's not that I don't like or don't understand DWDM -- it's that I have a problem with the definition.  For example, I don't particularly like GURPS as a game design (at least prior to 4th edition which I'm not familiar with), but it's not because I don't understand it.  I also feel that the parts of it I dislike are mostly bad design rather than personal quirks of mine.  <br/><br/>This isn't that I dislike non-focused games.  I'm a fan of the Hero System, for example.  But I like it for what it does well, not as a system to ignore in play.  As for Over the Edge -- I'm not a fan of it, but to the extent that it is good design, it is so by <i>both</i> de-emphasizing what isn't important and emphasizing what is important.  <br/><br/>If we want to hold DWDM games as a valid, good game design, then people have to pick good games which they actively enjoy as their DWM and DWDM examples.  Brand, I'm talking to you here.  <br/><br/><b>Brand_Robins</b> wrote:
<blockquote>I think it most often is bad design as well. However, it can also be seen as designing to the skill sets "most" RPGers have. Most D&amp;D influenced gamers I've seen are actually pretty good at doing lots of their story-generation stuff themselves, even though they do it at an unacknowledged level. (That level brings them lots of problems when they play certain Nar games with strong story control elements, because they can't "just do it" the way they always have.) <br/><br/>If those folks want games that let them use their own systems to handle those things, then desigining games that leave free space for those systems is a good thing. </blockquote>
Do you like your DWDM examples, Brand (i.e. Blue Rose and/or GURPS)?  My impression is not, and I think that's badly coloring the conversation here.  Consider: how would you feel if someone picked badly-designed story games and used them as examples to generalize about "Design What Matters"?                        </div>

                            Rob, <br/><br/>Cool post. It pretty much fits with my memories of the time, and of Dragonlance. <br/><br/>John Kim, <br/><br/>I don't like GURPS. I have mixed feelings about Blue Rose. Blue Rose I think is actually a well designed DWDM game, I just happen to not like it as much because these days I want games that DWM, or at least design to give game structure. <br/><br/>However, I have lots of friends that LOVE Blue Rose and LOVE GURPS, and so I'm trying to talk from their experiences and the things they've told me about why they like those systems. I have a hard time with games that are both not focused and not designed to what matters (so GURPS is in my "right out" list) -- and so my pull for the one side is pulling for a team I'm not on, I guess. <br/><br/>OTOH, I'm still not real sure about Heroquest, the Pool, OTE, or PTA being "DWDM" -- they all feel DWM to me. Very much so. Just with the M on the structure of system rather than the details of setting and color.<br/><br/>EDIT: Probably part of my problem with the discussion is that it's drifted a lot from my initial thoughts on the matter. A few months ago on RPG.net (and a month or so ago here) I talked about games that give you a system that structures your play for a particular result vs. games that do not because they assume that you will structure your own play with your non-mechanical lumpley-system elements. Under that definition the Pool, for example, is clearly sturctured (it tells you how to play in a real way) while Blue Rose isn't.  Josh, however, has taken that a different direction and I'm not always sure we're on the same page anymore.                        </div>

                            One thing that's hampering discussion here is the conflation of 'game' and 'book'.<br/><br/>Other Joshua said:<br/><code>I retain my skepticism until the time that I play one such game that, when the rules are followed, works.</code><br/><br/>Which is just the thing -- Design What Doesn't Matter doesn't work by you reading the book and following the rules in the book and no others.  Design What Doesn't Matter works by you sitting down with your friends and using your social contract level rules for determining What Matters and letting the published material handle What Doesn't Matter.  Joshua, your demand is like saying "I won't ride one of them bicycles till it moves on its own."  The rules provided in the book are not meant to stand on their own.<br/><br/>If you want to play one such game, you need to get a functional group together or join an existing one and learn how they function.  If that seems like a lot of work to you, well, that's one of the benefits of Design What Matters -- you can sit down with strangers to play it.<br/><br/>John, I love both GURPS and Blue Rose, and it is Blue Rose, in fact, that led me to the conclusion that it was following a different design philosophy that what's espoused at the Forge and in the Power 19 and suchlike.  So I took a hard look at it and then I took a hard look at AP reports of it on the Green Ronin boards.  It's always been plain that the players were importing a lot of assumptions into their play, but then it finally clicked that <em>that was the point</em>.  It's an actual case of "It's not a bug, it's a feature."                        </div>

                            You write the rules because every group is going to have a different definition of What Matters and What Doesn't in a DWDM game.  For some groups, the copy machine may be hugely important, while for others it might just need to get dealt with easily and unimportantly in the background.  (And, for the record, I would argue that it's the latter groups who are more likely to actually use copy machine rules as opposed to build their own social contract around the copy machine.)<br/>
<br/>
As for how you decide what rules to provide?  You got me there - I have no idea.  I think that's part of why DWDM is so hard.                        </div>

                            No one's answered this question: why am I bothering to roll dice for something I don't care about?<br/><br/>Your social contract rules, if written down, would make a decent game text. So, assuming that they're good rules, you can play a good game with them. I agree.As a designer, you're leaving out the good part there, since if you wrote down good social contract rules, you'd have a good rule text. But that's not the purpose of this here Gedankenexperiment<br/><br/>So you're saying to use your socially agreed system of rules Ã¢â‚¬â€ whatever the written text says Ã¢â‚¬â€ to do things that don't matter, that don't have consequence to your perspective, your story, right?<br/><br/>So why do you have those rules at all?<br/><br/>Or are you saying to have lots of different sets of rules that you can choose from for a given setting? Cuz I can totally get behind that.<br/><br/>But the idea of bothering with rules for things that I explicitly don't care about, so that I can use my relationships with my friends for the stuff I do? No.<br/><br/>Several people here are saying that this "philosophy" of design is hard to instantiate.<br/><br/>Rise to that challenge. Put your money where your mouth is. Show that this isn't a straw man for "System Doesn't Matter" by writing a system that makes this work. If you can't trust <i>my</i> group to have a functional social contract, you can't trust any. So let's see this down on the table. 
<blockquote>Design What Doesn't Matter doesn't work by you reading the book and following the rules in the book and no others.</blockquote>
That's not an excuse. Give me rules I would want to use for the game with a setting compelling enough to care about it and I'll play!                        </div>

                            Joshua, <br/><br/>You will never find that game because you do not play that way. Your argument is like an atheist telling a bishop that he'll belive in God as soon as God answers his prayers (that he doesn't make.) <br/><br/>Why would people roll dice for something they don't care about? <br/><br/>Because they do care about it, but don't care about it as their primary goal. Vampire, the game of politics and personal horror has lots of players rolling to see if they hit you in the head with a 2x4. They do care if they hit you, but (contrary to the idealogy of many of us who think paradigmatically differently) they don't care about it the most. They only give the dice things they have interest, but not investment, in. Things they are invested in they deal with through their "other system." This is because, as WW guys like Malcom have noted, in WW style systems the primary reason you go to the dice is to surrender control to a random determiner. (As opposed to gamist games and macho nar games where rolling is actually a way to -gain control-.) <br/><br/>Because they're in a sim head space where they want things to feel real. Vermisilitude is important to lots of folks, and they go about getting it by a sort of dice-regulated naturalism that seems odd and akward to you and me -- but that seems fully natural to them. <br/><br/>Because that's the way they've always played, and belive it or don't from your horse they actually like the results they get. I know, seems odd -- but people like to do shit differently. <br/><br/>Because they aren't trying to tell a story or step on up. They could be trying to inhabit their characters, or confront the existential dillema of life through the softening filter of play, or just waste time with their friends or a lot of other things. If their logical substructure of gaming is fundementally different than yours then it is mathmatical that their conclusions about what they want from gaming will be different than yours as well. <br/><br/>And so the arguments go. But let me guess -- none of these have sold you on the idea, have they? <br/><br/>For my part, I think it's less about DWM and DWDM than it is about what you are actually designing when you design your game. Monolith or Void. <br/><br/>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about if you deisgn to encorporate the monolith of assumed structures and methods of play or to create a system that forces a certain style of play areound a void. Do you make your game with the assumption that people already know how to play it and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be forced to change their structure, or do you make your game so that playing it by the rules forces a certain kind of play with specific kinds of results?<br/><br/>Does your game rely on the assumed structure of Ã¢â‚¬Å“this is how RPGs are playedÃ¢â‚¬Â or does it tell your players how to play their game? <br/><br/>Blue Rose, for example, assumes that the people reading it already know how to run and play their games. The system, the advice in the book, and all the rest are set up quite deliberatly to be props for a thing that the folks around the table are already doing. The reason it gets rid of the crunch of D&amp;D (which for a gamist is the point of D&amp;D) is because that crunch gets in the way of the monolith of semi-Sim play that Blue Rose assumes. In so doing it creates a system that is very clean and supportive for people who already know how to play it. <br/><br/>Dogs, otoh, assumes that people reading it need to know how to play Dogs. It tells you specifically and point by point how to play and how not to play. It has rules that "get in the way" because those rules are designed to force you into a particular stance and to yeild particular results. It forces the creation of a void that will be filled by the players following its structure of play. In so doing it creates a system that is very clean and supportive for people who are willing to put aside externals and play the game in the book. <br/><br/>Now, paradigmatically I know which type of game I like more. I know what type of game you like more. I'm sure we could make many strong and logical points about why our anti-Monolith campaign is the right way for everyone to think. But in the end that doesn't make us right. And even if we are right it doesn't mean that the other mode of thought doesn't exist. <br/><br/>It does. A lot of game designers aren't designing to force you to play their game, they're designing support for the game you're already playing. <br/><br/>P.S. As for why they don't just do settings alone -- its because they don't sell. For whatever reason, folks want the system to go with their setting, even if the system is pretty much what they already have. For my thoughts on why that might be, I'll point you in the way back machine to my Yud's Dice post about Screwdrivers: <a href="http://yudhishthirasdice.blogspot.com/2005/06/right-tool-for-right-job.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://yudhishthirasdice.blogspot.com/2005/06/right-tool-for-right-job.html</a> </div>

This is a valid <i>goal</i> for any RPG rule system I got no beef with it. I think Dogs is actually really good at it. We're talking about techniques here, though, not goals. We're talking about writing down the processes that are effective so that others can use them.<br/><br/>Representation of the environment is a concern I have with a lot of rule systems. I totally follow that some rules should help you approach consensus about the nature of your fictional environment.<br/><br/>(This has nothing to do with sim.)<br/><br/>As for your other examples, "inhabiting a character" is really "inhabiting a character you're interested in." There's something you like about that guy that makes you want to be him in a story. That's confronting theme. <br/><br/>Hangin' out with your friends, yeah, that's pure social contract stuff. I understand what you're talking about there. But I think that, if social contract rules were the way to make meaningful, controversial stuff happen, Robert wouldn't have written his Rules.<br/><br/>Part of my objection to this is that it's not saying anything new. It's the same argument that so many make all the time: The Rules Should Get Out Of The Way. It's an argument against innovation by calling the non-design that's so common in our  medium "Design What Doesn't Matter".
<blockquote> You will never find that game because you do not play that way.</blockquote>
So... this game can't be designed, bought, or played by me? You can understand my skepticism.<br/><br/>I bet I've played as many RPGs as you, man. A lot of homebrews, FUDGE, GURPS, Warhammer, Cyberpunk, and other bits. We used our social contracts to make stuff work in all those games. I know how it works. I've GMed for and played with people I loved and trusted, and with those I didn't. I found them to be uniformly weaker experiences than rules that drive conflict.<br/><br/>Can other people like other techniques? Sure! But you're proposing that this is a <i>design decision</i> to not give people rules for working stuff out. <i>Players</i> can ignore rules all they like. That's their prerogative, with whatever results they come up with. But we're talking about design here. There's a difference between minimalism and underdesign, and I think you're confusing one with the other.                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>You said: "There's a difference between minimalism and underdesign, and I think you're confusing one with the other."<br/><br/>I don't think that I'm confusing anything at all. I'm pretty clear about where I stand and what I want in a game. <br/><br/>I am, however, trying to explain why other designers chose to design as they do without just saying "they're dumb and don't know what they're doing." I think they are making a choice, deliberatly and with knowledge, in order to give people games that those people have repeatedly said that they want. <br/><br/>Now, as for this being "system doesn't matter" it isn't. It is, however, "lumpley system matters where mechanics in the game book may not." <br/><br/>Pretty much, the DWDM folks are designing for system to matter: but they are designing for system to matter this way: <br/><br/><img alt="Vincents System diagram" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysgurpsrules.gif" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>While DWM folks are designing for system to matter this way: <br/><br/><img alt="Vincents System diagram" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/sysideal.gif" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>(Hell, even the fact that Vincent calls the later "system ideal" where as many readers rebel against the notion that everything by the book is any kind of "ideal" shows that we've got a paradigmatic split.) <br/><br/>Now if you want to talk about whether this choice, and the fact that so many people want games like that, causes more problems than it solves -- that's an argument worth having. I'd personally say that at the very least DWDM is not helpful in getting newbs into the game because you have to know how to play already in order to play. This is a problem, and a big one. It also sort of highlight the reason why the Origins Awards have looked like they have for the last several years (lots of DWDM, no innovation, and a failing game market). <br/><br/>DWDM also brings us to the issue of "making games to sell to people who already play" vs. "making games to sell to people who don't already play" vs. "making games for people who play like I do" vs. "making games for anyone" and all the rest of that cluster of goals, marketing, and design that has FUBARed our hobby for so long. I do think that DWDM is a valid tool for selling "mainstream" games to people who already play in that tight cluster of "this is what RPGs are" land -- but I don't know that its a good long term survival strategy, nor is it one that I've a lot of interest in doing myself. (Or that is to say, I already do it myself as a freelancer and so when I do my own games I want to do something very different.) <br/><br/>OTOH, if people already know how to play something and just want to play something like what they already know, then who the fuck are we to tell them that their play and games designed to support that play aren't any good? Any good by whose standards? Ours? Sure, but then they don't give a fuck about our standards, and why should they? <br/><br/>Maybe we can give them some good reasons, but the thing is, in order to have that conversation you have to admit that people are making a choice when they design one way or the other, and not just defaulting because they're ignorant.                        </div>

Arg.  See, I'm unlike Joshua Newman in that I like a lot of traditional games -- but I'm in agreement with his point here.  What's wrong with the Origins Awards is bad design and a lack of recognition of bad design (which feed each other, incidentally).  That's not "Design What Doesn't Matter" as a valid philosophy of how to build a game... it's just plain suckitude.  <br/><br/>The fact that there are some bad mechanics design that do well in the marketplace (due to setting design, artwork, packaging, licensing tie-ins, and so forth) doesn't mean that bad mechanics are better than good mechanics.  It is exactly this broken attitude which led to the crappy approaches like "story-oriented" AD&amp;D2 and various nineties failures.  <br/><br/>All things being equal, a good design will win out.  That isn't a Narrativist thing -- it's a basic fact.  There is nothing about verisimilitude or the Sim head space which are different on this front.  If I want immersive verisimilitude, I want mechanics which support and enhance that.  I don't want mechanics which do shit that I don't care about.                        </div>

                            Ah. The last few posts, and particularly John's, have helped me identify my position. <br/>
<br/>
I'm puzzled at why people are equating DWDM with bad design. <br/>
<br/>
RPGs constrained to DWM restrict my area/scope of play. I might as well be playing a board game. I like board games, so this isn't a bad thing, in and of itself. But most often I can't play a purely DWM game at all unless I understand the rules, and if I don't understand the rules well, I may in fact be at a disadvantage, manifested as incompetence or awkwardness. Rules are required, and facilitate a specifiy method of play. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, RPGs constrained to DWDM leave me with the full range of possibilities. If I just want to sit down and play, I can. The other players will pick up the slack, and facilitate my play. I can focus on what really matters to me, and probably even other's enjoyment of the game. The mechanics exist precisely to handle non-essentials that must somehow be resolved. Rules are a necessary evil here. <br/>
<br/>
If everyone is doing what they care about, and everyone is having a good time, does it really matter whether or not they have to use a rule to effect what they care about?                        </div>

                            Brand, the use of Vincent's diagrams is very useful. And they make me agree even more with Joshua ACN when he calls DWDM "non-design." That segues into Rumble's post. There shouldn't be a question of having rules or not, if by rules you mean system (and I'm thinking you are meaning that): you always have system, it's just a matter of whether it's written down, or whether you have to work it out during play informally; and we can agree that there may be hazards and virtues in doing that.<br/><br/>The main thing, for me, is that DWDM doesn't seem to qualify as a philosophy of <em>system</em> design, except by neglect: it's a philosophy of product creation that sets out to provide only a small part of the system. That may be skilled marketing, and it may produce a product that sells, but it isn't great system design -- the real system design, whether it's great or not,  is mostly done by each individual group.<br/><br/>Maybe this last part is just symmantics...but I think it has a point. While I like to be as inclusive as the next guy, I'm unwilling to put the traditional "DWDM" approach on equal footing with our newfangled, critical, examined-design approach. Maybe it produces fine products that people are happy with (and can use to do good role-playing), but it's not the same kind of thing. Maybe no one was ever saying it was.                        </div>

                            Rumble, what focused-design games have you played? Or is this a hypothetical concern? This is a concern for <i>designers</i>, not players.<br/><br/>Brand, let's list the things that DWDM rules Ã¢â‚¬â€ really, I mean rules; the stuff you follow Ã¢â‚¬â€ can do. I bet there's stuff that the rules do that's interesting and worth picking up the dice/writing stuff down/looking up a table for, and I bet it Matters.<br/><br/>Answers I'd respect as valid reasons to follow the rules<br/>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Drawing the world (which happens in Shock: anyway, as a Rule That Matters)<br/>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ _______________ (you fill in the rest. I want to know what, precisely, you're thinking)<br/><br/>Answers I wouldn't<br/>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Bringing the players in line with the story (this sucks for reasons everyone here understands)<br/>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Reinforcing the pecking order of the players (like we need new ways to determine who gets which seat)<br/>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A method of pacing ("stalling" rarely leads to an exciting, interesting story)<br/>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A way for players to show their knowledge of the system (if the system isn't interesting, neither is this)<br/><br/>John said,
<blockquote> All things being equal, a good design will win out. That isn't a Narrativist thing -- it's a basic fact. </blockquote>
This is a basic article of faith for me, and one of the few I hold. It's a matter of faith for me because it will be some time before I see a statistically significant degree of success in my own games.<br/><br/>But, as another data point, Dogs in the Vineyard has not seen the success it's seen because it's a Western game about Mormon clerical marshals. It's gotten that success because it's well designed.<br/><br/>Quoting myself,
<blockquote> I've GMed for and played with people I loved and trusted, and with those I didn't. I found them to be uniformly weaker experiences than rules that drive conflict.<br/></blockquote>
I want to clarify that: I've had some <i>really</i> good roleplaying experiences using social contract, sometimes without a die hitting the table. The best of those  experiences in my 20 years or so of roleplaying were as good as 75% of my experiences using focused systems.  An additional 20% of my focused game play is better than those sessions, and the remaining 5% is crap: unfocused players, or arguments, or whatever that stunk up the session, irrespective of rules being used. But when these games broke down, it's because the rules for What Matters weren't being used.<br/><br/>Fred, that's an incisive question.                        </div>

                            There seems to be a rule that Joshuas cannot agree in this thread, since I disagree with both JBR and JN.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortuantely, I don't have that much time/energy to address this, but I'll try.<br/>
<br/>
First, I'm left after the later discussion not knowing what DWDM is supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
My first comments were on the idea of it being a concept of designing systems for resolving things that needed to be dealt with, but which were not the expected focus of the game.<br/>
<br/>
However, later venn diagrams seem to point more to "present a basic design, then fall back on the social contract or systems people come up with in play to handle the rest of play". <br/>
<br/>
Are these the same things?<br/>
<br/>
That said...<br/>
<br/>
JBR: I have a strong preference for what you refer to as DWDM games; in general, light task resolution systems in the confines of a social game with a strong GM working within a strong social contract works for me, while most of our experiments with Forge style nar games were noble failures (tried: Polaris (sort of), Capes, PTA, Sorceror (Success!  But Sorceror is closer to OTE than most, and we were fighting the system all the way)).  By contrast, most of our other games are built around the OTE resolution system, and work well, with few if any growing pains.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not convinced that you're adequately expressed your point -- nor that DWDM is quite the right description thereof.  I'm half convinced that this is because while DWM is a good description, DWDM isn't.  Maybe it should be DDWM instead?<br/>
<br/>
Let's take OTE vs D&amp;D.  D&amp;D has never really worked for us.  We're currently playing in a too-large D&amp;D game which is fun-ish, but it doesn't really fulfil my need to roleplay (nor Lisa's) any more than a DWM game does.  To a large degree, this is because D&amp;D is very good at driving play to what it does well, providing reward systems that support it, and rules systems that focus play around it.  In many ways, D&amp;D is the big daddy of DWM games, and I think the literature supports this (see how Ron talks about D&amp;D regarding reward systems).<br/>
<br/>
OTE, on the other hand, has more or less always worked for us, and brilliantly.  We dropped the extra rules that were added to make it publishable (hit points, psi pools, etc) early, but the system does what it's designed for very well: it handles the things we don't want to without interfering with anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this said, naturally, our play in OTE (keeping in mind that we've used the system for fantasy, for James H. Schmitz style SF, for Cthulhupunk, and even to play OTE) is very different than our play in PTA, or even Sorceror.  Sometimes we end up with characters resolving inner conflicts and making decisions that shake the fate of the world.  Sometimes we end up playing out a minor mystery or having a "session" which consists of characters planning out a wedding.  Sometimes things stall, or act wierdly -- we had a mystery take three times as long as it probably should have because we couldn't figure out where things should go, and I occasionally end driting away for a while as two players spend an hour or two talking about things that don't interest me.  But then we talk about things and put them back on course, and, well, it's still all good.<br/>
<br/>
One point that seems to show up here is that when we sit down to play, we don't know what will matter.  And you know what?  That's pretty cool.  I know people talk about how DWM design can push people into places they wouldn't normally go (and it can), but it can also keep people in one place rather than letting them move about more freely.  This is why I'm beginning to think that DDWM is much better than DWDM is -- it's not that you're designing what doesn't matter so much that you're designing things that are expected to want to be handled by the non-social system, and that rather than using this as a method of determining what matters in the game, you're avoiding predetermining same.  It might be that what matters is who your Most Important Person (a required OTE character determination, if one with no mechanical result) is.  Or it might not...but it's play that will determine what matters, rather than the book-system.<br/>
<br/>
Another is that we don't rely on the rules to avoid having issues, but we acknowledge that like any other relationship, there will be issues, and that like any other relationship, we'll work the issues out socially...and that in general, such issues are managable.<br/>
<br/>
A third is this seems to tie in some ways into what I discuss in http://community.livejournal.com/labcats/7670.html ("RPGs and Martial Arts") -- that like a decent MA system, a properly designed game (for me, anyway) should be able to be internalized (even if that's "eventually internalized"), so that you can have the system be a matter of trained behaviors which don't hit the concious interface while they're being used.  You can't properly fight while you're paying attention to the rules of the contest, or planning out your next three actions, or deciding on what line your attack will be in.  Instead, all of these things have to be so well trained that they're internalized -- so you can get on with the business of fighting.  Are RPGs any different? If so, why?<br/>
<br/>
(Note that there are a couple of quick questions to be answered here: Are RPGs any different from conversations (and why)?  Are RPGs any different from martial arts (and why)?)<br/>
<br/>
Um.  For miscelania:<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I was saying that Pendragon doesn't have gun rules because guns are not expected to appear in the game.  It doesn't need rules for this because the rule -- implied or stated -- is that "there are no guns".  This is different from D&amp;D3 not having persuasion rules (and IIRC, not letting Bluff and Diplomacy) for people trying to persuade PCs -- because it's not that the rule is "people will never try to persuade PCs" but that "A PC will never be pursuaded unless the player decides the PC is persuaded."<br/>
<br/>
Leaving DDWM aside for that moment, I'd like to talk about DWDM, or what I pulled out of that concept -- the idea of designing with negative space.  This is, I think, a different concept than DDWM (if one that isn't entirely unrelated), but I'm not entirely sure how it works or how to address it.                        </div>

                            Yes -- I expanded it above (I understand reluctance to read a long post).  Another useful back formation is "Don't Determine What Matters".  The point being that you're not designing stuff that doesn't matter; you're designing -some- stuff that matters...but not attempting to determine What Matters via the design process.                        </div>

<code>Is there a style of play that can only be achieved by playing a DWDM game?</code><br/><br/>That's a sort of unfair question (but only sort of), and I can only answer it by twisting the question slightly.  It's sort of unfair because it assumes the "find target, hit target" design philosophy of DWM and then asks if DWDM can do the same, which it pretty explicitly doesn't do.<br/><br/>There isn't "a" style of play out there that only DWDM can do, but there are <em>groups of players</em> out there for whom DWDM products fit their needs.  These are groups that already know what they want out of the game experience -- they know how their characters interact, how their stories progress, how many combat scenes to balance against the talking scenes.  What they need from a published book is rules for how superpowers work, or how swordfights work, or an engaging setting/situation to put their characters in.  Once they have this stuff, they can then incorporate it into their normal, habitual, and practiced means of play.  What they are looking for in a product is not instructions, but support; they don't want Adobe Photoshop (they already have a graphics program), they want a package of stock photos or a couple plug-ins.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense whatsoever?  It's Monday.                        </div>

<br/>
A DWM game is a finely-tuned machine that is designed to do one thing well.<br/>
<br/>
A DWDM game is a BIIIG bag of parts.  It has more parts than a DWM game but it's less functional as written.                        </div>

                            JoshuaACN: Should I be offended, confused, or indifferent? I've opted for forthcoming. :)<br/>
<br/>
You wrote: "Rumble, what focused-design games have you played? Or is this a hypothetical concern? This is a concern for designers, not players."<br/>
<br/>
1) I've got a few games under my belt that I'd call focused design. Whether anyone agrees that they are such is another question: octaNe (player/GM), Donjon (GM), Otherkind (GM), Dead of Night (GM), Jenga-Dread  (player). There's probably a few more, but those are the ones that pop into my head at the moment. I wish it were more, but I haven't had a lot of opportunity to RP lately, and I'm in the process of writing my second game, so I'm actually actively avoiding playing/reading other RPGs. <br/>
<br/>
Dead of Night is my first published game (from Steampower Publishing). It's a traditional game with enough twists that players can easily segue into non-traditional gaming without realizing it. <br/>
<br/>
2) I think the concern you're referring to is my comment on everyone doing what they care about, but I wasn't sure. Assuming that was what you were referring to, it is indeed a genuine concern, not a hypothetical one.<br/>
<br/>
3) Lastly, what is the "this" in your third sentence? You lost me there. Are you referring to the same concern, or the  overarching topic of DWM vs. DWDM (plus DDWM, now)?<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I think I can safely answer that the *process* of design is a designer issue only if you use that particular process, but design itself is always a player issue because the players must deal with the results/consequences of the design process. To clarify: there's more than one design process. For a particular designer, only the design process is only significant if that is the design process you use. But regardless of your design process, you must always keep your players in mind. I suppose you could design for just yourself, but there's very little point.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't know if I'm taking DWDM where JoshuaBR intended it to go, but I don't think DDWM is the same thing as DWDM.<br/>
<br/>
When I think Design with a capital D, I think rules, not setting/fluff.<br/>
<br/>
It's VERY easy to design rules that matter. The hard part is your epiphany in the design process. You're defining your workspace and drawing the bounding box, trapping your audience in the game you've designed. (How's that for loaded language? 8-D)<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty easy to not design rules that matter. The hard part is relinquishing control over that aspect of "your" game, and turning that control over to your audience. You spec the game to your audience, but they get to draw the bounding box. \ <br/>
<br/>
It's pretty easy to design setting that doesn't matter. Unless you completely intertwine the system with the setting so that the system cannot be used without the setting, and the setting simply won't fully function without the sum of its parts, players can drop setting bits as they see fit, exactly because they don't matter. Computer games fall firmly into this category of design -- especially those damnable Zork-type games, where I'm Punching Wall and it can't find Wall even though Wall is in the description text. Those old Central Casting books are a great example of this as well. <br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that it's pretty hard to design rules that really don't matter. In essence, you mustn't think of the white horse. Once you design a rule, players tend to focus on it -- after all, you provided the rule. Once they focus on it, there's the danger that they will (want to) make it matter. Perhaps that means that Design that Doesn't Matter is purely in the eye of the beholder, but I'm not sure I believe that. <br/>
DWDM requires a different sort of epihany than DWM. Instead of, "Wow, this rule perfectly accomplishes what I want to do," you receive a revelation of "Wow, this is perfectly useless, but it's so very cool! I'll enjoy it when I can." Kinda like a lava lamp. :) With DWDM, you spec the game to your audience, and then when they need to resolve something that is not the focus of the game, they don't have to spend time figuring out how. <br/>
<br/>
I apologize for this example coming out of left field, but it's late, and this is the best I can do: <br/>
Cell phone construction and marketing is purely a matter of poor DWDM.  The only things that really matter about a cell phone are whether it will dial numbers, maintain a solid connection, and support phone-related contact data. It's a phone, after all. But they pile on feature after irrelevant feature until the basic functions of a phone takes a back seat to form factor, cameras, mp3 players, and so on. On my last attempt to upgrade phones, I ended up with a model which had no option to turn off the camera! The damn thing kept taking pictures of the inside of my pocket. <br/>
<br/>
Good DWDM would give me a great basic phone that I would simply take for granted. At my leisure then, I'd be able to enjoy the extras as the need/opportunity arose. <br/>
<br/>
I'm still thinking about my game collection to see if I have a better example of DWDM than the alignments from ADnD and the OtE system.                        </div>

                            Doesn't that Cell Phone analogy just point out the ways that DWM is superior, in the general, tabula rasa, case? <br/>
<br/>
If you want a good Cell Phone, for people who actually want a Cell Phone, that is what you design - a portable communications device and its user interface.<br/>
The idea is that the team that pours all of its energy into making a better phone will make a better phone than the (equally capable) team that splits its energy between the phone and a camera.<br/>
<br/>
But people who actually want a portable camera? They'll get the second phone, anyway...<br/>
<br/>
It sure seems to me that any and all DWDM (or DDWM) is *really* "only" game supplement material - just that in most cases the game it is attempting to supplement is a unique individual creation used by a single little group of people. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can expect that most of these "unique games" that players have constructed for themselves over the years do indeed fall into discernable categories that one can then focus a DWDM product on. <br/>
<br/>
So, yes, DWDM is attempting to avoid the constraints that DWM cherishes, but the *why* of that comes about because DWDM is aimed *only* at people who already know how to play, who already have a way to play. <br/>
<br/>
Does that help clarify things that have been said any?                        </div>

                            I can see a few approaches for people who already know what they want:<br/>
<br/>
So, there's "Toolkit Design".  The clearest example is Fudge.  Fudge doesn't tell you how to do things.  It gives at least three different suggestions of how it might be done, and requires the group to choose.  Many people found this useful as a design checklist of a sort, but it's clearly not a game which will push you in a particular direction.  This supports people who have a strong idea of what they want by allowing them to select rules that work for them.  <br/>
<br/>
There's also "Minimalist Design".  This is making a game where the rules are so short and broad that it leaves most of what happens in the game undefined.  Over the Edge and The Pool would be good examples.  Everway is a likely case of this as well.  Particularly with a short rules set, it's also easy to change existing rules.  For example, several people stated that they allowed more non-PC-action, director-stance statements in Dogs.  <br/>
<br/>
Neither of these are "Design What Doesn't Matter".  Rather, they're designing for pieces of the game rather than the whole of the game.  Fudge isn't just "ignore the rules".  For example, we did a number of tests of the different combat options as part of development.  But it's designing a small piece of the game rather than the whole.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't see GURPS as any of the above (Toolkit, Minimalist, or DWDM).  My experience with GURPS has been that the players tend to be by-the-book.  They like their crunchy hex-based combat, and they follow the spirit of the rules and generally the letter as well.  I understand that there are a number of people who play for GURPS simply because of the sourcebooks, and ignore most rules.  That would be using it as toolkit design, but I don't think that's how GURPS was intended.                        </div>

                            GURPS is very much toolkit design.  The books are full of optional rules, things that can be bolted on or stripped off of what is, at its core, a very light system.  GURPS Lite is what, eight pages?  It just happens to give you a fair bit of instruction as to when and how to bolt the pieces together, more than any other game of its type.  Perhaps the fact that it does the toolkit SO well, distinguishes it significantly from other toolkit games that simply can't measure up, that it is hard to lump together with them.<br/>
<br/>
Is Champions/Hero System a toolkit game?  I'd say that it shares a lot in common with GURPS.                        </div>

The current GURPS Lite is 32 pages, and moreover it isn't the same as full GURPS.  There are many, many rules in GURPS that are not labelled as "Optional" which are not included in GURPS Lite, so really the Lite rules are a separate game.  I would say that by having vastly more instructions about how to bolt the pieces together, it is no longer a do-it-yourself toolkit in the same way as Fudge.  It is customizable, but <i>all</i> RPGs are customizable -- D&amp;D, HeroQuest, Sorcerer, and many other games have been adapted to do different settings and genres.  <br/><br/>So, for example, I can in principle play a game using either Over the Edge or GURPS.  I think that these will feel different in play -- at least as much as the difference between, say, The Pool and Primetime Adventures.  These are all broad focus games, but each will influence what the game is like in play.                        </div>

                            Sempiternity: <br/>
<br/>
I'm not having a problem with clarity. I seem to be having a problem communicating. <br/>
<br/>
People are minimizing and discarding DWDM. I think that's a mistake. <br/>
<br/>
-- In the same way that many other posters in this thread think that taking DWM off the top rung of the design ladder is a mistake. <br/>
<br/>
I didn't return my cell phone upgrade because it didn't function as a phone. In fact, it was as serviceable as my prior (and still current) phone. I returned it because the camera irritated the hell out of me. The menu system irritated the hell out of me. I thought I could tolerate a flip phone, and I couldn't. I returned the phone because the DWDM stunk. <br/>
<br/>
The DWDM mattered so much that it devalued the phone-ness of the phone. <br/>
<br/>
And look at it further: am I going to consider a phone that's DWM only? Not on your life. <br/>
I need a contact/phone list in my phone. I can't be bothered to remember everyone's number these days, or keep a separate PDA/notebook for that information. I want Bluetooth to sync to my home machine, and IR to sync to my work machine. I want custom ringtones. I want a speakerphone. I want voice dialing. I want a candybar or slider design. <br/>
<br/>
I want these things. I will use them. DWDM IS important. It's important to the individual user, even if it isn't important to the basic product itself. And I design my games for the individuals playing them -- not for the sake of the game itself. <br/>
<br/>
I don't need to convince anyone here. (Run along little horsie, I'll stop beating you. . . .) :)  <br/>
<br/>
I think JoshuaBR came up with a fine thought. I think if I hold on to it, my designs will be much better than DWM-only designs. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I'm going through the RPGPundit's blog archive, and i came across a post that confronts DWDM from a different angle. He's a little abrasive, but try to look past that, if you can. <br/>

                            The cellphone analogy there is an example of how the phone manufacturer incorrectly guessed what mattered. That's all. The things you want are very, very common. They could have invested the effort to figure out what a particular segment of their market wanted and design that.

Rumble, I wasn't intending to be insulting or anything. I just want to know where you're coming from. Thank you for giving me the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend to you Dogs in the Vineyard and Prime Time Adventures. Dogs has a narrow thematic focus (though I don't think you'll have any trouble coming up with interesting things to do) and PTA has a broad one. Neither is stifling by any measure.<br/><br/>Brand, my questions above were non-rhetorical. I really want to understand what value the rules can have in a game with rules that Don't Matter. I'm asking you because we typically see eye-to-eye on these things.                        </div>

                            If they have an effect on the game that I care about, how can they have an effect that doesn't matter?<br/><br/>I'm not being deliberately obtuse. I think that the rules intensely inform what matters.<br/><br/>I haven't played a lot of D&amp;D, but I've played a bunch of times. Here's what I've noticed:<br/><br/>Defeating the big bad guy at the end is done through combat. There's usually a fight or two over the course of each session. In between fights, there are clues that have to be followed to get to the next fight. This happens no matter what the story's about because that's where all the rules lie.<br/><br/>I've played a lot of GURPS. Here's what I've noticed:<br/><br/>There are a number of conflicts over the course of the game. The players avoid situations that make their Disads relevant and push into situations that use their Ads.<br/><br/>In both games, players do things that they think is what the GM wants because <i>that's a rule</i>. It says so in the books: the GM's word is law, and so forth; that means that, surely as getting hit with a bullet decreases my Ht, contradicting the will of the GM will lose me resources. The game is designed so that's true.<br/><br/>Those are the things that matter when playing those games. The rules make them matter.                        </div>

                            Joshua: let's say your game includes the hugely extensive GURPS vehicle creation rules.  Do those rules drive the game to what matters?<br/>
<br/>
How about the pages and pages and pages of skills?  Long, detailed combat mechanics?  Lists of spells and psychic powers and super-abilities?<br/>
<br/>
You're right about ads and disads driving play.  It hasn't been my experience, but I won't argue that point.  Does the presence of one rule system in a game that points to what matters mean that the whole ruleset does?                        </div>

                            See, I think this comes down to my snappy little titles for the two categories, which are not, perhaps, the most precise labels in the world.<br/><br/>Alternating Current, when I say "Design What Matters" or "Design What Doesn't Matter" it's starting with a foundational assumption that there is a "Thing That Matters" to the game you're about to play.  The Thing That Matters may be the interaction of trust between strangers, the thrill of an escalating challenge, the perfect emulation of a prior experience, et cetera.<br/><br/>Design What Matters says that you should identify and hit that target with focused rules that guide the players to addressing the Thing That Matters.<br/><br/>Design What Doesnt' Matter says that the players are already going to address the Thing That Matters anyway, with or without your pervy mechanics.  What they need is rules and procedures that will take care of everything else.  It is most assuredly <em>not</em> saying that those rules don't matter, it's just that those rules aren't pushing the players to the Thing That Matters.  (See what I mean about my imprecise snappy titles?)<br/><br/>Fuel consumption, which is something that GURPS Vehicles can calculate, is probably never going to be the Thing That Matters, but it very well may matter to the course of the game, especially if the Thing That Matters is something like "can you shepherd your resources to defeat the challenge put forward by the GM?"<br/><br/>DWDM takes care of supporting details that are put together to create the Thing That Matters <em>without explicit rules for putting them together</em>.  DWM are explicit rules for directly addressing the Thing That Matters.<br/><br/>Is that any clearer?                        </div>

I haven't played with the GURPS vehicle rules personally, but I would think so.  Using them makes vehicles important and they guide how vehicles are built.  In literary terms, a vehicle is an externalization -- just like a costume or superpower -- but unlike those it is generally the property of the group rather than of an individual.  That makes it part of the group identity, which is much different than expressing an individual.  <br/><br/>As an example of this, you'll note that both <i>Firefly</i> and <i>Serenity</i> are named after the ship.  In production, there was enormous effort spent on the ship: both the interior sets and the external special effects.  The art of both of those is central to the narratives.  Change the ship and you'll change the show.  <br/><br/>More generally, you seem to be implying that rules-heavy means that the rules don't drive what matters.  I'd agree that an <i>individual</i> rule means less in a rules-heavy game.  So, for example, an individual skill or trait in <i>Burning Wheel</i> (from the pages and pages of lifepaths) means less than the magic score in <i>Trollbabe</i>.  But the principle remains the same.  <br/><br/>Lists of abilities certainly drive what matters, by setting limits and giving examples.  For example, I can take "I'm a good shot" as suggested in Dogs, and then take other traits based on how he learned to shoot.  Or I can take Guns skill in GURPS, and take other related skills to my defined background.  These are mechanically different, but they both drive what matters.                        </div>

So, i see all of those things as going to improve the function of phone, while all the truly extra stuff - cameras, mp3 players, pdas, etc - moves it towards performing a different function, and thus to incoherence.<br/><br/>Now that is all well and good - but i've been getting distracted by the analogy! Isn't there a warning somewhere to avoid that in discussions like this one? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I completely agree with the fineness of JoshuaBR's thought! <br/><br/><code>There isn't "a" style of play out there that only DWDM can do, but there are groups of players out there for whom DWDM products fit their needs.</code><br/><br/>But i want to point out that it is an unstable stituation - a situation that is the effect of previous developments, of learning experiences. <br/><br/>These people, unlike me, have already learned a way to play - and they are served quite well by good DWDM products - but they are the only ones who can teach others - novices like me - to play their games, to use their DWDM products. It a system of apprenticeship - like early universities and the trade guilds - a network of gamers teaching gamers how to game, down through the years and accross the planet. <br/><br/>This is all well and good - except, DWM games can teach themselves, can be designed to teach themselves, and, to truly be functional, they *must* teach themselves...<br/><br/>So if you already know how to play you don't really want a DWM game, a game that tells you how to play some completely other way; You just want a collection of bits and pieces that you can add on to what you already know, right?<br/><br/>But if you don't know how to play, you only have two options to get playing: The traditional approach of finding a group of veterans to apprentice with, or the new way of picking up a particular game that specifically tells you how to play it (and only it).<br/><br/>(Edited for grammer and spelling!)                        </div>

For the most part I agree, but I'd suggest that most imaginative people in the world "know how to play" in that sense without ever having played before -- we make stories all the time through our normal lives, and children spend massive amounts of time in make believe and let's pretend.  That can be brought forward and used as a framework to build play using DWDM tools -- the first couple sessions may be rough, but it will work out eventually.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty confident this is the case; this is how I got into roleplaying games.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure DWDM isn't a myth.  <br/><br/>See, the rules are what we play with, and I'm using "play" here in the sense of playing with toys or playing chess.  You're doing something, you're engaging in the mechanics.  If you're not, you're not playing the game; you're cooperatively storytelling, engaging in improvisational theater, something else that's not playing an RPG.  <br/><br/>You <b>can't</b> design for what doesn't matter, because in every design something <b>does</b> matter (System Does Matter, remember?), and someone will focus on that.  Which is why you get gunbunny Vampire players, versus those who want to have politics and angst and interaction, and why even having one of the one ruins it for a whole group of the other.  <br/><br/>All of the stuff that isn't mechanics, that supposedly "matters" in a DWDM game?  None of that stuff has any mechanical effect on the character, or on the game.  <br/><br/>In a DWM game, minmaxing your character (in other words, using the mechanics of the game to your and your character's best advantage -- maximizing your character's strengths and minimizing its weaknesses) is playing the game as God and the designer intended.  In a "DWDM" game, minmaxing your character is considered an abomination -- yet the people who do it end up enjoying the game more than the people who "are just here to roleplay".                        </div>

                            Perhaps better terms for DWM/DWDM could be "guided" and "unguided" designs? Or maybe "strong" and "weak" guidance. Both 'matter' in the "Design Does Matter" sense, but some strongly guide you towards a certain playstyle/objective such as "the interaction of trust between strangers, the thrill of an escalating challenge, the perfect emulation of a prior experience, et cetera." tMW, DiTV, MLwM would all fall here, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
Unguided (or weakly guided) rules provide a set of rules which don't guide the group towards any one playstyle/objective. The group provides it's own guidance towards those things, and would prefer it if the formal, shop-bought rules didn't get in the way of that. This is where your GURPS, The Pool, Burning Wheel, etc. would sit.<br/>
<br/>
PTA, I'm not sure. I'd think that it falls into the weak guidance category. You've got Issues and you create scenes which should have conflict in them, but I don't think it <i>strongly</i> guides you to make the conflicts about the Issues. (If you got some free Fan Mail or something whenever you started a conflict about your Issue, then I could see the guidance getting stronger.)                        </div>

As I understand what Chris is saying, is that the degree to which the Buffy RPG doesn't support Buffy-like play, it isn't good design.  I tend to agree with that even though I don't agree with his assessment.  <br/><br/>Personally, I've been playing a Buffy campaign for three years, and I think it supports Buffy-like play pretty well.  It has definite weaknesses, but is solid overall.  The combat system is simple but dramatic -- there is no no death spiral, and Drama Point spending is encouraged at the end of the fight rather than the start.  It's quick to resolve but still has flashy maneuvers.  There are problems with the system, though, so I can certainly understand criticisms.  <br/><br/>To the extent that it does not support Buffy-like play, I think those are valid criticisms of it.  You can't defend it by saying "It's Design What Doesn't Matter, so it's not supposed to support Buffy-like play."                        </div>

I don't want to break down in semantic games here, so I'll try to phrase it more completely.  <br/><br/>The Buffy game design shouldn't worry about people who simply don't want to play a Buffy-like game.  It's not the game's job to get you to play something you don't want to do.  However, assuming that you are on board with the premise, the game should guide you towards cool Buffy-like things.  For example, if fighting a combat to win, you shouldn't have to do un-Buffy-like things to beat your opponent.  The same applies to other fields of play.                        </div>

It seems that the example you give (having to do un-Buffy-like thinks to beat your opponent) is a good example of DWM, where WM isn't actually what you want to play, not of DDWM or DWDM (assuming there's a difference).                        </div>

                            Sempiternity raised the question of how people learn DWDM games without being apprenticed. On the one hand there's a very interesting hypothesis embedded there: it implies that up until the publication of DWM games all the roleplaying in the world could be traced back to a single group! While I don't believe that for a second, I'll bet there's a germ of truth to it and I'd be fascinated to see the social tree traced back for a bunch of different gamers.<br/><br/>But seriously, as JoshBR points out, people do figure out how to use DWDM games simply by plugging them into previous experiences and activities. Joshua points to storytelling, make believe, and pretend; I would point to related types of games and activities such as wargames, Choose Your Own Adventure books, and (later) various immersive or simulative computer/video games.<br/><br/>Yet another approach, I think, is the presentation of a "core story" or "basic scenario" that gets players into the game but doesn't limit their use of the system. This is the inside-out method of demonstrating to the players that they have a neat toy in front of them, but then challenging them to find new ways to use it. (Over on JoshBR's blog I connected this process to bricolage, but you can make what you will of that.)<br/><br/>And...it basically worked for me. Starting with white box D&amp;D you had the rudimentary objectives of "beat things, stay alive, and level up", then it expanded to place the dungeon in a rudimentary socioeconomic context (using money from dungeoneering to hire allies, upgrade equipment, and buy supplies) and from there interest expanded into creating more concrete, textured settings to contextualize the core mechanics of spells, combat, and character improvement--until at some point, the context began to overshadow the core mechanics.                        </div>

                            Is there a good example of a DWDM game we can all point to?  I'm still having all kinds of trouble with this concept.                        </div>

                            Danny, beware your terms. ;)  There are some DWDM books out there; the only place DWDM games can be found are when people sit down to play one.  But in answer to your question: Blue Rose, World of Darkness/Exalted, GURPS, and (by my gut) PTA and the Pool.                        </div>

                            First you need to figure out what matters. Then you locate a game that isn't designed for it. I think I'm being consistent with what I wrote over on Josh's blog when I say that if what matters is, for example, themes of friendship and betrayal, then GURPS is DWDM. GURPS <i>can</i> be used for a scenario where friendship and betrayal matter, but the rules in the game themselves offer very little that could be used to push those issues to the fore, or aid you in addressing them.<br/><br/>Then if you choose GURPS as your rules set, you're either not going to get themes of friendship and betrayal, or you're going to have to supply those themes yourself--perhaps by engineering the PC backgrounds and situation before starting play, perhaps by tacitly or overtly pushing play in that direction.<br/><br/>Part of the problem of identifying DWDM games is that it's partly a matter of perspective. If you're disinclined to think in terms of "what matters", the phenomenon may be invisible to you and you may instead tend to identify DWM games as overly-focused or pushy. Or if you strongly identify certain mechanical rewards as "the reason you play the game", then you're always going to see those rewards as "what matters".<br/><br/>E.g. in standard D&amp;D, it's pretty hard not to see killing monsters and taking their stuff as "what matters" because it's the primary method of gaining the most obvious mechanical reward: XP and leveling up. Furthermore those rewards then make you better at killing more monsters and taking their stuff.<br/><br/>But other games weaken or break this cycle--e.g., D&amp;D variants which give a standard XP reward per session. There's another phenomenon, which can appear in combination with the former, where the players simply don't connect their enjoyment or interest in the game to mechanical elements in such a way as to form a reward cycle. So if they're not particularly interested in combat, then (a) getting better at combat doesn't mean much to them and (b) even if the players want to get better at something, getting better via combat is uninteresting.<br/><br/>Going back to GURPS, the game actually has a fairly involved combat system, so if this system strongly engages the players' interest, there may be enough of a reward in fighting to overcome the fact that the mechanics of the game don't directly reward fighting by making you better at fighting. GURPS then looks like a DWM game even though it isn't any such thing for a group that uses it to play out complex social situations.                        </div>

Side comment: <br/><br/>Can we please not be terminology police for people using words in a clear and common way?  DannyK's use of the term "game" is common and well-understood.  I don't want people here to be chided for this -- it's exclusionary and confusing.  I'm fine with jargon, but not to the point that it prevents other people from using ordinary use of common words.                        </div>

                            Perhaps I wasn't clear, John.  I wasn't trying to talk down to anybody, just to point out that the question itself was problematic, or potentially so, and the answer I was giving had to be understood as book products that were designed rather than games that were played.<br/>
