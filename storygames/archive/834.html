                    An interesting <a href="http://hofrat.blogspot.com/2006/05/interview-mit-wolfgang-baur.html" rel="nofollow">interview with Wolfgang Baur</a>, wherein he details a "patron model" of publishing, which he is apparentely experimenting with for some module writing. <br/><br/><code>I set the lowest price at the cost of a module: $5. But that price buys you no influence on the design, just a copy when it is ready. It's for people who just want to treat the Open Design module like any other.<br/><br/>I wanted to make it possible for the bigger patrons to have more influence than that. So, for $10, anyone can help choose the level and (more importantly) the name/concept of the adventure. In addition, they see all the outlines and design steps behind the scenes as the project moves ahead.<br/><br/>The $20 and $50 levels are for people who want even more influence as the design continues. The $20 patrons choose monsters to go into the design. The $50 patrons do that and critique the draft text, and they are written into the dedication. These patrons even choose titles for the next project in the series. I still do the writing and design work, but they are directors or critics, so they shape the project as well. For people who want to see how design decisions happen, it's a great opportunity to visit behind the scenes.</code><br/><br/>His site is <a href="http://customadventure.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Very cool. It reminds me of....god...someone on the Forge who took submissions for a game idea, and he chose the best one and wrote it. I'm going to feel really stupid once someone reminds me who did this. <br/><br/>Anywayz, another way to move past the three-tier model. Neato. Anyone else know any other projects like this going on?                </div>

                            It's also interesting to note that Issaries has their fan association which at certain levels of membership buys you the right to see Greg Stafford's notes for product which probably will never be fully completed.  Fan support in such a fashion did allow them to print HeroQuest, so, it's not a completely bad idea, if you can muster support.                        </div>

                            Yes, I know the ransom model (hell, I contributed to the Meatbot Massacre ransom). Adam makes me feel stooopid, but thanks for the reminder! I didn't know that about Issaries. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's like the ransom model in that you have to have some amount of recognition/cred in order to get it off the ground. But it could work in reverse - I mean, what if someone came to you and said "I would pay you 50 bucks to write an adventure module on these parameters."?                        </div>

                            One or more people from the Forge have put "beta" versions of games up for sale on, say RPGNow. I think in some cases customers also got the final version as part of the deal, or maybe at a discount.<br/><br/>The customers are basically late-period playtesters. They're paying for the priveledge of seeing the game early and also for being able to give feedback and shape the project before it's done.                        </div>
