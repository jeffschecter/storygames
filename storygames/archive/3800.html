I've seen VERY few products that could be truly called "heartbreakers" (that is "remaking D&amp;D with a few houserules, but 1-2 interesting things, and then taking out a loan against one's house to sell it) since d20. Perhaps even just one.  I won't count "<b>IMAGINE RPG</b>" (I can't find the link to the website. Anyone?), which is probably the epitome of Fantasy Heartbreaker in the extent that it looks exactly like AD&amp;D with like 3 houserules, and an interesting armor mechanic.<br/><br/>Since d20, I can only guess that the reason we haven't seen as many heartbreakers is that now people had the tools to create their own d20/D&amp;D mods and sell them, something they couldn't do under the days of "T$R" (and its aggressive stance against people posting houserules on the internet).<br/><br/>I haven't seen a Fantasy Heartbreaker, something that didn't say "d20" or "OGL" on it and yet tried to mimic D&amp;D, since.  There's been a few generic fantasy games (Epic RPG, others) but each of those were unique enough that they were not really at all like D&amp;D rulewise.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>Do people now just release a D20 game with their house rules inserted and the rest just says "See page XX of the PHB"?</blockquote>\nYep. And they're not taking out loans against their house to do so. This is an awesome thing.\n<blockquote>Is there a new class of D20 heartbreaker, or does the fact that these games really<b>are</b>just attempts to mould D&amp;D into something the author thinks is better than vanilla D&amp;D take them out of the heartbreaker category altogether?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely not. It's the creation of supplements for one system. There is no breaking of hearts, no "recreating the system from the ground up to sell as one's own without knowing what else is out there". It's utilizing an existing, strong system, plus one's creativity, to make supplements for an existing game.  <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85283/#Comment_85283" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T08:06:11+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  8:06AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember Imagine.

Here's a <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/FantasyHeartbreaker" rel="nofollow"><b>short definiton of fantasy heartbreaker</b></a> on the TheoryTopics wiki, which includes Ron's new list.  I haven't played any of that list, but from the reviews, it doesn't seem like the systems are much like D&amp;D at all -- except in the sense that most RPGs are like D&amp;D.  However, they were in the same genre as D&amp;D.  Games from the last few years that may or may not be heartbreakers depending on your view of the term: <br/><br/>"Adventures in Delving" ; "Castles &amp; Crusades" ; "The Chronicles of Ramlar" ; "Fantasy Imperium" ; "Forward... to Adventure!" ; "Hexicon Fantasy Roleplay" ; "Legends of Kralis" ; "Realms of Wor" ; "The Secret of Zir'An".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85449/#Comment_85449" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T18:23:23+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  6:23PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG.
