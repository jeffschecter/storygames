                    This is a new thread started out of the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=479&amp;page=1#Item_97" rel="nofollow">Playing Across Gender Lines</a> thread.  <br/><br/>I've tried many times to play passive characters and none have ever seemed fulfilling.  Sometimes, people I've played with for long periods of time have asked me if I was 'okay'.  "You're not doing anything.  Are you alright?  Do you feel well?"  I've seen many other players at the same tables as I have sat at, play a passive character and then upon reflection after the game, most (if not all) have talked about how they disliked their characters in one way or another.<br/><br/>I begin to wonder... is it that passive characters are counter productive in role playing games?  As I see it, the whole point in playing a PC in a game is to do things.  Things maybe you can't do in real life.  Things you've always wanted to do.  Etc., etc. <br/><br/>Some people have told me that I have a 'strong personality'.  Could that be part of it?  I'm not normally passive in my real life thus it's hard for me to play one?  Yet I have no troubles playing a man, a child, a senior citizen, an elf, and orc, or what have.  (These are all things I'm not as well.)<br/><br/>Am I wrong?  Am I missing something?  Any thoughts?<br/><br/>Lisa P                </div>

<br/>
Good questions. <br/>
<br/>
Answer 1.  I felt I was not.<br/>
<br/>
Answer 2.  I was unsure if I was or was not.  I'd ask my fellow gamers and most just wondered if I was okay.  Please note:  The last time I attempted such passive pc's I was playing Mage and D&amp;D.  Since I have gotten into the dirty hippie indie games, I have not done so as most are driven by player interaction/addition/driving the story/etc.<br/>

                            The problem is that many players only contribute, what their characters do or say. Of course, if the characters do not do or say very much there is hardly any contribution. <br/>
<br/>
And since the other players can not read minds (usually, that is) they cannot see that this lack of contribution is in fact due to the character and not OOC problems.<br/>
<br/>
One solution is to contribute, what the character thinks as well. This is not only helpful with passive characters but a good idea most of the time.                        </div>

                            Good answers, Lisa, thanks for responding so fast.<br/>
<br/>
Two more questions:<br/>
<br/>
3. Did you like the games?<br/>
<br/>
Which leads us directly to...<br/>
<br/>
4. How much of your character's inaction was just -how you thought they would react- and how much was -Lisa doesn't give a shit what is going on at the table-?<br/>
<br/>
AP Example from my experience:<br/>
<br/>
One of the players at my table was playing a character who was very laid back and he went along with what was happening but wasn't driving out on his own.  I asked him about it and he replied, "I'm a political activist in my day to day life, when I game in this campaign, I just want to relax and hit things a bit."<br/>
<br/>
I backed off and he seemed to have fun but I dunno if I would dig that so much in the games I play now.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
More in a bit.                        </div>

<p>I think it's hard to play a passive PC, because while you can have a passive protagonist, in a game your experiences are defined by what you're putting into the play. If you passivity is manifested as nothing happening (or indeed, if activity is manifest by changing nothing) there's nothing there to experience or enjoy. If passivity is manifested as more subtle actions, or explicitly making a show of buckling to or folding to potential activity, or by showing your steadfast willingness to stay passive in spite of large changes, then there's something interesting to see.</p>
<p>I think I had this with a player in my Dogs game, although I <em>think</em> it went well. Her player had to make a very difficult and traumatic choice early on, and later player her character as largely shell-shocked and quiet; she had her own concept of how she wanted to take her character, and it was this. I'm not sure if she herself felt engaged during this time (I was concerned at times) but this recently resolved as her character more or less "broke", nearly screaming her aggravation and disillusionment and making a shocking choice*. So, in this case: I'm not sure if her passivity was well done, or simply gave her the space to push her character where she wanted.</p>

                            From a GM's point of view it can be a problem because it is the GM duty to draw the character into the game, and if there are a player that don't participate active in the game, it can be very frustrating.<br/><br/>But if the player tell the GM that his character is passive, so the GM don't waste too much time to 'activate' the character, I don't think it is a big problem.<br/><br/>Personally I would never play a passive character, but I am a very passive person in real life, so there may be a connection there.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>

                            Conflict = Character + Desire + Obstacle<br/><br/>One kind of passive is lack of character goals and desires.  If this is the case, no conflict ever 'sticks' to this character, and they are, in very real terms, not doing anything significant.<br/><br/>Another kind of passive is a lack of character initiative, where they do nothing to overcome the obstacles that separate them from their desires.

                            Doh.  My post got eatten.<br/>
<br/>
Okies, let me try to remember exactly what I was saying...<br/>
<br/>
Judd,<br/>
<br/>
No I did not enjoy the games.  And I can say most of it was how I felt that the character would act.  I do remember on one occasion that I piped up with some ideas and was told by the GM, it was not in my PC's nature and the idea was shut down.  But most times, I felt it just wasn't in the character's nature and I didn't move on it.  Even though I did want to.<br/>
<br/>
Other times, like I mentioned originally, the party members would begin to turn to me for ideas.  When I would stay back and be passive, they would begin to press me (for a long time I was always assumed to be 'party leader') and sooner or later, the story/campaign would falter and I would have to pipe up and no longer play the PC as passive to keep the game moving.  More than once I was thanked by a GM for that.  <br/>
<br/>
But like I said, that was in my White Wolf and D&amp;D days.  With the indie games, I find it extremely hard to even envision passive characters.  I had thought I had one in mind earlier today, but truthfully, I didn't.<br/>

                            Passive characters would drive me kinda nuts now.  It would feel like they weren't giving to the table and I think that would cause other players not to give as much, put themselves into it and put shit right out there.<br/>

                            There is also a big difference between playing passively and playing a passive character. A passive character can be a really interesting thing to toy with, especially when the character is the PCof an active <i>player</i> that is helping to push or pull the game and the other characters into making life difficult for the passive PC. Few characters remain passive in ongoing turmoil and still survive, or at least survive in play. Where those boundaries are, how they are met and surpassed, and the cause for the passivity in the first place can all be dynamic locuses of conflict and play despite the character's passivity.<br/><br/>However, a passive player playing a passive character may just not be contributing anything to the story, or dynamic of the game..                        </div>

I never thought of it that way...  I always just ended up avoiding the conflicts.  I guess in that sense, I became passive as well.  Not just the PC.  <br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

                            What Mo says totally resonates with me. In our PTA game, Joe's character is extremely passive - a 'normal guy' by all accounts. However, he uses director stance to push this in interesting ways - introducing an in-the-closet sexuality, and more recently supercharging a fairly unexceptional childhood action (in the context of the game, anyway: obeying the commands of their cult leader to lead misbehaving children to confinement) by stating that one of its outcomes was the death of a PC's family. His character has spent several scenes trying to wriggle out of them, but Joe keeps thrusting him back in.                        </div>

                            Thanks Mo, that's exactly where I was going to go with this.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a regular habit during our WoD days to conflate player and character.  It's an old story and a bad habit, but essentially, it was considered RightGoodPlay to act like your character.  So, passive character = passive player.  <br/>
<br/>
Lisa and I are still kicking those habits.  I think this is just one of those.  More indie gaming will almost certainly make good medicine for this ailment.<br/>

                            Yeah, when playing a passive character, you have to really emphasize whatever contribution you are making. My group loves hearing internal monologues and detailed descriptions of what other PCs are doing (or in your case, not doing), so that can be done. Some games are really good at emphasizing this, some not so good. Some GMs, myself included, can get sloppy even when the game is good at emphasizing it. For example, MURPG is a game organized into Panels (turns), everyone gets the same number of Panels. It makes it pretty easy for a passive character to be actively played, you will get the same amount of chances to do (or emote, or whatnot) things that everyone else does. However, a group can still neuter this rule by saying "What are you, the character, doing? Nothing? Okay, next person..." instead of remembering, oh yeah, the real question is "What are you, the player, contributing to the game this time around the table?"                        </div>

                            JD,<br/><br/>I's gots to play MURPG with you some day. I so wanted to be able to make that game work, and was so unable to. I must learn from you. <br/><br/>Also, what JD and Mo said. I've been watching Six Feet Under recently and I so want to play a version of David as my next PTA character. Never has the process of not coming out been so gut churning.                        </div>

                            Another note:<br/>
<br/>
Players can support passive character play by emphasizing active narration over body language for the character. He might not be saying things or doing things that seem like actions, but he's saying things and doing things just by being.<br/>
<br/>
In Brand's Truth &amp; Justice campaign, we block and describe the game as if it were a graphic novel (Most similar to Astro City). It rocks, a lot. Some of the most poignant panels have involved involve no PC or NPC initiated action, but a broken down description of the body language involved.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, I should log off now, as we're overdue to start playing.. woohoo! game time!                        </div>
