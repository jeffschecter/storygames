                    Summer's over and it went by without enough gaming on my end.  I gamed a bit but nothing regular as I would like.<br/><br/>Anyway, this thread is about the moments that stand out to ya.<br/><br/>I really liked Brennan's GMing in Flaming Taft!, Mortal Coil at Gen Con this year.  He pushed the conflict just enough to be a real bastard but let us do some grave digging all our own.  It was solid stuff and neat to watch.  This is not even to speak of the belly laughter that was all ove that game.<br/><br/>I played in two one-shots that really blew my mind, one Lacuna that I ran and one DRYH run by my buddy, Jim.  Both games had legs and both had systems that just made me sit up and take notice.  We were ready to keep on keepin' on with both games but had agreed to a summer of one-shots.  So, on we went.<br/><br/>And in the beginning of the summer we finished up the first chapter of our monthyl Changeling inspired 1st Quest game.  We played outside, on a picnic table on Jeff's family's property, well away from any worldly distractions.  The game was solid but more than that it was just a pleasant day of gaming in the shade of the trees, eating good food and being among great friends.<br/><br/>And now leaves are beginning to fall and its time for some Cold City...<br/><br/>Tell me about your summer gaming.                </div>

                            Weapons of the Gods Campaign:  really nifty kung-fu duels, as you'd expect, but mostly the Great Game giving a graceful way for the characters to really affect the setting with their abilities while in the midst of conflict.  So the thing that's really standing out to me now is that everyone in China knows a painting wedding scene where everyone is wearing purple is a scene from the legendary "Jiankang Wedding", which the players made the most epic wedding of all time.<br/>
<br/>
Firefly short campaign:  Great characters from great players, introduced a new person to gaming, lots of fun.  But damn, playing a PTA/Unisystem frankenstein game makes me really want to play straight PTA.  Unisystem makes me sad.<br/>
<br/>
Eberron One-Shot:  I ran this one just before leaving for GenCon, which really kicked my trip off on a great note.  PCs had to protect a train from five simultaneous robberies, lots of fun.  I stole the "action zone" idea to make skills more relevant to the literally railroaded game - players could gamble action points on skill rolls to model things like fighting on top of the train, switching tracks before the train went off into the Mournland, leaping over dinner carts etc.  Worked OK with fixed stunts, worked much better when I decided (pretty much as soon as the dice rolled) that was stupid and let the players describe what they were doing however they liked.<br/>
<br/>
D&amp;D Campaign:  Some angst (the GM has a grand story she's running, and there's different levels of buy-in for it in the group, particularly me), but great group, and high-level D&amp;D for an arcane spellcaster is a playground of transhuman wonder.  To my 20th level sorceress, distance is a factor of knowledge, not space, which is a kind of fun I didn't expect from D&amp;D.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs:  Not a perfect match for our group (our group doesn't always want to walk head-on into a conflict the way Dogs seems to want), but we had a great time, and it was an excuse to fire up a Johnny Cash/Nick Cave soundtrack.<br/>
<br/>
GenCon:  Shooting the Moon Stalingrad, On the Eve of Apocalypse PTA, winning the Exalted Tourney and playing all those awesome demos.  Wonderful stuff, though I wish the Exalted game had have been better - it didn't tremble with the glory of the God-Kings we were playing and fighting, which was sad because it had six hours to do that, whereas Mu only had fifteen minutes and nailed it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  How could I forget nWoD Mage + kickers in LA with Ian Noble's crew?  Best example of the White-Wolf prelude I've ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, in New York, I hit Dro in the face with a Jungle Speed totem, and then we all went out for midnight Snakes on a Plane.  Life was good.                        </div>

                            My highlight of this Summer was our most recent Burning Wheel campaign (<a href="http://www.nwarpg.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=630" rel="nofollow">Actual Play thread at our local RPG forum</a>) wherein my group REALLY finally started to "get it" with regards to Beliefs. It was also a bit of a surprise because the guy who GMed it hadn't GMed in that group before, but turned out to be a REALLY good GM for a more story-driven game.<br/><br/>Now we're moving on to Dogs in the Vineyard, and his PLAYING has DEFINITELY improved as a result of GMing that short BW campaign, too. Nice.<br/><br/>I didn't get in enough gaming at GenCon this year (which will definitely be rectified NEXT year), but I played in a really educational session of --- wait for it! --- Burning Wheel run by Luke (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21090.0" rel="nofollow">my Actual Play post from the Forge</a>) and including some other people who hang out here (hey, Rafial and Buzz!). <br/><br/>The other great thing to come out of this Summer was that I started working on my game again with some real drive and determination to see it finished by GenCon '07.<br/><br/>Steven                        </div>

                            I've had near on to fuck all in terms of summer gaming.  I'm not only annoyed about it, I'm coming screaming out of the gate to try to fix it.<br/><br/>Crammed into the last few weeks has been a pair of Dogs sessions, a second full session of DRYH (I'm a player, not a GM! And it's awesome! And I crashed!), and a me-GMing spot of Agon.  There've been some vague intentions to have the once-a-month-at-best Exalted game goin' on locally, but half the weekends it ends up happening I'm already scheduled.<br/><br/>I'm damn well gonna run me some Mu once I can get past the reverse engineer challenge and putting Spirit of the Century out on the market.                        </div>

                            Only really one game this summer - the Exalted game I'm playing in. Which is nice, since it means I finally get to play, but I do wish I were running a game as well.<br/><br/>Lots of stunting fun - lots - and the entertainment factor of playing an inventive character much more impulsive than I am, and not as bright.                        </div>

                            I don't know if I can even remember all the shit I played this summer.  Seriously, the LAGames playtest circle has been the best gaming experience I have ever had.  Weekly play of <em>something</em> without getting bogged down in interminable campaigns that go stale.  Beautiful stuff.<br/><br/>So I've played:<br/><br/><strong>Repertoire</strong>, three playtests of a design that gets tightened up and developed each time, and is shaping up into a <em>fantastic</em> game.  Our troupes of actors roving from enclave to enclave have been huge on color, strong on conflict, ceaseless in backbiting.  The post-apocalyptic worlds have been beautiful, quirky things created from madcap fevered creativity.  Love this game.<br/><br/><strong>Joy Division</strong>, Mark's entry for that two-page game design thing.  Folks, seriously, go download it from 1km1kt or whatever it's called cause this game is <em>smokin</em> awesome.  Lets you play Men In Black trying to forestall the singularity of technology and social development that will destroy the human race, with a die system that will not quit.  Super fucking awesome.<br/><br/><strong>The Shadow of Yesterday</strong>, played in the outskirts of Near, with a pair of very different goblins and a couple of humans who, it was my impression, really didn't know what to do with the goblins.  I really didn't 'get' the game in the first session, but I'm looking forward to giving it  a crack next time with a little more understanding of how things are supposed to go.<br/><br/><strong>Dogs</strong>, me running and Judson and Jeff playing.  Playing through a town that I'd run before and watching it turn out <em>totally different</em>, complete with a meddling ex-Dog and an entire game where guns didn't even come out, let alone get fired.  Also played Dogs earlier at Gamex, and this game is just simply a joy to introduce new folks to the indie catalog of games.  Running it again this weekend.<br/><br/><strong>Heads of State: 9 short games about tyrants</strong>, which we finally finished playtesting the last couple games this summer.  Being that it's Mark's design, it's a big quirky machine that churns out quirky situations and characters, but despite all that it produced some pretty interesting results, especially in terms of the dictator that we ended up playing around the most.  Cubism + PoliSci + RPGs... who would have thought that equation equaled Awesome?<br/><br/><strong>Full Light, Full Steam</strong> playtests of many stripes, watching the final bits and pieces of the system fall into place, seeing where the text needs some smoothing over and where entire sections should just be cut out and left behind.  The total glee in watching players take my baby and run off in new directions that I would have never thought of -- playing naval intelligence spies!  Doing an upstairs/downstairs with the officers and enlisted men!  Great stuff!<br/><br/><strong>Cage of Reason</strong> in a hotel room with Jason and Mark and Judson, 'just cause' Jason was in town.  Philosophers throwing down in cage-match wrestling style.  Bizzare and funny.<br/><br/><strong>Nine Worlds</strong> at Gamex, wonderful, beatiful game that I desperately want to play again, but there's so many other games piling up in the hopper.  The same basic situation, played by two different groups, came out in one as a soap opera and in ours as a paranoia-filled crucible as everyone was spying on everyone else.<br/><br/><strong>Roach</strong> at Gamex, a little claustrophobic with only four players, but enough of a taste that I am <em>so there</em> when it runs this weekend.  Our Regina Sutton actually survived, relatively unmarred, much as Jesse tried to kill her.<br/><br/><strong>Primetime Adventures</strong>, also at Gamex.  I was a little skeptical of the groupmindshare stories that I'd heard about the game, but in the end they're all true.  Our series, set in a mental institution where <em>something</em> is threading the patients' delusions together, was fantastic, and in the space of four or five hours we managed to squeeze off a pitch, a pilot, and an episode in the middle of the series.  I am so running this game again this weekend.<br/><br/>Man, now I'm all stoked for this weekend.                        </div>

                            I really didn't get a lot of gaming in at all, but (a) it was all enjoyable and fun and (b) it's still a damn sight better than I did in the full year previous.  I'm working on making sure the upward trend continues.<br/><br/>What I did:<br/> - Played a couple sessions of DitV on the Foundry -- which was fun both for the game, the story, the GM and the medium.<br/> - Ran (and am running) a playtest run of Galactic.  Love it.  Good stuff.  Wish I could make it weekly.<br/> - Played a really fun paranoia one-shot in NYC.  Wrote about it here and on my blog. Good good stuff.<br/><br/>What I'm planning:<br/> - I posted on my blog about wanting to get and run Bacchanal, but not knowing who with, and two of my players were like "Dude, that looks TASTY."<br/> - More Galactic playtesting<br/> - High-power, wire-fu, TSoY riff on Wells of Souls <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> - Mortal Coil, very very definitely.<br/> - I wanna run some DitV, finally, but I've got one enthusiastic and two 'yeahsurefine' players for it... :P  Might be able to get some Princes' Kingdom in, instead.<br/> - Definitely running the Roach. Only question is when.<br/> - Totally running Best Friends the next time I'm in NYC.<br/><br/>Waiting in the Wings and/or on order:<br/> - Mountain Witch, DRYH, WGP, Agon, Hero's Banner, 1001 Nights, Mechaton<br/><br/>... and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.                        </div>

                            This was a good gaming summer, made ultra kickass awesome by the GenCon cherry on top.<br/><br/><b>Nine Worlds</b><br/>I ran a 4-session series for two non-gamer friends. They played brand-spankin-new archons who were adjusting to new lives in the big ol' solar system. It was great fun, but man... we seriously hit a creative wall at session four. We were pouring so much <i>care</i> into the game, it was tiring. I can't wait to do more 9W, though. It's an amazing and cool game.<br/><br/><b>Agon</b><br/>Lots and lots of playtesting, then 20 demos at GenCon! I've also played twice since I got back. I think it's time to take a little break from my own game before I burn out on it.<br/><br/><b>TSOY: Tales from the Aether</b><br/>Our regular weekly game group is totally hooked on TSOY. It's the coolest thing ever, in case you haven't heard. We're playing this crazy pulp-space-fantasy thing with aetherships and man-bats and sky pirates. It's awesome. I ran the first season (6 sessions). Tony is running season two now, which has another 3 sessions to go. There's some AP if you want it: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20751.0" rel="nofollow">One</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21155.0" rel="nofollow">Two</a>.<br/><br/>At GenCon, I played <b>1001 Nights</b>, <b>Hero's Banner</b>, <b>Capes</b>, <b>It Was A Mutual Decision</b>, <b>Shooting the Moon</b>, and <b>Galactic</b>. How's that for a line-up of gaming hotness?<br/><br/>I am so excited about what's coming next. On deck now:<br/><b>Burning Empires</b><br/><b>Primetime Adventures</b><br/><b>Don't Rest Your Head</b><br/><b>Princes' Kingdom</b><br/>More <b>Nine Worlds</b><br/><br/>Plus more <b>Galactic</b> via Skype. When will I find time for Cold City, Contenders, Shock:, Carry, Verge, Best Friends, The Roach, Dictionary of Mu, and Mortal Coil? This next gaming year is gonna be packed.                        </div>

                            This has been an almost gaming-less summer for me, the first in quite a while. Played a few sessions of my partner's semi-improvised RPG with our 7-year-old, tried to recruit for 4 different games and couldn't get a quorum for any of them. My social circles are pretty much-gamer-barren these days unless I radically re-adjust my tastes, and recruiting spanking new ones hasn't been a priority.<br/><br/>It's been very frustrating. When I have managed to play, I'm having some of the best play of my life. It's just that I lack gamers who I can agree with about interests or schedule.<br/><br/>Eventually the tide will turn again.                        </div>

                            Wow, it's been an exciting summer.<br/><br/>Despite Artesia being snubbed at nearly every convention I tried to run it at (okay, so snubbed is a bit strong) every session was packed at Origins and Mark won the best RPG spot.  Hanging with Brennan, Mendel, Kat and Mr. Miller and a fun dinner with Clinton, Mike Holmes (too many Mikes) and a host of others was a blast.<br/><br/>DexCon was eye opening and a lot of fun.  We only went for a day trip but I was overwhelmed with the awesomeness.  It has ben far too long that I have gone to a con and have been truly torn about what games to play.  I got a taste of Mu, run by the man himself.  Brennan ran a game of Mortal Coil with Fred that really helped me put certain things into perspective.  Besides, we faced Baba Yaga!  I finally played Inheritance - BW con games are always a blast!  Again, it was hanging with people I really like that makes it all worthwhile even if cool gaming hadn't happened.<br/><br/>At home Russ has been laboring through a Mage campaign.  I am so glad the season opened with my own Game Day in April if for no other reason than I found my current gaming group.  We've had a lot of fun with Mage, Octane, Lacuna, Dogs, and Mortal Coil.  Next up - <b><i>With Great Pirates!</i></b><br/><br/>I ran several games of Mortal Coil which has to get MVP for me due to it's legs.  We just started a MC game where we are demigods of Krynn (Dragonlance) kicked out to go find our own worlds to rule and watch over.<br/><br/>This weekend we head off to a weekend long Pirate larp in the mountains of PA.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of games this summer and met some great folk.<br/><br/>What I look forward to is a very Burning Winter to keep me warm.  I am planning on revitalizing my BW western game.  I am planning on finishing my Artesia &lt;-&gt; BW conversion tool and I will be running no less than two <i>Burning Empires</i> campaigns!<br/><br/>Finally I will announce my newest endevour.  January is officially declared <b>30 Days of gaming!</b>  You heard that right.  me and four of my peeps are going to play through a BE campaign from January 2nd to January 31st.  It will be broken up by some one shots and boardgames and our meetings will be online once a week but I am determined to get it done!<br/><br/>Anyone interested in joining me please email me at eruditus dot don at gmail dot com, either with your own group or if you live anywhere near Philly I could use a few more peeps.  <br/><br/>For once in my life I am looking forward to the winter (I would normally rather be hybernating <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Lots of great gaming for me this summer.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel. A ton. Both my regular Monday night group, in which we've been playing a game inspired by some D&amp;D modules, and my Saturday or Sunday group, which has been playing some intense dark ages of Earthsea stuff. Old-Skool.<br/><br/>Burning Empires. Late spring, but close enough. Exhilarating and Exhausting.<br/><br/>HeroQuest. Late spring, but close enough. Classic young Heortling men, whose fathers were killed or exiled in the rebellion, coming of age and seeking to deal with the realities of being an occupied people who are changing due to the influx of new ideas. Enjoyable.<br/><br/>Conspiracy of Shadows. One session. We played blood opera and things got...weird. Bloody.<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures. We played drug-addicted undercover cops in a world where demons were rampant. Brutal.<br/><br/>Lacuna, 2nd Attempt. We went to Blue City. I turned into Popeye Doyle. Surreal.<br/><br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5. We attempted to play through the Forge of Fury without drifting any rules. Illuminating.<br/><br/>Donjon. Some Black Company-inspired action. I played a really nasty witch doctor. Interesting.<br/><br/>Agon. Only one session. Dave Turner let us fight a hydra. Drifty.<br/><br/>My Life with Master. One session, with Michael Miller as the Master. We created magnificent pearls by draining away the beautiful qualities of people. Tragic.<br/><br/>Shock: One session so far. People are plugged in to the Global Distributed MindNet to provide processing resources. Our praxes are Acquiesence vs. Denial and Sex vs. Violence. Engaging.<br/><br/>Nine Worlds. Only character creation and campaign setup so far. Lost Armada privateers are going to take on Atlantean pirates in a quest for the Celestial Compass in an adventure on the high aetherical seas. Salivating.<br/><br/>Up next:<br/>More Nine Worlds.<br/>Rune (followed by Agon?)<br/>Sorcerer (probably with Dictionary of Mu)                        </div>

<p>We're wrapping up our <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> 6-town parade of misery tonight! Would someone shoot my Dog already? Jebus. The kid needs to be put down!</p>
<p>It looks like there's gonna be some <em>Agon</em> tomorrow night. I'm eager.</p>
<p>I'm hoping for some long-form <em>Shock:</em> starting next week or so.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, the steadily immortalized Flaming Taft! game of <em>Mortal Coil</em> and <em>Cold City</em> games at GenCon.</p>
<p>Other than that, I've had two bat mitvahs and three weddings, one of them mine, to absorb all my mind this summer.</p>
