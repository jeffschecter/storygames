I say what I've got done and what I plan to do. Really keeps me moving.) anyway Boco thought the players didn't have any real decision making because the design was just like the card game war. Looking At it I thought he was right. So... Came up with a new design. Pleas check it out and tell me what you think.<br/><br/>The design goal is to make an ultra fast card combat game, where players slam down cards with combat descriptions on then, followed by the other player slamming down a defense. Then more cards are slammed down in rapid succession. the words on the cards narrate the action. Action is a lot of attacks and defenses like in. Kung fu movie. After a few rounds the combat ends and you go back to the higher level story action.<br/><br/>Okay, so that's the goal. But players need to have at tactical decisions that are meaningful. Here is what I've come up with.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of cards that have attacks and defenses. Each type of card has a rock paper scissors symbol on it that corresponds to strong moves, yielding moves, and steady moves. Strong beats steady, steady beats yielding, yielding beats strong. Player have three to five cards in their hand (better fighters have more cards). The attacker throws down an attack card. It is a strong stead or yielding attack. If the defender doesn't have a defense card they take the hit and if it was a strong attack, lose the fight immediately. If the defender throws down a defense card they can either block the hit (if they play the same type of card strong vs strong for instance), turn the attack around on the attacker and hurt them (if they have the card type, I guess I could call it a suit, that defeats the other type. Yielding defeats strong - judo flip!) or take a wound even through the defense if the suit played is defeated by the attackers suit (so a strong attacks blows through a steady defense). The winner of the attack gets to make the next attack. If the blow is just blocked, the attacker retains initiative.<br/><br/>So the player has to decide, do I think they have no defense? If so strong attack if you can. But they know you will want to do that so they will use a yielding defense. So you want to use a steady attack instead. Player psychology will fit into this because aggressive not so bright players will always go strong and lose a lot. <br/><br/>This system would still meet the design criteria of being fast and furious and create a fight narrative while also giving some meaningful tactical decision making. I'm imagining playing a fight sequence with a female player who doesn't like complex number crunching combat games. This is fast and easy. It would then let play get back to what I think is the more interesting bits - emotional interaction.<br/><br/>So... What do you think?<br/><br/>In know the rock paper scissors thing is not new but it looks like it will work here. And I can see making lots of different decks of action cards based on the words strong, steady, yielding to describe many different kinds of fighting styles. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421736/#Comment_421736" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-21T15:41:55+00:00" title="September 21, 2013  3:41PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2013 3:42PM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because you're designing more for a <i>feel</i> - "more cards are slammed down in rapid succession" - than a mechanic, it's hard to say if it's good or bad. That's a knowledge that will reveal itself during playtest. I just wonder if it's so smart to mix tactical mechanics with narrative because they usually don't mix well. We all know how well that works in <b>Mouse Guard</b> where description is so chopped up by the mechanics that it's impossible to get a flow. "So the player has to decide, do I think they have no defense?" contradicts your design goal. I don't even know if your mechanics are going to be fast if you got several cards to choose from AND must include them into your description. It feels like to much thinking (for my taste) when it comes to rapid descriptions in a tennis matter.<br/><br/>I also wonder how this works outside duels. Are we talking about five players and one game master where the latter must follow up all the players' descriptions? I played a game where the game master described every second action. That system had a tendency to burn out the game  master's brain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421744/#Comment_421744" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-21T19:31:27+00:00" title="September 21, 2013  7:31PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the idea before it is even half baked. More like note jotted on a page really so it could fall apart completely on Playtest.<br/><br/>Thinking of it as a fight between two players rather than a fight of many players. The notion is that there is a terrain board with miniatures moving around. The story part of the game is done with a different deck of action cards. I've described the method in Fairy Tale Assassin League threads. Combat should only be triggered when a player says it happens in the story part of the game. The combat cards are to be a quick way of resolving those fights. <br/><br/>I hadn't thought of five player battles. In a story game it will be inevitable that many people will be a are a fight. I need to figure out how that will work. <br/><br/>This is why asking for feedback is so useful.

If you used the symbols to have players chaining moves <i>off of each other</i>. Each card has maybe two symbols on it, at the top of the card, and it also has "triggers" corresponding to some of the symbols. Each trigger lists an effect that you get if you can spot that symbol on the card that was just played.<br/><br/>Player 1 would play a card, and it has two symbols at its top. Player 2 then plays a card against it, and one of the symbols on Player 1's card triggers an ability on Player 2's card. Player 2's card <b>also</b> has two symbols on it, of course, and Player 1 hits back with a card that has a trigger for <i>each</i> of Player 2's symbols.<br/><br/>So with every card you play, you make an attack but also give your opponent an opportunity, if they have the proper cards to capitalize on that opportunity. It works great if you use symbols to represent 3-4 different "stance" elements. A card would represent one of your moves, and the two symbols at the top of the card represent the change in stance that the move requires. The triggers on the card would represent how your move is able to take advantage of your opponent's stance.<br/><br/>Note--I didn't say that cards were divided into Attacks/Defenses. That's because I see it as something more free-flowing. Some cards will give you benefits that are more defensive than others, but in a fight, you're always moving and always somewhere in between attack and defense. It's the flow that matters. And obviously, you could correlate certain symbols/stance elements with being more aggressive or defensive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421755/#Comment_421755" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T02:35:06+00:00" title="September 22, 2013  2:35AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2013 2:35AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You know what would be really cool?

It worked fine. It was quick, easy, kind of fun, and with some meaningful tactical decisions, and created a description of the fight. I say description rather than narrative because the players did not say what happened, it was descriptive words on the cards that made the description.<br/><br/>We did a fight between a pulp hero (who got five cards in his hand) and a bunch of mooks (who got three cards). <br/><br/>The basics of the rules are that one player is the attacker (in this case the mooks). They throw down an attack card. The defender throws down a defense card. Depending on the suit of the the attack and defense different outcomes happen. Each suit has another suit that it trumps. So if an attack suit trumps a defense suit then the attack breaks through. If a defense trumps and attack, the attack is turned back on the attacker who gets hit and looses initiative. If the suits are the same the attack is just blocked. If a player can't defend against a rock/strong attack they lose the fight immediately. If you don't have a defense you just get hit and if you are the attacker and have no attack then both sides get to discard any number of cards and draw new ones. If a hit goes through the player doesn't draw a replacement card for the card they lost. Reach zero cards and you lose the fight.<br/><br/>As the mooks I had only one attack card - a strong attack - so that's what I played. Had I had other options I'd likely have still played this because of the off hand chance that the defender had no defense cards. I could win the fight in a single blow. Of course he had five cards so that didn't happen. We kept on exchanging blows with him turning attacks back on me to take the initiative and me turning some attacks back on him, but having fewer cards meant my range of choices soon narrowed down to the point of my defense of attack being purely random luck of the draw. Needless to say I lost - just as the mooks are supposed to!<br/><br/>The descriptive words on the cards were meaningless to the mechanics of the fight but if we'd been using miniatures, then the descriptions would have had our figures moving around slightly. I think this will be fun in a miniature wargame as small tactical moves turn flanks and exploit holes in lines. <br/><br/>It is worth moving onto a full deck to use in some wargame play tests. I've got some pictures of Revolutionary War reenactors that  should work for a horse and musket game. This gets back to the roots of role playing when wargames and role playing were closely connected. If I can get a story game going here that would be something.<br/><br/>POW!<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_422906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422906/#Comment_422906" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T08:35:44+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  8:35AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a game that already fits this design goal.
