It has its flaws, but I think after a number of years of perspective and re-examination I could get a great deal of creative enjoyment and mileage out of it, were I to run it again.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>I'm moving, and need to get rid of some things. My 4E books are a good candidate for donation to a worthy home. I also can access the entire game via PDF, should I want / need to. Plus, I have a queue of games to run a million miles long, ahead of "return to 4E." With D&amp;D stuff specifically, 5E has become a reliable go-to that's easy to find players for. On top of that, 4E is dependent on technological tools for character building that I do NOT have access to.<br/><br/>BUT...<br/><br/>The counterpoint to all THAT is that the books are no longer in print, so if I give them away with this move, I'm unlikely to be able to re-acquire copies easily in the future.<br/><br/>What to do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474193/#Comment_474193" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-27T05:19:14+00:00" title="May 27, 2018  5:19AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2018 5:23AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Were I in your stead, I would dump the books. While there is a canon of RPG books of lasting value that might make sense to keep around as paper artifacts even in this era of digitalization, I do not think that 4th edition books belong in that category. This has nothing to do with the game's quality, but rather with the type of content it has: those books are pure reference materials, they do not benefit study or casual reading. Digital references will do the job as well or better. It's the kind of game where I would rather arrange and print new custom table reference folders for a campaign rather than holding onto the original books religiously.<br/><br/>In other words: those are books that want to be used and used up, not ones to be saved. Give them to somebody who wants to play the game, lug them around and refer to them until they break apart. That's the viking way, and appropriate for this type of artifact. Not all books are keepers, some are like an old-style phonebook - reference sheet stacks glorified by book-binding.<br/><br/>(Not a theoretical issue for me either, by the way - it seems that we're gearing up to play my 4th ed Chronicles of Prydain stuff seriously starting some time next month. I happen to have a couple of copies of all the 4th edition books gathering dust in the library, but I'm still considering whether I want to subject the players to that pile of unorganized confusion. It is illustrative of the value I place in the 4th edition books when I'm uncertain whether I want to involve them even when <i>actually playing the game</i>.)<br/><br/>Because it's an interesting topic, I'll also note a few examples of the kinds of rpg books that I <i>would</i> hold onto as part of a limited library:<br/><br/>(selected parts of) WoD stuff<br/>Ars Magica (5th edition line)<br/>Call of Cthulhu<br/>WFRPG (1st or 2nd edition)<br/>Dragonlance modules<br/>Paranoia (any edition, but modules only for XP)<br/>Amber<br/>Tunnels &amp; Trolls<br/>Dying Earth<br/><br/>There are a few virtues that my example "keeper" titles feature, to different degrees in different cases:<br/><b>*</b> Logically limited, reasonable-sized product line, with no dross in there<br/><b>*</b> Historically proven ever-green design or cultural impact that cannot be ignored<br/><b>*</b> Well-rounded, high-quality content that makes a well-formed book<br/><b>*</b> Highly unique and flavourful games that do not face serious competition in their niches<br/><br/>The D&amp;D 4th edition line is a failure of the art of book design, no matter my opinions on the game itself. I might just barely hold onto the revised softcovers just to have a compact rules reference on hand for later, but even those dedicate much of their page count to exhaustive class write-ups for classes that might or might not be relevant to any particular 4th ed. project I might run - I'd likely be better off with creating my own rules reference, with latest errata incorporated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DarkAlf" title="DarkAlf"><img alt="DarkAlf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/965/n08NEB40ZF3EF.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DarkAlf">DarkAlf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474194/#Comment_474194" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-27T09:31:47+00:00" title="May 27, 2018  9:31AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I might be able shine some light on this coming from the opposite perspective. Up until recently I only owned the Rules Compendium and the Monster Vault (as well as the Dungeon Master's Book). Everything else I referenced in digital format. Eventually I realized that I really like 4e and that there are <i>some</i> books I would like physical copies of for when I'm making and running adventures. These are:\n<ul>\n<li> Rules Compendium </li>\n<li> Dungeon Master's Guide </li>\n<li> Dungeon Master's Guide 2 </li>\n<li> Monster Manual 3 </li>\n<li> Monster Vault </li>\n<li> Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale </li>\n<li> Dark Sun Creature Catalog </li>\n</ul>\nThe Rules Compendium is really handy for quickly referencing rules. The DMG's are nice to have on hand for when I'm making adventures. And finally I like having the MM3-mathed monster books available if my players head off somewhere unexpected during a session. I've managed to acquire them all except the Threats to the Nentir Vale. (I wouldn't mind buying it from you if you have it and don't live so far away from Sweden as to make shipping prohibitively expensive. Tokens not required but they would be a huge bonus.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474195/#Comment_474195" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-27T11:46:01+00:00" title="May 27, 2018 11:46AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No Threats to Nentir Vale here.<br/><br/>And thanks, both of you.<br/><br/>I think, for me, Eero's right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
