                    I'm reposting this from my dusty blog, with some changes, just to see if it resonates with anyone.<br/><br/>I've been having this really negative reaction to the word "plot" lately, when I hear it used to talk about RPGs. You see, I've been listening to some of the more "general" gaming podcasts, and they often talk about things like "how to make plots", "what to do when the characters derail your plot," "if they don't take the hook chase them with your plot," and suchlike. I hear this and I just think "railroading."<br/><br/>Now, I've been guilty of this in the past oh yes. I've been the illusionist GM (and  maybe I still am to some extent) but at least I'm willing to admit it. These days I like RPGs campaigns where the story that develops emerges entirely from a collaborative effort between me and the players, and from the direct consequences of their characters' actions and interactions in game. As gamers I think many of us have been saying this for years but not really doing it. What I don't want anymore, is to "write a plot" and then force the characters to engage with it, even in the slightest way. I don't want to nudge the characters "back on track" into "my story" anymore (and god knows I've done it and done it well - that's what being a good illusionist GM is all about).<br/><br/>The two most recent campaigns I have to compare where there was clear divide between one and the other were a Deadlands game I wrapped up about two years ago and an L5R game I wrapped earlier this year. In the Deadlands game, I think I was still guiding the characters toward my own conclusions. By that point I ran things with a pretty free hand but still, I've become pretty good at giving the players the illusion that they are in control, and I could pretty much steer them in certain directions. OK, we had fun, and yes, that's the point, but I'm talking about an evolving playstyle here.<br/><br/>With L5R, I originally had some ideas about where it would all go that necessitated the characters killing themselves to go to another plane and fight the great demon lord on its own terms yadayadayada. In short I was getting ready to lay down some tracks. But when we sat down for our character jam (which I'd done before but this was the first one I went into fully aware of what we meant to accomplish), everything changed for me right there. It was really the first time I'd truly communicated with my group in regards to the campaign and what everyone wanted out of it. Ten minutes in, my original idea had been totally discarded because we were onto something far far more interesting.<br/><br/>I said my piece - I wanted a big Kurosawa epic. They wanted to play ronin. How about samurai from a fallen clan trying to reclaim their honor and titles? Fine, I said. We made characters (well, they did - I started whipping up potential NPCs, several introduced by the players) It was amazing. While they talked out their character ideas, I was listening and trying to piece things together. By the time they finished, I'd come up with a starting event - the sack of their clan stronghold. That formed the background for the campaign and we were off.<br/><br/>That campaign was driven by the goals of the characters. Things happened because of what they did and what the NPCs around them did. I was only able to set things up in front of them because that's where the players had indicated they wanted their characters to go.<br/><br/>That game was far less my "plot" than it was our "story" and I felt everyone had more of a stake in it than usual. I drove things with bangs aimed at character kickers rather than assigning goals that served my own conceptions of where the story should go. I used PC flags. I used relationship maps. Fantastic! What would have happened if Tony's character Nobutada had killed the Emperor when he had sword in hand at the Imperial neck, and decided to side with the bad guys? I don't know (and it's a great 'what-if') but had he done it it would have been equally as cool as the story that grew out of the choice he did make.<br/><br/>I recently ran Mission Arcturus for the old sci-fi game 2300AD. We had a total blast. I changed things in the adventure a bit, but in the end, let's face it, it's an Old School adventure and quite literally a pipe that funneled the PCs to the outcome. We enjoyed the hell out of that session (because we all bought into the set up going in) but it did leave me wanting to open things up more. The first adventure I ran in that campaign was my own, and I hit the characters with a few bangs (quite big ones too - it's an interstellar war y'know!) It worked out great and I wanted to go back to that style for the finale. I'd planned to run another of GW's old adventures (Operation Overlord) but that's got some trackage to it as well. Plus it wasn't about the characters. The solution? I looked at their character sheets, whipped up some bangs based on their flags, and set them off. I asked the players what sort of overall situation they wanted and as a group they told me (a glorius last stand basically). I gave them what they asked for. Result? Mega-awesome fun. It's our story again.<br/><br/>I don't want to run characters in "my" story or "your" story, I want them to be in OUR story, and one that grows entirely from the actions of the characters and the people they interact with. I also want to reject the idea that the players can "derail your plot" - a phrase that now really rubs me the wrong way. If the game is a collaborative effort, then there is no plot to derail because the players and their characters (and you, the GM) are pursuing shared goals. And it's not directionless either, which I think is a key point - the story can have a recognizable narrative arc as the PC pursue those shared goals. The L5R game sure did. So did the 2300AD campaign.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I can see how greater self-awareness with regards to my playstyle is improving the fun I have running and playing RPGs.                </div>

                            That's very awesome.<br/><br/>I recently ran a D&amp;D game with Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium rules (well, rules from the revised edition of Dread).  Anyhow, part of the process of character creation involved a lengthy discussion of what kind of game situation the players were interested in.  What kind of world, what kind of conflicts.  The fact is, they weren't interested in an open-ended scenario full of emotional stuff, they just wanted a dungeon to wander around in and some asses to kick.  Goblins, maybe.  So that's what I gave them, but I think that just hashing it all out before the dice-rolling made for a really satisfying adventure, in part because everyone had the reassuring understanding that the game was going to deliver the kind of experience they were in the mood for.<br/><br/>The added personal investment inherent in a player-authored world also gives them more of a motivation and personal attachment to the scenarios and settings, I've found.  The more work they do to flesh out the random stuff (what part of town they live in, what kind of car they drive, or what kind of castle they live in, whatever the hell), the more ownership they feel.<br/><br/>The thing about railroading is -- I don't know, it's like video games.  Sometimes, I want to play something open-ended and huge, a sandbox game like GTA3 or Morrowind.  Other times, I want a linear, tightly controlled experience where I don't have as much authority over the sequence of events.  Those linear games can make for some pretty hair-raising moments, because the author (the game developer) can plan and plot and scheme, and can therefore create a specific user experience.  It's just a question of what I feel like playing.<br/><br/>In the same way, I think that really talking to your players about what specific experiences they're interested in can make for a more satisfying game session.<br/><br/>So yeah, I totally agree with you about awareness.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

I hear you. Mission: Arcturus for 2300AD was like that. It promised an "Aliens" style experience, which it did deliver, and that is totally what everyone wanted. The tradeoff was the linearity, but we were all down with that, so it was good. Then we went back to more open character driven stuff for the finale, and it was good too.

                            Yea, plot is one of those dirty words for me too. I think I never really got on that bandwagon. Oh, I've had micro-plots for a particular adventure, and probably forced things occaisionally, but mostly not. I know I have often quickly dismissed modules that had way too much forced plot.<br/><br/>I remember trying to play 7th Sea with a friend. I started to run the introductory module. By the end of our first and only game session, we both agreed that the whole thing was totally railroaded.<br/><br/>And looking back, I know I never ran the A series Slaver modules because of their plot dependency. And though I ran the G series Giant modules, and at least some of the D series Drow modules, there were even plot elements in those that I ignored (they, especially the G series modules, were mostly a standard dungeon crawl).<br/><br/>So what you talk about really resonates with me, even if I was never really on the other side of the fence.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            A couple years ago, I had an idea for a d6 Star Wars adventure and I wrote it up, as an adventure. When I looked at it when I was done, I realized what I had was a great *story* but probably a lousy RPG adventure - everything about it took story control out of the hands of the players, every choice the players had to make was either meaningless or led to the same place. The worst thing was, I knew I could pull it off - I knew I could run my group through it and they'd probably eat it up.  It was like a frying pan in the face - I shelved it, and never ran it (thinking perhaps of actually writing it as a short story). I think that was the beginning of this paradigm shift I've been having over the past two years, though I didn't know it at the time.                        </div>

Since I got married about 7 years ago, I've only run what many would consider "short" campaigns of 3 to 9 sessions total. This happened naturally, as my group was only able to manage a game about once a month (or once every other month) because of scheduling issues. The 2300AD game we played was only three sessions but it took us 4 months to complete!<br/><br/>As a result, we go into every campaign knowing that it will end, and I think this knowledge helps me (and the players) stay focused, and drives some sort of build up to some sort of resolution of all the issues that arise in play.<br/><br/>I don't want to play or run open-ended campaigns any more.                        </div>

Not really.  In a traditional GM-Player structure, you're often in the position of taking the back seat to the actions of the players.  Your creative input is the backdrop or the obstacle to be defeated - it's also often unrewarded in the mechanical sense.  It's natural that a GM would want more recognition for their efforts and moments to shine as well.  <br/><br/>That's what I think drives the GM-lessness of a lot of new-gen games: the designers, having been GMs, want their cake and to eat it too - they want to be as rewarded as the players, to be a player in all but title.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't think that the GM structure is in any way as obsolete as some would like to make it.  Certainly a 'hand on the rudder' is a good way to make sure that there's forward motion, a <i>telos</i>, in the narrative of the game.                        </div>

                            "Plot" sometimes gets used to mean "situation", "dilemma", "setup", "premise". For example, <a href="http://www.io.com/~sjohn/plots.htm" rel="nofollow">S.

Agreed. I react badly to the word when it means "The story that I, the GM, have prepared for the players, and they will experience the events and conclusions that I have planned, and if they deviate from these points, I will force them back onto it."<br/><br/>Thumbing through the GM advice in some old games, I am also getting bad reactions whenever I see something like "It is the GM's responsibility to entertain the players." Faw! Not for me anymore! I react even more negatively when I see the same type of GM advice in any game published within the last two to three years...                        </div>
