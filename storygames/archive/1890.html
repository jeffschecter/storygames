                    For those who missed the original thread, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1874" rel="nofollow">go here</a>. In short, this is a collective design thread for a fantasy d20 supplement called <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=20150" rel="nofollow">Permafrost</a>. Feel free to put your two cents in.<br/><br/>So, here are some of the major items that the reviewers brought up, in no particular order:<br/>1. No hint as to what the original disaster was<br/>2. More detailed adventure ideas needed<br/>3. Updated "back-cover blurb" needed that reflects what's really inside<br/>4. No art<br/>5. No map<br/>6. No NPCs<br/>7. No info on the cities<br/><br/>They said other things too, but those are the ones I care about, and the ones I want to focus on.<br/><br/>Here are my personal constraints:<br/>1. I'm writing my thesis, which means I'm mostly going to be in an editing capacity here.<br/>2. I'm poor. I have a total of $50 for artwork, which I think might best be used to have someone make a map of the Great Dark. I can probably get public domain pictures of frosty places without too much trouble.<br/><br/>Matt, Tad, I'll be relying a good amount on you guys for interesting setting details. As I've said, this is not my forte. The current setting info for Permafrost is in the next post down, for those who don't have a copy yet, and anyone else who has ideas is more than welcome to put in a few words (or more).<br/><br/>I'd like to start by "growing" things off the existing setting description. Pick one place, person, or group, and expand on it. Point out something that seems like it should naturally be there and explain why it's missing or secret. Invent NPCs to fill major leadership roles, but avoid the Elminster Problem (i.e. make sure they clearly need the PCs for something).<br/><br/>--Colin<br/><br/>P.S.: What do you get for helping out? Mostly your name in the book - see constraint <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above. I can also hand out complimentary copies of any of my other games, and will be glad to do so.                </div>

                            Here's the setting info from the book. Nearly all of it.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago there was a major planar accident, an epic-level screwup of such magnitude that it pushed the prime material plane out of its place in the cosmos. Ever since then the world has been getting colder and colder. After two solid years of winter, the people in the north started moving south. They went a little farther each time, hoping it would all just stop so they could live their lives. Five years ago the northerners finally traveled so far south that they ran into the people who had been moving north. The whole world is in the worst ice age you can imagine â€” the equatorâ€™s frozen and the poles are wide-open portals to the paraelemental plane of Ice. If not for magic, everyone would be dead. There are only a quarter million people left alive.<br/><br/>There are three major outposts in this world still capable of supporting life. First is the Steaming Mountain, where the Magma Mages live. This active volcano is one of the few places thatâ€™s still warm enough to grow crops on a regular basis, as the ground itself produces enough heat. The mages and their protectors, the Core Seekers, are looking for a way to tap into the warmth left in the worldâ€™s core and heat everything back up. About 80,000 people live on the slopes and foothills of the Steaming Mountain.<br/><br/>Next is Crystalhome, a vast domed city made of magical crystal. The wizard Laccia created this whole place on her own before traveling to the outer planes to look for help. That was six years ago. Crystalhome is run by the Adepts, a band of monks whoâ€™ve had to put their training on hold to deal with this town showing up on their doorstep. Crystalhome is about thirty miles away from the Steaming Mountain. The Planar Initiates, disciples of Laccia, make their home here as well, using the crystal to peer into the multiverse, seeking an answer. Crystalhome has about 150,000 inhabitants.<br/><br/>Last is the Great Dark, the vast system of catacombs beneath the world where the cold has not yet penetrated. The core seekers delve into these underground vaults and tombs, but they do not make it their home. That right belongs to the Naga Cultists, who draw their power from allegiance to the great snake-people, and to the Servants of Death, who solemnly watch over those buried here. Both of these groups have been seen above-ground in recent years, and their influence is growing as the Great Darkâ€™s population increases. There are only 20,000 humans and demihumans there, but the population of monstrous humanoids is much larger.<br/><br/>In the snowy wilderness, one can find few survivors. Those who refuse to move to the Mountain, Crystalhome, or the Dark eventually succumb to the blistering cold. Only three kinds of people can be found here: the Knights of the Snows, whose fey goddess protects them from the cold; the Iceborn Raiders, who steal from others to survive; and the Mad Hermits who survived when others perished, and have paid the price in their sanity.<br/><br/>There is one thin ray of hope. Last year some people seemed to fall deathly ill, eventually entering glowing cocoons and emerging hale and healthy, with unexpected powers and different personalities. Most of them were young, none more than twenty years old. Each had a message: they were archons, sent by the gods of the Upper Planes to be reborn in living flesh, to help the people of this world. Some take this as an indication that Laccia succeeded in her quest, but others point out that the cold is still growing.<br/><br/>-=-=-=-=-=-=-                        </div>

                            Other setting bits from elsewhere in the book:<br/><br/>Most humanoid races in this world are the result of magical experimentation with humans. Elves come from fey blood, orcs were the result of an epic curse against an entire kingdom, dwarves came from people who wanted to be stronger and did something about it, and halflings were the result of a seriously disturbed wizardâ€™s perverted desire for children who never grew up. Gnomes are the exception; theyâ€™re actually a different species entirely. Most people donâ€™t know this, though itâ€™s recorded (often in allegorical form) in the various racesâ€™ religious texts.                        </div>

                            And the existing plot seeds from the back:<br/><br/>Things that Might Save The World<br/>1.	Finding out what happened to send the world towards the paraplane of ice in the first place, and reversing it.<br/>2.	Drawing the paraplane of magma closer.<br/>3.	Stoking up the inexhaustible heat of the Core until the ground itself grows warm.<br/>4.	Calling on the gods for aid (either the old ones, or an entirely new set that might care more about your world).<br/>5.	Fighting the masters of the paraplane of ice to convince them they don't want to be near you.<br/>6.	A massive enchantment that lets everyone adapt to the cold.<br/>7.	Retreating into the Great Dark until the conjunction is over and the world returns to balance.<br/>8.	Traveling back in time to prevent the original mishap.<br/>9.	Defeating the Snowflake Queen, who is the real mastermind behind all of this.<br/>10.	Stealing a piece of the sun to warm the planet.<br/><br/>Things to Do in Social Games<br/>1.	Keep the peace in the crowded halls of Crystalhome.<br/>2.	Settle a growing dispute that could leave Crystalhome without food and the Steaming Mountain without any tools.<br/>3.	Make peace with the denizens of the Great Dark.<br/>4.	Claim the overland world for the nagas. Alternatively, infiltrate the naga cults to prevent them from taking over.<br/>5.	Become the leader of the iceborn raiders.<br/>6.	Use your persuasive ways to seek aid in the outer planes.<br/>7.	Become the Snowflake Queen's consort.<br/>8.	Seek out and cure mad hermits.<br/>9.	Control the Crystalhome/Mountain trade route.<br/>10.	Play a band of mad hermits who want to make everyone mad.<br/><br/>Other Plot Hooks and Questions<br/>1.	Perhaps victory is really impossible, and the only answer is an exodus to a new prime material plane.<br/>2.	Travel north. Find dead bodies. Go on resurrection spree.<br/>3.	Stop a mummy lord from animating all the bodies that froze.<br/>4.	Where is Laccia and what really happened to her?<br/>5.	Is this happening to just this prime material, or all of them?<br/>6.	What are the dragons up to during all this?<br/>7.	Can you tell who's going to become a reborn archon?<br/>8.	Are the mad hermits' ice spirits organized? Do they have a plan?

Why do the nagas care so much about what we do?<br/><br/>And Now That You've "Won"...<br/>1.	Is the world headed towards a collision with the paraplane of magma now?<br/>2.

What will become of the knights of the snow?<br/>6.	Will the Steaming Mountain explode from all th extra heat the magma mages pumped into it?<br/>7.

Will the magma mages be overwhelmed with madness as the warmth makes them more powerful?<br/>9.	How can we prevent this from happening again?<br/>10.	How much does it cost to buy a tavern? Can I hire an old guy to sit in the corner, wear a beard, and send young adventurers on bogus quests? Man, would that be funny.                        </div>

Compensation: Like I said in the other thread I will help out gratis, something pinged on multiple levels for me. But I will not be adverse to free copies of something else. Trade / barter is perfectly acceptable.<br/>
Can you post the back cover blurb or whisper it so I can see what it says, and that is my 1st step. An odd one but what hits first on that list. After that will be some broad sweeping thoughts on the overall setting. Also the original disaster and details will ping my interest. <br/>

                            Is it true that there's really NO art? It's occurred to me you can probably score some royalty-free snowflake clip art and use that to break up the text flow a bit. I bet your word processor includes such a thing. That's gotta be like the most ubiquitous clip art in the world or something.                        </div>

Far as look / feel goes since i have not bought it yet, do you want fantasy style art look, would live photos be out of place, etc. Since it is your baby and a couple of us are helping to groom it a smidgen what is the overall graphic look supposed to be anyway.                        </div>

I know this might sound a little self absorbed, but you should really check out my Blog.  I did a whole article on how to get cheap/free artwork.  Check out this link here:<br/>
<br/>

I really do hope that helps.<br/>

                            Thanks, Troy. I really appreciate it. I've been using Wikimedia Commons for plant and bug pictures for my Donjon supplement, and it's been very helpful. I'll have to check out some of the other places.<br/><br/>Larry, there are indeed some snowflakes in the background of every page, but none that "break up the text." Finding a free snowflake font is actually not as easy as it might seem - many are "free for non-commercial use" - but I dug one up.                        </div>

                            Dude!<br/>Glad I just popped by SG for a gander, or I would have missed this. Last night the little dragon woke us up with leg cramps and I had trouble regaining sleep mode. So, I found myself unable to stop thinking about Permafrost. In my groggy state I caught myself thinking (and please forgive me for this) "It comes off as half-assed". I was immediately chagrinned and startled into wakefulness by this thought. As a consequence, though, I was thinking of ways to revise the product listing (is that what you're calling the back-cover blurb?) to better reflect the contents, and also of ways to rearrange the existing content to better present the idea-sparking minimalist approach. 'Cause I don't think it <i>is </i>half-assed, just that it could seem that way. I'll email you about that stuff, along with the proofread results, so as not to bore everyone.<br/><br/>Also some thoughts:  $$Moolah$$ â€” would you consider investors?<br/>                                Art â€” saw some stock art portfolios at RPGNow averaging around $20. Didn't look too hard, so I don't know if there might be anything useful.<br/>                                Remuneration â€” would you consider royalties?                        </div>

Plus, a part of me thinks it'd just be giving in if you respond to the criticism by making Permafrost what they expected rather than what you wanted it to be.<br/><br/><b>Random setting ideas:</b><br/><br/>People moving into the great dark seems like an ideal excuse for conflict.  I can imagine existing (prehaps formerly unknown) subterranean entities resenting the surface people spilling into their realm.  This could either be distinct from the naga cultists - they would be the people that have "gone native" so to speak and turned on their fellows - or merged.<br/><br/>Dragons.  It seems wrong to have a D&amp;D setting not <i>mention</i> dragons.  What if most of the dragons ae gone, and make this a mystery of the setting.  Some say they saw the permafrost coming and fled to another plane.  Others that they caused the disaster and most perished in it.  And so on.  You could restrict dragons to whites, who are right at home in the current world, excepting oddball individuals the GM might introduce for plot purposes.<br/><br/>The warmth from underground magma seems a nifty element, and I have an unreasonable love for "between a rock and a hard place".  What if you personified the heat of the earth?  It may provide respite from the cold of the surface, but its nature is hostile to the surface people.  Say that this world has a very active core (perhaps a direct link to the elemental plane of fire/magam?), hungry rivers of magma always reaching up to the surface.  Whole societies of fire-aspected creatures worshipping its divine (sentient?) power.  The arctic apocalypse has sent people hunting for heat sources and they've found this ancient hostile enemy.  So yeah - rock and hard place - make the geological heat not just dangerous but <i>hostile</i>.  They're not the big bad, but they're <i>there</i>. Also supernatural cold+supernatural heat = being able to say "fuck you" to plausibility when you want cool magma vs ice imagery.  <br/><br/>I am also a big fan of complementry opposites.  What if you de-personified the cold.  What I mean is, try to make even the cold-based <i>monsters</i> like mindless forces of nature.  Say that certain of the weirder, nastier cold-based monsters only made an appearance with this eternal winter and that they seem to be <i>of</i> it.  Not sure exactly which ones - but one or two well-chosen "iconic" examples might be enough for flavour.<br/>One crazy idea would be if the undead are a new phenomena in this setting, directly caused by the frozen conditions.  Creatures that are killed by exposure, frozen to death, or the like don't rest easy and become forces <i>of</i> the unnatural cold.  <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=121136" rel="nofollow">Rimed skeletons</a>.  Corpsicle zombies.  Snow wraiths.  Which gives an extra justification to the "no turning undead" thing.  It also opens room for fun colour text about how societies cope with this knowledge - cremating frostburnt corpses and so on.  It interacts badly with the death-aspected character classes though.  You <i>could</i> distinguish between cold-born undead and the "natural" kind I suppose, but that may require flavour backflips.<br/><br/>To keep the character classes (which are the real core of the supplement) central, I'd explicitly tie them to setting elements.  So maybe, for each class there's a couple of examples of how they exist in the world.  For the reborn archons, for example, maybe detail a religion that believes they are evidence that the gods have died and that the archons are inhabitted by fragments of their pwoer that fell to earth.  And maybe a singularly powerful reborn that's posing as a fallen angel and gathering other reborn archons to his side with his compelling rhetoric (and numerous "mortal" followers too, natch).<br/><br/>This has been quite a long post so I'll stop.  But a couple more random undeveloped ideas:<br/><br/>*A weird, sheltered area that's been flash-frozen.  Trees, people and buildings all preserved inside a layer of ice.  A freaky snapshot of how the world was before this winter.<br/>*A nomadic people with odd customs that lived in the arctic areas of the world before everywhere froze - now they're found across the whole world.  They probably think the way everyone else copes is quaint.<br/>*An area of fragile, snow-covered lava tubes.  It's dangerous to cross because many of the tubes will crumble under bodyweight, and the thick snow makes it impossible to tell where it's safe to tread.  Visuals include pillars of steam rising from where the magma has been recently exposed, flowing across the snow.                        </div>

                            Hey Colin, Matt, everyone else who is participating,<br/>
<br/>
Got a question as I just let my mind and fingers dive into this somewhat today. How do you all prefer to correspond? In here, via email, what about sharing files, preferred format between us all. I am PC, Windows, Word myself with capacity to pdf as well. So just tossing this question out and can I / We see the original Table of Contents also. Also on an aside note what is your word count with and without character classes. I dont think we want to do anything much to them except maybe on the background of them as we further flesh out the overall setting / world. <br/>
I have snatched all the stuff you posted here Colin and pasted into a word doc, so I can work with it easier personally.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding the more I dive into this, the more I look at it, that I really like it a lot Colin. You made it implicit in the setting with the character classes their goals and aims, unlike in most gaming situations (see some other threads on here about differences between SF and Fantasy novels and also character goals) you made it implicit in here, allowing for the player characters to be needed in the world from the beginning, instead of the old farmer son off to find his fortune in the big city, or just a random bunch of steel armed marauders of the underground locations. I like that a lot Colin. <br/>
<br/>
enough there, talk soon<br/>

                            Okay, I've done some proofreading, and I'm seveteen fortyseconds through with minimal issues. I expect to finish the read today or tomorrow with those results (piddly stuff, so far. Way to self-edit!).<br/><br/>Now for some layout suggestions:<br/>â€¢	First, the text seems cramped, to me. I suggest opening it up by instituting chapters starting on separate pages. I can think of five or six, which I'll hit in a later bullet<br/>â€¢	Next, open up the text so it doesnâ€™t look lost on the screen, by taking 10â€“20% off the side margins. Top and bottom seem good.<br/>â€¢	If youâ€™re going to have a print version, make it portrait aspect, since most people prefer that for binding and later perusal.<br/>â€¢	Finally, before going into writing more "fluff", let's consider reworking the layout to place the important stuff (classes) first, with the other components to follow in order of importance.<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspo	Introduction â€” first after the title page, as now, but we need more than two sentences, and they should introduce and laud the classes as the meat, then describe what weâ€™ll find following those.<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspo	Table of Contents, Table of Tables, Credits, Legalese â€” Probably two pages, with page one housing the TOC and TOT in separate columns, and the second with the Credits and Legalese (Hereâ€™s where you state what rights you keep and give up, etc., but keep that lengthy OGL at the end with a hyperlink here. While youâ€™re at it, hyperlink the TOC and TOT. Yeah, I know youâ€™ve got bookmarks, but itâ€™s all about me, the lazy consumer, so double up.<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspo	Classes â€” Possibly needs a better title. Here youâ€™ll want sections like so:<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Notes on CharGen<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Synopses of Classes (Actually, I might prefer this as a side bar within CharGen)<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Core Classes<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspo	Mechanics Quirks â€” discuss here the spell loss and compensation, signature spells, etc. that you already have on page 35<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspo	Setting Suggestions â€” Note that here is the core of my Cunning Planâ„¢. By treating the setting as suggestion, a few ideas to spark things off, you downplay itâ€™s significance, and hopefully no one will complain that you cheated them, though many will still pine for more juice to choke down the fiber in the Class chapter. Just teasing. Anyway, sections similar to:<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Suggested Backstory<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Plot hooks<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Any more fluff we come up with<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Possibly a quick and easy conversion from class to prestige class, for those who want to use them that way.<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspo	Authorâ€™s Notes â€” Quite frankly, Most People donâ€™t care what the author thinks and assumes Authorâ€™s notes are conceits (a fact lamented by the great Piers Anthony, and one of the reasons he stopped including the copious ones at the back of Incarnations of Immortality, mores the pity). Those that do care will seek them out and learn from them.<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Design notes â€” paragraphs two and three, discussing setting the feel of permafrost should probably be moved to the Suggested Setting Elements chapter.<br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspï‚§	Your Q&amp;A â€” some of the Q/A pairs might seem awkward here, but placing it where you do is a big speed bump. <br/>&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspo	OGL<br/><br/>Okay, thatâ€™s enough for now, I think. Feedback?<br/>SlaintÃ¨                        </div>

We did the same sort of thing with <i>Legends of Alyria</i>.  Check out <a href="http://www.lulu.com/darkomengames" rel="nofollow">the preview</a> and the <a href="http://alyria.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">game text</a> for some ideas.  My wife was able to make the book look good using only free dingbat fonts, and I've been adamantly opposed to a map for Alyria since the beginning.  I'm not trying to shill my game here, but I do think that you might find some inspiration looking at what we did.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra                        </div>

                            something invaded my head in reference to Thomas' talk of opposites and ice above/magma below. <br/>i also want to say, i am a fan of leaving the background open to a degree. I was not a big fan of Dragonlance because it seemed like there was no room to make my own story. Anyway,  i was thinking whatever  (alien space bats, as S.M. Sterling would say) caused the huge shift rotated and weakened the walls between planes. The elemental plane of fire now exists inside the world and the elemental plane of water exists around the world it or eclipses it.<br/>  The heat drives the cold to the edges and topside is frozen while the inside is molten.  This could also alleviate the map issue. The landscape could be constantly melting, freezing and reforming.    <br/><br/>This change, perpetrated by what or whom was, lost in the shift, never really found out, not as important as staying alive to the survivors.                        </div>

                            The path was barely visible now that the snow was falling again. He hurried through the forest of dead trees, petrified and made immutable by the terrible cold. The crunch of fresh snow underfoot was the only sound to each his pained, blistering ears. Above his head, a cold bluish sun hung high in the sky and he had brief memories of running through this forest as a child, naked and laughing, enjoying the summer warmth. <br/><br/>The walker wore woven vests under a mantle of animal skins, some older than he was for the use of animals for their skins was now anathema. Not when they could be used for warm milk, breeding stock and body heat. Under his many layers, beside his skin to keep them from freezing, he kept a bottle of milk and some breads with butter and cheese. In his right hand he clutched a walking staff, used to test the depth of snowdrifts and in his left, a crystal periapt. If the cold became too much, it would save him, but only once. His skin was ruddy and cracked from the bitter chill and he constantly had to brush ice from his eyes and nose. He wriggled his toes in his great boots, made from ten layers of the finest threads and wools. He was warm from his exertions.<br/><br/>At last he could ignore his hunger no more and sat down on a frozen log to eat. His hands, staying inside his layered poncho, grasped the cheesy breads and he submerged his head into his clothing to eat. His fingers were cold, despite his layers but the bread was chewy and the cheese warm and soft. He thought about his home, twenty miles behind him and then his destination, the volcano of the Magma Mages. A few miles more and the great column of steam would be visible and his journey would nearly be over.<br/><br/>What had brought him out of his crystal dome? What was important enough for a lone traveller to be given a crystal periapt and sent on his way? He didn't know. The Initiates had called and he had been there to answer. What could have been so important? Sated from the breads, he closed his eyes and mentally prepared himself for the next part of the journey. <br/><br/>He woke with a start. His vision was misted from ice crystals on his lashes and there was a layer of snow upon his chest. He tried to stand but realised with a sickening lurch that he could no longer feel his toes. His hands flailed for his stick but it was nowhere to be seen. He wiped the snow from his eyes with his useless frozen fingers stared into the white.<br/><br/>The Periapt, he thought. It was still in his hand, encased in frozen flesh and wool. He tore with his teeth at the cloth and  tasted frozen meat - he was tearing the flesh from his fingers but there was no pain. Eventually he could see the periapt, crystalline and calming in his ruined hand and he concentrated upon its faceted surfaces. A glow began to spread from that hand and with it, the pain of returning sensation. He muttered a prayer to Laccia, wherever she was, as the periapt brought sensation back to frost-bitten limbs and the pain took him. His tears, freezing upon contact with the air, fell from his cheeks into the snow as he started to black out. <br/><br/>A memory of sun through the trees was his last thought as the cold took him.                        </div>

                            To be fair, I think the "factions" need some work. "Mages of the Steaming Mountain" sounds better than "Magma Mages".<br/><br/>I'd prefer to work in a wiki or something. I'm doing much the same with my LateGaming wiki for three games (2 older, one for the Translatlantic Game Design contest) at the moment and it's helping.

                            Wow, Matt. That was pretty awesome. I love the detail where he had to eat inside his clothes. You spend a lot of time in subzero weather?<br/><br/>I just tried to set up a quick wiki at <a href="http://www.schtuff.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.schtuff.com/</a>, which I have used before, but I was having trouble with java scripting. Apparently they haven't kept up with IE7 changes, because it always worked fine in IE6, and their "fix" didn't work. Anyway, perhaps that's properly something Colin should see to.

Yes, what <i>would </i> the denizens os the different locations call each other. Most monikers would be reverent, as they're all depending on each other, some not so much. Raiders would probably sneer at the settlements, calling them lavaboys and crystal huggers and molerats or some such.                        </div>

                            Actually I live in a pretty temperate but unassailably cool place <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>We need to establish the relationships too. And Colin obviously has veto on all of this. so...<br/><br/>"Wizards of the Mountain"<br/>When the Great Cold came, not everyone hid in their homes and watched the tendrils of ice creep across the floor seeking heat as roots search for water; a group of Wizards took matters into their own hands and over the course of three days summoned great magic to make warmth where there was none. On the first day, they created a group of rocks which heated their small settlement but news spread and soon people began to flock to this settlement. On the second day, purely out of compassion, they raised a hundred such stones and set them to burn eternally to provide warmth for the folk who flocked to them. During the day they summoned mighty feasts to feed the hungry but still it was not enough. Those who could not get close enough to the stones were taken by the cold. And as people died in the crush to get closer to the stones, the Wizards held a pivotal meeting and the decision was made. <br/><br/>On the second night the Wizards withdrew from the haven they created and went to the top of a nearby mountain, whose name was Mutheir, meaning "Sky Look". They kept their plans secret, even from their most trusted retainers and by the fall of night on the third day, Sky Look was no more. A mighty eruption shook the very ground and molten rock and ash spilled into the air and poured skyward for as far as the eye could see. Terrified, the people in the settlements waited for the rain of hot ash and sulphur but none came. As night came on and brought the cold, the followers of the Wizards gathered whom they could and herded them to the slopes of this newly formed volcano with everpresent tongues of lava which spill from vents. This was to be their new home. The mountain could house hundreds of thousands and keep them safe and warm. They would never again fear the cold. <br/><br/>The Wizards were never seen again, though their retainers profess to serve them still in complete secrecy. Still, every now and then tales arise of Wizards whose touch will sear the flesh from your bones, whose hair is that of fire and whose eyes smoulder like eternal embers. Every year, ten young men and women are taken into the Citadel of Magma in the heart of the Mountain to be trained as Wizards. It is said they will spend the rest of their days learning to tame the Magma until the Cold eventually retreats. When they return to their people, it is evident they have found a new love in the fires of the Earth.<br/><br/>In the absence of their saviours, the People of the Mountain have become dissatisfied with their lot and envy the easier life rumoured to be had in CrystalHome, several days travel away. If not for the danger of the journey, many would leave. None of them will ever realise the sacrifices made in their name, the story of ten men and women, Wizards who can no longer bear the touch of another human without maiming them, who cannot see anything but the darkness of cold and who feel the burn of elemental magma every day of their lives.                        </div>

                            "The Palace of Crystal"The refuge that would become known as Crystalhome started out as a large crystalline villa in a warm land constructed by the Wizard Ledon for his lover Laccia, another powerful Wizard. When the Cold came upon it, Ledon and Laccia fortified their home against the frost and snow and assumed it would pass. As the people began to suffer, Laccia begged Ledon to help her build some more refuges and at first he refused. She persisted and her compassion won him over and he began to extend the villa to house the hundreds of people who flocked to them for refuge. Every day when they woke they would find the refuges to be packed beyond reasonable capacity and huge crowds huddled outside. With a certain dread, Ledon knew his magic would not be enough. He and Laccia made their lovers pact and with their people dying, ill prepared for the cold, Ledon was transformed into living magical crystal. That day, the villa embodied all of Ledon's power and it was under the sole control of Laccia and the adepts she would train. Each day it would grow, embodied with Ledon's spirit and the very soul of his magic and each day Laccia would walk the halls and talk with her lover whose laughter could be heard in the eaves of every roof. And still the crystal palace grew and grew to accomodate the people until, eventually Laccia could no longer hear the voice of her lover and with her loss, came her need to find a solution to the Cold and maybe then Ledon could return. For years she toiled with solutions until eventually she bid farewell to her acolytes and vanished. Her journey would take her beyond the world she knew, past the plane of Cold, into mysterious, wonderful and dangerous places and one day she might find the solution and free her lover.<br/><br/>The people of CrystalHome are content. Great gardens grow their food though livestock are precious and though life is hard, they see the cold only when they gaze through the soul-enchanted crystal to the world beyond. The Adepts maintain the domed city and claim to be able to hear the guidance of Ledon while the Planar Initiates dispute this, maintaining that if Laccia could not hear her lover, then no-one could.<br/><br/>The truth is much more tragic. Both Ledon and Laccia are lost. In some areas of the city, the people can feel a sense of terrible loss and ennui. And they avoid those areas of the city which make them feel miserable. The Planar Initiates, acolytes of Laccia, are desperately trying to contact their mistress and finding that she has disappeared completely.<br/><br/>CrystalHome runs the only trade caravans. Land-ships crafted of living crystal glides across the ice and snow to relay food, messages, supplies. Of late many have falled prey to raiders but still, the trade routes must be plied by someone.                        </div>

                            Nice work, Matt. Can't wait to see what you come up with for the Dark. <br/><br/>I especially like the touch of Ledon's sacrifice. Perhaps a way can be found to allow him to localize his essence for limited times, to speak with the Adepts. If that were to happen, and he could speak to the normal inhabitants, he would easily be deified.<br/><br/>Both stories seem fairly tight and consistent with Colin's world. I don't see any holes, yet. Anyone else?                        </div>

                            Colin and folks,<br/>
<br/>
I have like two wikis and a ton of webhost space.<br/>
<br/>
You can have a new subsection in either <a href="http://wiki.trevismartin.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.trevismartin.org</a> (pmwiki is the engine) or in <a href="http://uniwiki.trevismartin.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://uniwiki.trevismartin.org</a> (twiki is the engine.) I'll make Colin an admin.  Or I can set up a totally seperate one just for you in a new subdomain in about 2 seconds (okay maybe three)  In either Pmwiki, TWiki or Mediawiki.<br/>
<br/>
And I might like to do an art piece or two depending on your prospective schedule ( and mine)<br/>
<br/>
(okay, 2 seconds is exaggerating.  It would take about an hour for the subdomain to propogate.)<br/>
<br/>
Offer is open.<br/>
<br/>
best<br/>

                            The Dark<br>Before the Great Cold, the world was divided. There were those who lived and thrived under the sun and walked among the trees and drank from the rivers. Their life was carefree, filled with toil and joy, for they had not a care in the world. But the others, who kept to the silent black halls of the Dark, mocked them for their simple ways and ephemeral lives. The Naga Cultists were artists, spending their days creating great underground sculptures and other works from the living rock. Their guiding hands, the immortal and cruel Naga, were the guardians of the art and inspired creativity. While some may believe the art of the Naga to be sadistic at best, and monstrous at times, their art was as enchanting as their lidless, slitted eyes. The Naga Cult is welcoming to those who have not found solace elsewhere and among their communities you can find humans and non-humans of all kinds. Every cultist who leaves the warmth of the Dark brings tales of a free and egalitarian society where the Cold does not bite at your flesh nor take hold in your heart. Naga Cult missionaries are sent in groups to Crystalhome and the Mountain to welcome new converts. They bring their enchanting art to trade and some individuals have risen in society. Among the residents of Crystalhome, the Naga cultists are throught to be decadent, immoral and fascinating icons of sexuality and danger. Their art is not appreciated among the People of the Mountain whose hard life leaves them immune to such petty baubles. But the Cultists bring news, mystery and hope.<br>The typical Naga Cultist is a pale-skinned, very attractive humanoid with definite reptilian characteristics. This includes slitted eyes, nictating membranes, forked tongues, scaled parts of their flesh, unparalleled flexibility and poisonous saliva or sweat bringing deliria, madness or death. Often heavily made-up, the Naga Cultist is a mask behind which lies their utter dedication to their timeless Naga masters.<br><br>The Naga shared the dark with the Servants of Death. In ages past, these sombre individuals were responsible for the preservation of the dead, embalming of the heroes and legendary champions of old but as the heroes disappeared, they became more insular and now are reputed to steal from the graves of the surface dwellers in order to exercise their ancient rites. While the Naga are the guardians of art, the Servants are the historians and loremasters. Among their catacombs are the works of ages. Some written by the hands of heroes, some by the Servants scribing the lives of champions from communing with their spirits. The Servants of Death venture forth from their catacombs upon the deaths of notaries to offer their arts of preservation and to send their scribe-spiritualists to document their lives. What is not known is that they also journey overland to the dead towns and villages of the land and recover the frozen dead for storage and possible re-animation. It's only a matter of time before someone from your past, someone you knew to be dead, shows up wearing the shroud and veil of the Servants of Death.<br>The typical Servant of Death wears a charcoal shroud and veil to cover their pale, corpulent, light-sensitive flesh. They can be of any race that knows death and their entourages carry a palanquin of ritual materials and magical scribing parchments for the recording of history. <br><br>There is not much prejudice in this world because there is not enough room for hate in a world that is dying from the Cold. Even evil races can co-exist for mutual benefit as survival requires co-operation.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Dwarven Ice Lords<br>The Dwarves have a distorted view of the world. They do not see themselves as short, squat humanoids, but rather that the world has elongated. Humans and Elves are tall, willowy creatures and trres are dark petrified spindles.<br><br>Their origins are shrouded in long lost memories though the archives of the Servants of Death refer to them as being a human people who voluntarily took on a great enchantment to change them in bone, sinew and soul.<br><br>Dwarves are extraordinarily hardy and resistant to the cold. They wear cloth and furs for comfort though a dwarf can last in the Cold (at least during the day) without serious hardship and will never succumb to frostbite. When they travel, they travel in comfort and hide their faces behind stylised masks with terrible visages. They apply engineering techniques to build their fortresses out of carved ice, structures that will never melt or falter and which can be rebuilt with the plentiful ice. It's not uncommon to find dwarven children playing naked in salt-ice baths, chilled well below freezing by the Cold but unfrozen due to the salt. Dwarves build settlements beside lakes where they mine the lake for mighty ice blocks turning a calm frozen lake into a massive ice quarry. <br><br>Dwarves are not a warlike or trading people. They manufacture simple and functional tools, wear simple clothes and value reliability and function over form. Their weapons tend to be adapted from their ice-mining tools. Dwarven foods are heavily salted which keeps them pliable but renders them almost inedible to humans. As a result, Dwarves are unfairly thought of as inhospitable.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Elves<br/>There are few records of the immortal fae-descended elves among the Servants of Death. It is known that when an Elf dies, his soul is immediately reborn. Of all the intelligent races, Elves are most at home in the Cold as they reflect their environment more than any race. In effect, they are elemental chameleons, as at home in the dead fields of the Cold as they are basking beside the rivers of lava among the People of the Mountain. <br/><br/>When encountered in the Cold, an elf will almost appear deathly frozen and indeed will always be the same temperature as his surroundings. In the warmth, their flesh will take on a reddish hue. Some claim the Cold was engineered by this Fey race as a method for them to conquer all the lands of this world. If this was the case, they have succeeded though individual Elves deny any knowledge of such a plan. <br/><br/>Human blood courses within their veins and they often interbreed with humans, producing offspring which have either the characteristics of one or other parent but seldom both. As a rule, they are helpful, slow to anger, and yet merciless with their foes. They can live among humans and dwarves but there is a long enmity between the Elves and the Servants of Death and the latter count few Elves among their number as a result. The Elves count their own histories on elaborated beaded tapestries, claiming descent from one Fae, a fair and benevolent Lady called Isaz.<br/><br/>Unknown to the Elves, Isaz lives still, as the cold and terrible Lady Aufeis - The Snowflake Queen, her heart as cold as the disaster she has unleashed upon the world.                        </div>

As I have gotten a few things along a different vein I offer to collate and get it into a format along the TOC comments made up above for my initial contribution. I did start doing a minor statting of the three main locations and will post those later today/weekend using the influienecs up above<br/>

Re: SnowFlake Queen: I'm not mad on the name but I don't intend her to be evil - just damaged. and not irretrievable. And her followers? Are they good? Bad? I see them as indifferent/neutral.<br/><br/>Re: Naga: Yeah, there's good and bad Naga but alignment isn't relevant really. I'm ignoring racial alignments especially. I think that all of the Naga in this world might be a shade of Lawful Good/Evil but survival is paramount and there's no reason they can't coexist. This dichotomy makes the Dark very attractive to me (never mind the opportunities for art showing hawt snake-women)<br/><br/>I'm just writing for the fun of it. If there's sections you'd like fleshed then point them out. I was going to give the SnowKnights a go a bit later.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas T</cite>The warmth from underground magma seems a nifty element, and I have an unreasonable love for "between a rock and a hard place".  What if you personified the heat of the earth?  It may provide respite from the cold of the surface, but its nature is hostile to the surface people.  Say that this world has a very active core (perhaps a direct link to the elemental plane of fire/magam?), hungry rivers of magma always reaching up to the surface.  Whole societies of fire-aspected creatures worshipping its divine (sentient?) power.  The arctic apocalypse has sent people hunting for heat sources and they've found this ancient hostile enemy.</blockquote>
I like this idea, because "what if" the world were opened to the opposite planes. Cold at the poles, Heat at the centre. Then you have the Cold being focussed around the Snowflake Queen and the Heat about to be channelled by what is left of the Magma Mages' mentors. It's pure metaplot but MP can be good.<br/><br/>It might not be her fault, the Cold "took" the SnowFlake Queen....and the Fire is taking the Wizards....eeek...Planar Celebrity Deathmatch!                        </div>

                            Nagas come in four varieties in D&amp;D: Dark (LE), Guardian (LG), Spirit (CE), and Water (N).

True dat! The response has been amazing. I can't keep up. Once we see what all ends up in the book, I'll revisit the layout, hopefully with help from the more artistic of us.<br><br>One thing that occurred to me was that ice ages sequester water as snow and ice buildup, causing the sealevel to drop. With the scale of Permafrost, we're talking probably hundreds of feet of change (I'm guessing here. I'll Google it to see for sure). That leaves room in the setting for places, creatures and things that have been uncovered by the dropping sea. In the equatorial regions, you might still have a lot of displaced water aspected guys.<br><br>Q                        </br></br></br></br></div>

The Wikipedia article mentions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29" rel="nofollow">a dozen types of Naga</a> and most of them are evil. I don't see Permafrost as having to be rigid to the "monster manual" rules and I really wouldn't worry about breaking the "usually" rule. If Johnny GM has a really serious problem with Guardian Nagas and Dark Nagas finding common ground then lets cater for that by having a sidebar about the secret civil war going on behind the scenes. So subtle and deadly that most of the cultists don't know it's going on! <br><br>End of the day it's all going to be about perspective (otherwise why would be enjoy the tale of 3 terrorists, 2 droids, a smuggler and his dog in "Star Wars: A New Hope!)<br/><br/>I'm looking at the Ecology now. Are you really going to have the world populated by every single race in the MM?

                            Ok, just make sure you don't refer to any of those other Nagas by name! The books in which they appear have little to no Open Gaming Content, making them 100% off-limits for us. I like the civil war sidebar idea a lot; let's do that.<br/><br/>As for the monster population, I would think that the <i>pre-disaster</i> world had all the standard Monster Manual stuff. These days a lot of them will have moved underground, gone extinct, or been converted into Frozen monsters (a la the Frozen template in Permafrost). With the "sentient cold" idea, one can explain away the conversion of existing monsters pretty easily.                        </div>

                            Hmm. I hear crickets. Ok, here's something from me, from the early days of the Crystalhome Adepts.<br/><br/>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/><br/>The wind blows. The water ripples. The fires flicker and dance. Other adepts sway with the freezing gale. In the meditation yard, Brother Uwen alone is unmoving.<br/><br/>The scene endures for a timeless instant.<br/><br/>The gong outside the monastery rings, jolting some of the monks from their meditation. Brother Kaibu walks towards the door as the others try to regain their postures and their calm. Brother Uwen remains motionless.<br/><br/>Kaibu opens the door. Outside are some peasants from down the hill. He can tell at a glance that they carry their lives on their backs - their packs are stuffed full, their mule is laden down, even their children bear burdens. Live chickens peck at the ground behind them, tied together on a long string like mountain climbers.<br/><br/>"Yes, honored travelers," says Kaibu, "what can I do for you?" He knows the answer. He has heard it from many others in the last year. Nonetheless, it is polite to ask.<br/><br/>"Y'all the Adepts, raht?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we are the Adepts of th-"<br/><br/>"We gota question for yew."<br/><br/>"If you are seeking lodging, I suggest the crystal villa in the valley. I understand they accept all-"<br/><br/>"No, no, we came from there. It's full-up."<br/><br/>Some of the monks crack an eye open and look at each other. Full? The ever-expanding crystalline town is... full? Brother Uwen remains motionless.<br/><br/>"Naw, we wants you to settle a dispute fer us."<br/><br/>"A dispute. Oh." Kaibu's brow furrows slightly. "Can you not ask the wizards who live there?"<br/><br/>"Nope."<br/><br/>"No?"<br/><br/>"One'a them's gone. Other one's all busy."<br/><br/>"Gone?"<br/><br/>"You gonna repeat everythin' I say, baldy?"<br/><br/>Kaibu is taken aback. Not by being called "baldy;" how others see his hair or lack thereof is not a concern to him. No, it is the loss of the wizard that captures his attention. This will be brought up at dinner tonight. Some of the monks come out of their stances and look towards the door, and Kaibu thinks, <i>or perhaps before dinner. Perhaps right now.</i><br/><br/>"Well, I cannot say that we have much experience in settling other's arguments..."<br/><br/>The man's wife speaks up. "Please. We ain't got no other authority to talk to. We need yer help."<br/><br/>Kaibu sighs. "Very well. I will come to your home tomorrow and speak with you about this." He learned from them where they lived - on a set of stairs in the villa, as it turned out, gods above, how did they live in such a way? - and promised his presence in the early morning. The villagers, barely satisfied, began the ever-shorter trek down the hill towards the crystalline town. Kaibu closed the door. Uwen meditated.<br/><br/>Conversation began with koans, quickly turned into proverbs, and moved from there into genuine debate. Kaibu was a senior student, but a student nonetheless, and he watched and learned as the masters twisted words and ideas around. Isolation was near to sacred for these people, as was cleanliness, and going into town meant a lack of both. There was the law of Crystalhome to consider as well; the monks were not well-versed in the regulations and decrees of that place, and helping would mean taking time away from their studies to learn. Soon there would be scores of peasants clamoring for assistance of one kind or another; the situation demanded a response. <br/><br/>"We are being called forth."<br/><br/>Brother Uwen had spoken, and all were quiet.<br/><br/>"We are becoming part of the world. We will move there and help, or we will stay here and freeze. There is no desire, there is only truth."<br/><br/>And thus the adepts came to Crystalhome, where they met Laccia and learned of her love for her husband and for the world.                        </div>

                            If you're ok with the idea of giving the otherplanar cold an identity (not to be confused with a personality) how about "the marching cold" as a name for it?  It sounds appropriately ominous and works with another idea I had.<br/><br/>Glaciers are cool (no pun intended).  Say that there's massive, huge, brobdingnagian glaciers creeping across the world.  Skyscraper-tall shelves of otherworldy ice, spreading out from the mysterious epicentre of The Big Disaster.  The idea being that yes, the world's fallen into an ice age and that's terrible, but that's relatively mundane.  Those glaciers would mark the territory of the otherworldy cold that <i>caused</i> the ice age.  With the marching cold's spawn live in the glaceirs' shadow.  And sure, people are managing to survive in this new ice age, but those glaciers are the end of the world. and they're always coming closer.<br/><br/>I figure that gives you a nice sense of inevitability; no matter how well people manage to adapt to a mundane ice age the real deal is just around the corner.  And it's creeping closer and closer; shrinking the world.  And then you've got a specific place to say "that's where the various frostspawn creatures <i>of</i> that cold come from".  And a thing to point to and identify with the force behind the ice age.                        </div>

                            Thomas,<br/>Good point! The inevitable glacier idea works well with reports from the Little Ice Age with how people dealt with the ever-encroaching glaciers in europe (like bishops praying before glaciers about to crush a town). Plus, ice ages have lots of glaciers, so we can't really avoid them. Why not personify them for some excellent setting fodder?                        </div>

                            Hmm. Not a bad start. I'm not sure we need a whole-planet map for a game where most of the action would be confined to a thousand-mile radius, but I appreciate the help.<br/><br/>Do you have a version withou the latitude/longitude lines? They look suspiciously pixelated, and I can put those kinds of things in with Photoshop, with finer detail (as well as cleaning up the coloring, putting perfect circles around the edges, etc). <br/><br/>The bay in the center of the right-hand map (northern coast of middle continent) looks like a good location for the game. It's about 500 miles wide, assuming an Earth-sized planet, which gives us plenty of space. We could use one of the equatorial islands on the left-hand map, but it's hard to explain how people would come from the south to that point without a lot of ice-fishing.                        </div>

Hey now, don't step on my creative process 9^&gt;   Seriously, though, I tend to think in planets, which can be a drawback for FRP settings, which tend to be isolationist. My goal was to represent a few ideas of landmass morphology to see what people liked.

So, I think I see what you like and I'll play around with the map a bit. I have had success removing the long/lat lines, but discovered some coolness in PaintShop Pro that I hadn't played with before. I'll repost soon. BTW, the long/lat lines are pixelated, from a crude map in global projection I was able to find. I printed it as a transparent layer, so I'd have something to work with, but I think I should have printed it fainter. I'm working on a smoothed out version for my own edification.                        </div>

Heh, heh, heh. Cool ain't it? <br/>Seriously, though, you'll see that the world map has coastlines with varying degrees of wavyness. I like the Fjordy look, but it doesn't really work for a whole continent. I can just do sections, btw, but chose not to. If you like something you see there, or something is close, let me know. Contraiwise, if you just like the original, say so. Finally, if you like aspects of the original, but want changes, holler. We can dispense with the world map, and take any coastline you like, blow it up and call it tropical. Likewise, we can scrap the map, entirely. Just thought folks would like some spatial orientation to hang their thoughts on.<br/><br/>In my attempts to remove the faint long/lat lines without simply painting them over white, the original pencil-sketch look was lost. If you prefer the pencil sketch look to the more terrainlike look, I'll try again.<br/><br/>Q                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Colin</cite>the people in the north started moving south. They went a little farther each time, hoping it would all just stop so they could live their lives. Five years ago the northerners finally traveled so far south that <i>they ran into the people who had been moving north</i>. The whole world is in the worst ice age you can imagine â€” the equatorâ€™s frozen and the poles are wide-open portals to the paraelemental plane of Ice. </blockquote>
How'd I miss that for so long? But, now to belabor a fine point â€” is the ocean frozen over at the equator, or is it just the land that is icy? (As the poles creeped down, the ocean would have gotten <i>really </i>salty, making it harder to freeze.) Just trying to wrap my mind around the monumental coldness.                        </div>

                            The ocean should be, at the very least, clogged with icebergs. Ocean water freezes just a few degrees below 0 C, and even the Great Salt Lake would freeze around -15 C. We had whole weeks that cold up in Troy. The setting for Permafrost is basically year-round New England winter, though obviously not this year's - goddamn 65 degrees today...<br/><br/>I think the original large-scale map looks better than the distorted version.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite>&lt;//img&gt; Some people might complain about the colored pencil work, but it doesn't bother me. </blockquote>
Heh. To be honest it <i>does </i>bother me a little. A bit too novice-y, but my art skills have atrophied. Actually, I was impressed with how well I did having not picked up a colored pencil in goodness knows how long. In some ways it gives it a homey feel, like a map sketched by your great grandfather and passed down. I'm definitely not happy with the water background. Too CGI for the feel of the land. I think that increases the incongruity. I want to do a pencil water effect, scan it, and apply it as the background and see how that works. In the absence of anything better (hint, hint, folks) I think it works well for free art.<br/><br/>After that, I need to figure out how to make it look snowed on! Right now I'm stumped.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite>&lt;//img&gt;I figure we'll put the Smoking Mountain on the peninsula on the inset map, and Crystalhome in the foothills of the central mountains (left-hand side of the inset).</blockquote>
You know, that's about what I was thinking. Didn't seem right for Smoking Mountain (wait, wasn't that Steaming Mountain before?) to be over in the foothills. Unless, of course, they were volcanic mountains. I was sort of thinking of them as tectonically formed, with the north east side subducting beneath the southwest side.                        </div>

                            Tell me about it. I was doing job interviews in California last week, one a day. I swear it felt like three weeks.<br/><br/>I'm still playing with the map a little. Let's move on to some other stuff; we've been stuck on this for too long. How about some somewhat more detailed adventure ideas?

                            Let's say your team finds out that the conjunction is temporary - another five years and it'll start getting better, but sometime during those five years the Prime will actually pass <i>through</i> the paraplane of Ice. They decide that retreating into the Great Dark to wait it out is the best option.<br/><br/><b>Suggested Party Composition:</b> Having a Core Seeker and at least one underworlder (either a Naga Cultist or a Servant of Death) will be essential for navigating the Great Dark both physically and socially. You'll also need someone who can convince the upworlders that they'll be safer underground.<br/><br/><b>Major Challenges:</b> The overworld population is large, and finding a suitable place to put them all will almost certainly require displacing an existing group. The Nagas will be glad to help point out groups that "need displacing" from their point of view, and it will be a challenge to make a home in the Great Dark without becoming someone's thrall or making major enemies. In short, this kind of campaign is equivalent to having to clear the largest dungeon in the world for at least ten levels straight down and miles out to the side.<br/><br/><b>Twists:</b> There <i>are</i> areas suitable for habitation that are not currently occupied, but this is thanks to some of the powerful undead monsters lurking in the Dark. There are mummies, liches, and worse down here, plus vampires who haven't tasted human blood in thousands of years. Many of them have class levels: old classes, SRD classes, with powers and abilities that don't exist in the Permafrost base classes. The core rules have good examples of such monsters already fully statted out. (If not for the fact that Beholders are considered Product Identity by WotC, I would totally put a giant hive of beholder-kin in the depths. Damn you, you eleven-eyed freaks!)<br/><br/>What else should go in these blurbs? Am I listing stuff that's too obvious?                        </div>

                            So, I was thinking about druids and trees while I was clearing snow off the driveway for the second time today. All the cold hardy trees live up north, so at the lattitude of CrystalHome et al. they would die off, freezing and cracking and all that unpleasantness. It would take a little time though, so imagine the plight of the druids who were especially attuned to plant life. What would they have done as the cold creeped south?<br/><br/>I imagine some would have become Johnny-Appleseeds, transporting and transplanting the cold hardy trees southward, trying to keep ahead of the glaciation. At some point this may have become a vain effort. I don't know what temperatures are typical in the Taiga biome up in Canada and Siberia (but a quick google should solve that issue â€” Ah. Here we are, from blueplanetbiomes.org: The winter temperature range is -54 to -1Â° C (-65 to 30Â° F). Temperature range in the summer gets as low as -7Â° C (20Â° F). The high in summer can be 21Â° C (70Â° F).). So, yeah. Even those evergreens would have died off by the time of the current setting which is harsher than Tundra climate (The average winter temperature is -34Â° C (-30Â° F), but the average summer temperature is 3-12Â° C (37-54Â° F) according to ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/tundra.php). I believe Colin was thinking Summers would rarely get far above freezing, say capped at 40Â°F? And Winters would be very deadly.<br/><br/>So, seeing that even the hardier trees were doomed, some druids might have turned to science (also encouraged by the loss of contact with their deities), following in Mendeleev's footsteps and trying to breed hardier trees. They may have even switched to studying arcane magic to make magically enhanced trees. What Permafrost classes would these ex-druids have drifted into? Definitely they would have to partner with Magma Mages, going around making small volcanic vents and planting trees in the defrosted soil around them.<br/><br/>The animal-friend druids would have had similar problems shepherding their charges, but at least they could walk on their own.<br/><br/>And what of the Dryads who perished with their trees? The SnowKnights found their fey goddess to power their magic. What if some druids were able to find a way to become vessels for dryads or nyads? What benefits and drawbacks might that entail? One drawback might be a shortened lifespan, as the housing is very draining on the vessel. Any other ideas? Or does this delve into unwanted territory?<br/><br/>Anyway, that's all for now. Gotta go clear the driveway again. Brrrr.<br/><br/>SlaintÃ¨,<br/>Q                        </div>

I don't think this stuff is too obvious. Hard to say, since it works logically, what parts I would or wouldn't have thought of on my own. Then again, I don't spontaneously generate plot seeds very well, and that is more like a small bush than a seed. <br/>As a suggested campaing direction, I think it's got just enough detail. It's also something that you could turn into a major campaign to sell as a supplement, if you were feeling masochistic.<br/><br/>Along the same vein, you could have an adventure where some folks board ship for the few months the ocean isn't frozen over in search for other lands. Maybe they'd find a Hawaii or something? Or something uncovered by the retreating sea level.<br/><br/>Q                        </div>

                            So I've incorporated a lot of the fluff-type ideas people had from earlier in this thread, found some public domain artwork for the book, shuffled things around a little, and put together a (hopefully) improved version. You can take a look at it <a href="http://www.valentgames.com/download/PermafrostPre.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you like; it's about 50 pages and 3.1 MB. This is pre-editing, so if you notice any typos or inconsistencies, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>My big question is this: does this revision actually address the complaints that previous reviewers had, or did I just add material without really doing what people suggested?                        </div>

                            Okay, I'm liking that a lot. I do think there needs to be a SPOILER from you on the relationship between the cold and the snowflake queen and where the paladin-like knights of the snows fit in. I had some ideas but it seems very much like stepping on your toes.<br/><br/>Without that metaplot bit, I think it's still lacking!                        </div>

                            Thanks, Matt. That's a good point about the spoiler notice; perhaps some things (or just that one) should go near the end of the book instead of at the beginning.<br/><br/>I think that rather than directly answer the KotS / Snowflake Queen question, I'd prefer to put in several different alternatives the DM could choose from.

I was just about to suggest that myself.<br/><br/>I'm still reading, but one initial impression is that the fluff seems dumped. We should consider different ways of presenting it. If you want it together, maybe a separate chapter layout for it. Otherwise, they may work nicely in running side bars, perhaps set apart the way you had Console: Legends layed out a while back.<br/><br/>Oh, and, just glancing over at my notes. Where are the entrances to the Dark? Scattered in the wilderness? Clustered under Mountain and Home? Something more logical? <br/><br/>That's all for now.<br/><br/>Q                        </div>

                            No, it didn't.<br/><br/>In the end, I decided it wasn't worth it and concentrated on things like Sufficiently Advanced instead. This has paid off in spades (if not necessarily in cash).                        </div>

                            Fair enough. I bought Sufficiently Advanced, as it happens (I'm not a d20/D&amp;D player so Permafrost wasn't my market)                        </div>
