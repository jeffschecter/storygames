                    This morning I realized I'm working on four or five different games, and none of them have a GM.  That's just how they roll - I <em>love</em> GMing myself, way more than I love playing, and on some level I want to spread that love around.  -1 GM = +1 player, which is also math I appreciate.  I constantly question the utility of a GM in every game I play and every design I work on.  It's the first question I ask people about their games-in-progress.  <br/><br/>In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=203&amp;page=1#Item_22" rel="nofollow">another thread</a> Tony talked about appreciating and respecting tradition as a design element, and I get that.  I'm not setting out to be a fancy pants auteur!  So sell me on the GM role - why it is awesome, why it is necessary, why it works.                </div>

                            For me, GMing has two distinct rewards, one for the GM and one for the players. The latter is the one I want to talk most about, though. In my group, folks pretty much all lives with some major elements of suck in them, whether it's chronic illness, death making the family rounds, or other stresses. Furthermore, we nearly all have experience writing professionally on gaming and related subjects, so we're familiar with coordinating the exercise of authority and all that. For us, the chance to set such concerns aside, and slide into a role and be someone else for a while, is a genuine escape - it's fun, we like it, we often do it very well.<br/><br/>When this is a thing the players seek, the GM is the one who provides the service of a world for the alter egos to deal with. One participant refrains from diving deep so as to help the others go deeper, basically. <br/><br/>I know that there are all too many GMs whose concern is with dragging the PCs through this neat plot or that cool setting, and I see the effort to challenge it as the automatic assumption as very healthy. But this other aspect, of GM as supporter of player wishes, is easy to overlook precisely because it's not very flashy.                        </div>

                            Is it possible to explain any possible feature of the GM without a specific game attached?  I mean, I can point to specific games and talk about why the GM is useful or not in that specific game, but I can't think of anything at all in the grand scheme of things.<br/>
<br/>
So, my official answer is;  Depends on the game.  <br/>

But that answer sucks.<br/>

                            Eric, that is the only accurate answer.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to a great many illuminating, interesting, and inaccurate generalizations, though ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Mine included:  The best reason to have a GM is social.  It appoints someone as the guy who organizes the game, takes responsibility for knowing all the rules, coordinates the social activity at the game (ordering food, etc.) and so on.<br/>
<br/>
A great reason to have player role division (note: not necessarily a GM, but a lot of GMless games lack player role division.  Universalis, Capes, and Falling Leaves all have no role division.  Polaris, Breaking the Ice, and PTA lack a standard GM, but have role division) is that it avoids the situation where no one does anything, either because no one wants to take responsibility, or because lots of people have good ideas but aren't throwing them out for fear of stepping on other people's toes.  Saying "you, right now, do this!" is a great way to get people moving.  Polaris, in particular, relies on this to jumpstart the game.<br/>

                            Bruce, your example of GMing as self-sacrifice is one I've heard before for sure, and even experienced myself.  The question it brings to mind is - if this facet of the role is compassionate, why not share the burden and ask everyone to be compassionate?                        </div>

                            Ben, same question - why does the social burden fall on one person?  Is it just more comfortable for us monkeys to operate in a heirarchy?  <br/><br/>I'm all about dividing up roles and sharing responsibility.  I dislike playing with people who aren't willing to take some ownership of their own fun, and a passive player is doing just that in my mind.  Having a GM facilitates this, right?  <br/><br/>I think my own prejudices maybe blurring my perception, which is why I started the topic.                        </div>

                            Ben - (thinking very traditionally) The GM assumes the burden of playing myriad shallow characters so that everyone else can play detailed, deep, thought-out characters.  They even have names to separate them from the riff-raff - player characters.  The GM doesn't get one.  He sacrifices one kind of fun, admittedly for another.                        </div>

                            My problem with the burdens and such falling on one person is that all too often it is about power.  That one person get's to decide what the group players or some such bullshit because they are the ones who labor to create the adventure or make the dip or dial the phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
When someone takes on all of the burden, I'm wary.  If its just good ole fashioned self-sacrifice and hard work for the greater good, awesome and thank ye kindly.<br/>

But if its passive aggressive bullshit...my EYE is on you...whoever you is.  I'm just talking out my butt-hole based on past experiences I've had at the table and responses I've gotten around different online communities.                        </div>

                            IMHO, the best thing a GM can do is provide continuous adversity. I.e., contrary to Capes where it's all versus all and each one is focused mostly on their own agenda, in a more traditional game, the GM can plan and scheme and alter the adversity over a longer stretch of time. Sorcerer fits into this model as well; the GM can continue to push and focus on doing just that.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that Polaris works well in that way too, even though GM roles rotate, because any given player's GM remains consistent. That means that the "GM" can plan ahead and provide continuous adversity for that particular Heart.                        </div>

<p>Oh, Jason.  I think you misread me.  I wasn't talking about the content of play at all.</p>
<p>I was saying that it's very useful for there be a coordinator of the game <em>as a social activity</em> (organizing timing, food, hosting, everyone knowing the rules to some extent, etc.)  Traditionally, the GM role in game rules also provides this very necessary social role.</p>
<p>It's not a great positive, I admit.  Judd points out that it can be used as a weapon.  But it's the first one that comes off my head, namely 'cause the lack of it is a big problem for some Polaris groups getting together.</p>

                            Jason: I regard developing and playing a character well as owning one's share of the fun. In my group, at least, it's not incompatible with a lot of kibbitzing about how to handle uncertain situations, or with contributing to the environment. Someone on RPG Net had a good example recently, of a player saying "Well, I go to the wharf..." and the GM answering, "Tell me about the wharf," and the player doing just that. I get a lot of that in my games in recent years - the players happily hand off the background and antagonists and equally happily dive in to give me back foreground, complications, all kinds of color.                        </div>

I get you but don't agree entirely.  <br/><br/>Eric - Being a GM means exercising more than your share of creative control, playing tons of characters, and pushing people's buttons to drive the game in exciting directions.  I think the best way to author a GM role that forces players to be active is to make the players GMs.  I love being a GM and I want everybody to have that feeling.  Why hoard it at the table (barring group consensus and dynamics, as Bruce mentioned)?  Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            Jason, I'm not sure I agree about creative control in conventional GM arrangements. It depends on how you weight the part of the characters. This is something authors of fiction dicker over endlessly, actually - how do you tally up the factors that add up to significance? It's not just presence on the page/screen, or scheming masterminds would seldom be important. Narrative vantage isn't reliably it, either - Watson is important, but most sidekick narrators aren't, for instance. It's not...well, it's not - or not necessarily, or reliably - anything you can point to. It's just that some characters end up having a weight, a "reality", greater than a whole lot of the stuff around them, and not always the weight the author intended to put on them.<br/>
<br/>
This is just by way of noting that sometimes really different distributions of power as an outside observer would see them can end up meaning much the same to the different participants.                        </div>

<p><code>Does that make sense?</code></p>
<p>Sure does.  Except that I think you're still making assumptions about the GM's role in the game that could use some breaking.</p>
<p>On the other hand, accepting all those assumptions as rule for the moment, then you're right; the best way to author a GM role to bring out player activity is to present everyone with the responsibilities of GM.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if your question hasn't been answered yet.  If you're asking what kind of coolness a GM role could present in your game, then it's either been answered (none?) or we need to drop those assumptions.  If, on the other hand, you're asking why any game would need a GM, I think that's been answered too.  It depends on the game.</p>

Also, I have a tendency to read more into what people are saying than is really there.<br/>
<br/>
What you seem to be saying, is that players in the groups you've played with, including yourself, prefer Actor or Author stance to Director stance, because Director stance tends to get in the way of "deep engagement" (by which I read "immersion").  By putting all of the "Director" eggs in the GM's basket, everyone else can "get into character."<br/>

<p>One of the benefits of the GM is that it lets you do a lot of things by a <em>very, very</em> simple system:  the GM says "Yes" or the GM says "Uh ... hold on a second."  This means that the GM has a <strong>lot</strong> of power to insert quick, fun, mostly trivial things to just keep the world seeming real and twisty and exciting.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Player:  "I hit the orc in the head with the half-filled stein of beer!"</p>
<p>GM:  "The orc's skull is very thick.  It turns around angrily, then sees your weapon.  'BEER!  T'ANK-YEW!'  It grabs the beer, takes a big swig and leaps to rejoin the brawl."</p>
<p>Player:  "Phew!  Lucked out on that one!"</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Can</em> that happen without a GM?  Sure.  But having a GM is a really good tool toward making it happen.  It makes it easy.  And it makes it particularly easy for groups that have practiced that particular comfortable dynamic for years and years.</p>

                            Pretty much, I think, Vaxalon. Setting aside all the nits, yes, my folks like to approach their characters with priority given to that character's experience of the world. They're not all immersive players, but they all like that focus. So it's convenient for us to move the stuff less compatible with it to the GM. (Or, in some cases, to players whose characters aren't in this scene or session.)                        </div>

                            Tony touches on something very important, too: comfort. I think that all of us who go off and dabble with experiments are prone to underestimating its importance to a lot of gamers. Given how many folks do game for escape and essentially light fun, the neophile's fascination with stuff that is different without really being hugely better (or worse) for the task at hand can really muck things up. This is something we started dealing explicitly with in the revised-era Storyteller's guides at White Wolf, finding out when experiments and variations would be welcome and when they wouldn't be, for folks playing those particular games. I seem to recall reading a really good discussion of alternative mechanics in some other mainstream game a year or so ago, but can't now remember what.<br/>

It'd be interesting but probably a pain and a half to work out a shared-control game with a sliding scale of sharing.                        </div>

<b>Jason Morningstar</b> wrote...<br/><i>So sell me on the GM role - why it is awesome, why it is necessary, why it works.</i><br/><br/>As for the middle part, a GM isn't necessary in the slightest -- provably so.  (That strikes me as a troll line, by the way.)  As for why it's awesome, there are as people said many different reasons depending on the game.  <br/><br/>I'll give one from one of my games:  At the start of a pulp game, I roll out a map and say "We last left our heroes desperately driving down the runway in Indonesia to their plane, their jeep on fire, firing away at the dozen cars behind all after the secret plans in the puzzle box they're carrying."  Immediately all the players grabbed that and ran with it, making their heroes doing even more cool things in their escape.  By having the authority to say that, I could get things going for <i>all</i> the players at a thrilling pace in ten seconds flat.                        </div>

                            I think it's more useful to talk about the duties a GM typically has and how to get them. Not all games give the GM the same responsibilities and powers.<br/>
<br/>
A GM can provide:<br/>
<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A living room to play in<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Opposition in the form of antagonists and world factors<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Snacks<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A coherent set of problems for the players to address<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Refereeing<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Arbitration of player disputes<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A veto on player actions<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Coordination of player goals<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A story<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Music for the game soundtrack<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Decision on the outcome of tasks<br/>
<br/>
You can divide these responsibilities up into groups, I think:<br/>
<br/>
1. Social coordination<br/>
2. Social Arbitration<br/>
3. Game Arbitration<br/>
4. Opposition<br/>
5. Storyteller<br/>
<br/>
3. and 4. represent a conflict of interest, and as such should be divided up into different sources. Ideally, the rules deal with game arbitration. If the rules for opposition are concrete enough, anyone can play the opposition, given that the other responsibilities they have don't constitute a conflict of interest.<br/>
<br/>
1. and 2. can be anybody with a vested interest in making the game a good experience.<br/>
<br/>
5. is in direct conflict with the players doing anything significant and should probably be ditched as a GM responsibility altogether.<br/>
<br/>
What responsibilities am I missing?                        </div>

                            This is tangential, but I'm wondering, in cases like Bruce's where the players want to get really immersed, how does the GM figure out what the characters want? Do you kinda have to feel your way at first until you get a handle on the characters? Do you discuss it between game sessions via email and stuff?                        </div>

                            For my games, the primary service a GM provides is moderating pacing. Which often means pushing towards conflict and scaling stakes up or down.                        </div>

                            Matt: The players tell you what they want when they build their characters.<br/>
<br/>
In a game like 9w it's easy, because you have the muses to guide you, but even in a game like Dungeons and Dragons there are flags.<br/>
<br/>
When a ranger takes dragons as a favored enemy, that means he wants to hunt dragons.  I'm sure you can make long lists of these things based on character builds.<br/>
<br/>
It's a useful exercise to gather up the character sheets before play, and take as many elements off the sheets as you can, and write down hooks for them.<br/>
<br/>
You have to be careful, though; occasionally you'll get something like what happened with Okhfels Mike Holmes' thursday night IRC HQ game.  I put a "resist mind control" attribute on him, and kept raising it every opportunity I got.  Why?  Because I did *not* want him to get mind-controlled, body-switched, etc. etc.  (It's a personal thing)  and I wanted to have mechanical support for that dislike.                        </div>

                            One of the things I'm envying right now about gm'd games it that they provide freedom from conflict of interest for shelling out adversity. If it's always and just one person's job to make the other peoples' (character's) lives miserable, it takes a lot of social figuring out of my job as a designer.  <br/><br/>Also you get to write a very different set of rules if you use the body of knowledge out there built up &amp; passed on about how to do all the many things that go into gming. <br/><br/>So the question is:  what are the gains from putting lots of the tasks Joshua listed into one set of hands?  We know that they can all be done by any group of any people--or is that an unquestioned assumption?--so what are the specific advantages of having just one do any set?<br/><br/>Reduction of conflicts of interest is my reason.  Focus on a given task has been mentioned. Tradition &amp; familiarity.  Oh, here's another one, we don't know how to do it yet. : ) Well, not really, but it's less charted waters. At least until you look at any board or card game, that is. : )                        </div>

Creating/revealing hidden information (like towns in Dogs or R-Maps in Sorcerer etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Insuring that all players have spotlight time<br/>

In many groups, the GM is the person who buys the book and learns the rules (or writes them), and teaches the rest of the group                        </div>

                            For me I GM nearly ever game I utilize. That gives me a perspective that says "Hey I like my role" sure I'd like to be a player, but I don't want to remove my role, merely pass it onto someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Now the basic question is "why do I feel this way?"<br/>
<br/>
Couple reasons:<br/>
<br/>
Consistency. I like consistency in play, the kind that comes from someone basically have a yea/nay vote over certian aspects or elements of play, whether they are player initiated, set props fro the setting, or what have you. To me it makes the game take on a reliable feel. Much like having a favorite author. I can read any fantasy, espionage, romance book--but I want to read certian authors who write those genres because of the quality, and consistency they create with the same (roughly) tools.<br/>
<br/>
I like revealed information, I liked having a sense of wonder when something happens, when a character steps out and sees (and I as a player visualize) something--whether it is a supervillain stepping from the shadows to reveal his plan in mocking dulcet tones, or a castle shining in the distance, the last hopeful bastion of light in a world of hoary shadow that weigh upon men's souls. That reveal matters to me, it feels exciting, interesting, and from feedback as a GM my players tend to enjoy it as well.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts.                        </div>

Do you think that you like revealed information by itself, or you like revealed information that is part of a setting which is assumed to exist regardless of its being revealed in play?  In other words, do you like that stuff being revealed because you "found" it in the midst of all the other imaginary details that may or may not get mentioned, or do you just like new stuff being thrown at you?<br/>
<br/>
Cause, technically speaking, you hardly need a GM for the latter.                        </div>

                            A GM provides for me:<br/>
1. Pacing. I can play immersed and not have to work about pacing or developing the plot in a non-organic fashion.<br/>
<br/>
2. Vision. The GM may have some startling ideas and intense situation that, due to prep, is deep and vibrant. I consider this "the GM's story" even if (especially if) there is no pre-planned anything, simply situation and background. <br/>
<br/>
With the GMs I enjoy playing with, the content of this setting (the meat with which the players interact) is exciting in a similar sense to getting a book from one of my favorite authors.<br/>
<br/>
3. Provides adversity within a cooperative structure. You don't have to play against other players. You may not even be playing against the GM--but there can be plenty of adversity--shattering adversity.<br/>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Someone just provided me with insight into why we need a GM, they said:<br/>
<br/>
"The game is about putting control of a setting in the players hands<br/>
The primary job of the players is to explore the world that has opened up to their characters."<br/>
<br/>
  Now on first blush, there isn't an RPG gamer that doesn't dig both of those two statemnts...<br/>
  However, these can very easily end up being polar opposites. i.e., I want to explore the setting that I control. I want to see what the setting I control has to offer, push the boundries of the setting I control in new and unique ways.<br/>
  See the problem? If you have to ask yourself for permission to explore, then it's not that exciting.<br/>
  Look at it this way. Do you get the same thrill when you look through your own medicine cabinet that you do when you look in someone elses? Why is that? Don't get me wrong, you own medicine cabinet can still surprise you and it is still useful, but exciting...<br/>
<br/>
  That's what a GM does, they provide that element of exploration, excitement and wonder.<br/>
<br/>
  If your game is about exploring relationships between characters, you can achieve both of those above statements easily and often. But if it is about exploring setting, you have a dilemna...<br/>

I prefer it be information that's reveale  to fit consistent vision--that doesn't come from "any input is viable" in my experience. Anyone "revealing" new info can be neat, but it tends to lack an internal connection to other reveals/other information.<br/>
<br/>
You ever read superhero comic books? You know how they may have a character do things differently from writer to writer? They are all representing the same character at its core (usually*). It becomes jarring to me when two people writing the same character write them very differently--it looses cohesion/continuity and the overall tapestry of their existence is lessoned. There  is a trend when any input is viable to the discovery/reveal for similar creeping inconsistencies--simply because the person in a given input, is not considering the same things as the established one. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Some writers make a whole point of retconning everything, rewriting the character so utterly as to change all that may have interested you in them in the first place (or perhaps making them interesting) but there is a reason a lot of fans tend to prefer certian writers for certian properties.                        </div>
