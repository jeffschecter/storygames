Normally, when my group runs a Microscope, I'll write the play report in the style of someone going through fragmented historical documents, maybe even having translation issues, or otherwise merely telling what history is known, accepting the blank patches. I noticed that Union seems a little harder to write up, and we didn't fill out all the cards (we only had time for two lenses), but I figured I might share it anyway, because it's new.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>An expedition to the peak of the tallest mountain, to slay the dragon who was the leader of a cult. Only one survived. His name was Max Pepsi.<br/><br/>He would not have been able to accomplish his heroic deed, had he not great resistance to the elements, such as the cold and low oxygen, a loose sense of ethics, that he might consume fallen expedition members, and great puzzle-solving skills, put to use when he tricked the dragon into causing their own demise.<br/><br/>But do heroes simply emerge like that? Where did he come from?<br/><br/>We know little of his parents. He claims his father was an apprentice chef called Diet Pepsi. He worked for a Lord or Baron or someone equally wealthy, but who has since lost his former land, money, and significance. It is too hard to verify with the limited documents on the subject. Max further claims his mother is none other than Princess Fanta, who was slated to marry said lord, but then disappeared from the records. Max claims it has to do with her secret affair with Diet, but we have no way of knowing.<br/><br/>On his Father, Diet Pepsi's side, we have Daniel Pepsi and San Pelegrina. Daniel was a half-dragon bodyguard; son to Midori Splice, who was famous in her time for stringing along human males with a... certain fetish, sleeping with them, and then disappearing. It may be worth mentioning at this point that dragons are about human-sized, and have similar intelligence. As a half-dragon, he was often outcast, but was very strong. He became a bodyguard more out of social necessity rather than choice. San, on the other hand, was the daughter of the royal cook. With a strong desire to follow in her father's footsteps, she disguised herself as a male in order to to become a cook herself. A kind lord who admired her resolve hired Daniel to protect her, and a bond slowly formed between Daniel and San. However, some time after the birth of Diet, San was discovered as female at a banquet by two guests: a foreign noble, whom she offended, and a dragon called Jack Daniel, who could smell her. She was subsequently executed, and Daniel went into depression and disappeared. With no family left, Diet was cared for by the head chef.<br/><br/>On Princess Fanta's side, we know that her own mother was Cherry Cola, born into royalty, and likely married to royalty, too. A product of her wealthy and powerful surroundings, it may come as a surprise to learn that Cherry's mother was part of a small tribe of natives to a distant part of the world. Even more surprising, that tribe was, in fact, part of the very cult to the dragon that Max would later slay! Her name was Jinx Lemon o'Bitter. It is clear through historical documents that she was kidnapped by the wealthy noble; Coke A'Cola. He mostly occupied his time in travelling, archaeology, and, while home, teaching. On one of his expeditions, he found an ancient tomb which contained a riddle that pointed him towards the tribe that Jinx was a part of. If Max got his puzzle-solving skills from anywhere, it was from A'Cola. After giving birth to Cherry, Jinx is strongly suspected of having killed her kidnapper, sacrificed to her own dragon cult. She maintained A'Cola's wealth and political power for herself, however, and Cherry's pampered future was secured.<br/><br/>We don't know who Cherry's partner was, beyond a brief mention that his mother was Ice Teresa, a woman who lived in the mountains selling ice. It is likely she came from a long line of mountain-dwelling folk who thrived in the cold and lower oxygen of the mountains. Again, Max would have her blood in his veins.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, if there's any further evidence of Max's ancestry, if he was even telling the truth, it's lost to the mists of time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435124/#Comment_435124" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T18:09:17+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  6:09PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You named all the characters after soda and booze?

We also filled in Coke A'Cola, the first Great-Grandparent, and Daniel Pepsi, the first Grandparent. Our first focus was one A'Cola's card. Immediately, we turned him into a kidnapper and an entitled rich arsehole. Interestingly, with four players, we were basically forced to have at least one scene, which covered how Cherry Cola learned about her Dad. I didn't include that in the above story, because we got confused about a vitally important detail to the question, and the scene fell apart.<br/><br/>It might be worth pointing out that I've never introduced the conflict-resolution mechanics to my Microscope players, because we seem to have done fine without. I should have introduced it here, but I forgot they existed. My bad. &lt;_&lt;<br/><br/>The first legacy introduced Ice Teresa, but we never came back to her. Then the next lens chose Daniel's card. That was great, because that card made the previously established apprenticeship of Diet's, which was light, have a much sadder history than we previously expected. We also finally worked out that dragons were human-sized, which allowed them to be involved in political affairs indoors, such as the banquet in which San was discovered. Finally, the legacy became Midori Splice, and we ended the game. That took three hours. Yeah, we're pretty slow.<br/><br/>We did generally find it restrictive to be confined to one card and its progeny, and, on the other hand, choosing a card for the focus was daunting and pretty arbitrary. We just chose cards that already had stuff. Then we had the challenge of connecting them. We had parents who we never found out the connection of, Great-Grandparents that we suddenly had to connect to royalty, in all it was pretty challenging. The wonderful connection that just happened to work to make Diet's story much more sad was great, but that was a rare moment. Mostly, it was bending and twisting to make the connection make sense. In the rules, it says that those above in the tree don't have to be blood-related, but in practise we found that almost impossible to actually have happen.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the limitations of trying to find links between parents, or between them and their child, put me in mind of how, in Microscope, you can't rely on any two periods or events being right next to each other for the whole game. This seems the exact opposite of that. Just an observation.<br/><br/>At the end, one of the players said that it really did feel like a game in the alpha stages. Still, we had a lot of fun, and to be fair, some of the people I play with are the kinds who try to break games. I expect the next game we play will be even harder to make sense of, just because we have an idea of what's going on now, and can push it further. I guess, where, in Microscope, you have a lot of power to just add stuff until a connection makes sense, whenever you want, here you have limited space and opportunity, and you have to think of the connection &lt;i&gt;now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435202/#Comment_435202" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T18:29:16+00:00" title="July 13, 2014  6:29PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2014 6:30PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to admit, I really can\u2019t figure out the tone of this game.

There was a lot more silly going on in scenes, too (some of us were fairly new to roleplaying). But other than that, the tone of the game as a whole was more serious, I think. The softdrink names were taken to be perfectly normal names in-universe that just happened to be names of drinks in our world.<br/><br/>I guess it's hard to tell how serious or silly it was, even for us. We were laughing and joking and getting distracted the whole time. Each of us in the group seem to have rather different things we're looking for in stories and in gaming. I do enjoy playing with them, but serious games with deep stories are few and far between (they exist, but then we get another new player (our group is pretty volatile), and it's gonna' be a few sessions before we even get a chance to be serious again). I'd like to see more seriousness, but it seems to be hard to find players who want that.\n<blockquote>When I playtest anything, I do my best not to treat it like a playtest. Just play normally.

And we did at least treat it like we do any other game. What I mean by breaking the game was more in the story than the mechanics (though perhaps that's hard to separate here). Some of us look for loopholes in the story to mess with, and in this game, there are more limitations, making it harder to make sense of a mess. It might just be my group again.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll have a more clear idea of my thoughts on the game after another play or two.

The fiction was satisfying in the end but only just, and I consider it more a mismatch of game and how much creative energy I had at the time than any specific fault in the game. I don't feel like I adequately played hence no AP report yet, next time I play I will be sure that I have the energy to do so.<br/><br/>I'm also certain that I did a poor job explaining scene framing which just meant that every scene involved a back and forth of correcting our process before we even got into a scene. As a result, most scenes just settled into being dictated scenes instead of roleplayed.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I misunderstood, but the Lens focuses on a particular union card instead of a particular piece of fiction, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435379/#Comment_435379" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-16T02:18:48+00:00" title="July 16, 2014  2:18AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not sure if I misunderstood, but the Lens focuses on a particular union card instead of a particular piece of fiction, right?</blockquote>\nExactly, just pick a card and build in it (or the offspring's life before their Union).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
