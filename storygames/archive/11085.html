I don't think anyone would disagree, though, that the format has been in decline for some time, though there might be conflicting ideas as to why.<br/><br/>But I put it to you as a simple thought experiment: if you <i>were</i> going to run a PBeM game, or if you were looking for a PBeM, what would you want to do?  And for the purposes of this discussion let's assume that PBP and PB-Wiki and PB-Wave are all part and parcel of the same thing: more or less turn-based gaming with a writerly bent.<br/><br/>As for me, I'm currently running a <i>Dune</i> game via PBP, but I keep looking for a similar game in which I could participate as a player.  <i>3:16</i> seems a prime candidate for PB-Wave, as FigureFour worked out a way to use the range map with little movable markers.  It was pretty cool.  And I wouldn't object to some good, old-fashioned western gaming the way the ol' prospector used to do it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince" title="Irishvince"><img alt="Irishvince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/464/n77MQHB4WLBHG.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince">Irishvince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246063/#Comment_246063" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T09:13:56+00:00" title="December 10, 2009  9:13AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If i ever was to try to PbeM again, I would like to play in a game where one Email is a big move (Caculated in months or years of game time ). <i>For example:</i>Some kind of Medieval game where every player control a fief or a kingdom and the Role play is mainly the letters or messengers going back and forth between the different kingdoms. (Maybe using something like <i>Birthright</i> or <i>Pendragon</i> or <i>Reign</i>)<br/><br/>You see the main problem I have with PbeM is how long it take to go through a scene of a regular RPG and how much it sucks when one player is slow to make his move. <br/><br/>So far the PB-Wave is way faster and more rewarding (I Gm in a <i>Donjon</i> game with players that are pretty fast wavers).

It is based on the book "The Defense of Jisr al Dorea". <br/><br/>In the last few years I've run spy games, Cthulhu horror stories, politica intrigues, and war games. <br/><br/>Engle Matrix Games make doing this easy because each turn player turn in an action that describes a whole scene. Others may jump in with counter-arguments and a referee sets to happen rolls and rolls the dice. The successful actions are then reported back to the players. It is very easy to do and doesn't require much tech savvy from the players. It is also very easy to make up new games on the fly and get going so the buy in for play is minimal. <br/><br/>Matrix Games are not in my mind technically role play games but they are definitely story games and they are perfectly suited for PBEM play.<br/><br/>If older methods for running PBEM are being killed by WOW that is not the case with Matrix Games. Nothing out there comes close to the freedom or ease of play they offer. Now if I could only monetize it...<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246080/#Comment_246080" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T10:38:19+00:00" title="December 10, 2009 10:38AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Chris on this one.

Unfortunately, I like the way the rules interact with the fiction and I feel the need to push to the end of the "session" before it dies out, so I'm not happy with just free-forming it.  If the "story" isn't advancing significantly with each post I feel like the game is one step closer to dying before it finishes.  So I'm willing to try anything that looks like it will work, especially if it's new, but my focus is on rules that are relatively light in play and don't require a whole lot of back-and-forth to resolve one thing.  Even Chronica Feudalis is proving a little slow with its "defensive" rolls, essentially doubling the length of a given conflict.<br/><br/>I'm still liking Solar System, though.  Most rolls that matter are just "vs" tests and done, usually resolving an entire scene, but there's still the option of extended conflict when it's needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nojh" title="Nojh"><img alt="Nojh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nojh">Nojh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246094/#Comment_246094" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T12:08:35+00:00" title="December 10, 2009 12:08PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games I've attempted to run:<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm attempting to run "side" scenes of my monthly 4th Ed D&amp;D Ebberon game over Google Wave right now.
