                    The game that I'm going to talk about actually happened almost a year ago.  I was reminded that I should write it up by the "Games, Kids, Smarts, School, and SES" thread, though I'm not sure how much this pertains to that discussion.<br/>
<br/>
A little background info:<br/>
<br/>
This happened at Mori no Ike, which is a Japanese language-learning camp in Minnesota.  This happened on the last night of camp.  The players come from the Asahikawa cabin, which was a group of 16 high school boys (one of them me) and two grown men (the counselors) who have lived in the same room for four weeks.  You don't end up at Japanese camp without becoming acquainted with geek culture at some point, so everyone knew what a roleplaying game was, and most of us had played one - DnD - at some point.<br/>
<br/>
On with the story.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in the cabin, someone had found a big, 2 inches on a side, blue die.  It being the last night, none of us intended to go to sleep.  Two guys were sitting on the floor, talking.  One picked up the blue die and rolled it.  It came up a 6.  He said "Ha!  I win!".  The other one said "No, I get a saving throw."  He got a six.  They started taking turns attacking and defending, and started narrating characters trying to kill each other (Godzilla and primordial ooze, if I remember correctly).  One by one, people joined in, until the whole cabin, half of the cabin next door, and the assistant dean were all cramped into our cabin in a circle around a blue die.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking back, I'm noticing some things.  I'll list them as they come to me.<br/>
<br/>
No GM, everybody had essentially the same input.<br/>
Very competetive, both in a "My character tries to kill your character" way, and in a "Who can come up with the coolest/funniest action" way.<br/>
The rules were never set down, or even explicitly agreed upon.  They just kind of happened.<br/>
We started with pretty concrete character ownership, but that broke down more the more we played.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what all that says about roleplaying, but I think there's something important buried in there about the Social Contract (to use a Forge term).  Anyone care to take a guess?                </div>

                            I'm not sure if there's anything deep that'll be found here, but a half a dozen nascentessays on the group construction of meaning (soc theory), some improv/calvinball (acting/game theory) bubble to mind.<br/><br/>Cool story though.<br/><br/>I had an experience where me, my best friend (who hadn't roleplayed much, but did some) and Toober were in a van going from Green Bay to Madison to hit the town and check out a rave.  On the way there, some three or four hours, Toober ran us through a game of "Shadowrun": We came up with character ideas and a nascent plot outline, and played the rest out from there, no papers pencils, numbers or dice rolls, for the rest of the trip, and the story ended just as we arrived.  Interesting to note that it was one of the coolest RPG experiences I ever had. <br/><br/>I wonder outside of "casting off the official rules, yet still following a sort of "system" that was based in simple acting rules" what my experience means, if anything is buried there.<br/><br/>... ... ... ... ... ... I'm curious if anyone else had sorts of "off the grid roleplaying experiences" that seem to say something important, but they're not sure what?  I don't want to overanalyze, but I'd really like to compare notes on experiences.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy, I had a similar experience on a 13-hour drive I went on with my brother.  When he was driving, I ran him through a series of adventures I had written for the game we were playing at the time*.  Nothing but my notes - no character sheet, no dice, no nothing.  It was very fun.  When I was driving, he went to sleep.  <br/><br/>*Stalking the Night Fantastic.  Confused ghost on an Air Force base, an animated prop from a Bela Lugosi movie, and a vampire on a motherfucking plane as I recall.                        </div>

                            Um, isn't this also called "freeform?" That's what I've always called it. <br/>
<br/>
Edit: What Andy and Jason are talking about, I mean. The initial post seems to discard character ownership, and is maybe something different.                        </div>
