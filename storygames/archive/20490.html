How do we summon that in a game?<br/><br/>Apart from all the other human insights that we try to work into our games, i think that this barf is always memorable experience for all present. It puzzles me that this is not a more discussed subject, since i think it makes for memorable moments.<br/><br/>I am trying to summon forth this very same barf of emotion in the system i am working on (ill make a thread about how i try to do that in the coming weeks, but for now, i think a discussion of the methods to do such will shed more light on the subject.)<br/><br/>It has always been important to me to implement such a \u201cfeeling\u201d as hard coded as possible into the mechanics, but by happenstance i think i uncovered something.<br/><br/>To create a barf of emotion, i think the game must have certain elements. Here are my ideas about the subject.<br/><br/>1. Tension - as in mechanical tension. <br/><br/>Examples: Using artha in "the burning wheel". And especially, dice explosion (6's giving you an extra die to roll, that may again explode.) This is primarily from the resource being scarce, and from the sometimes multiple rolls afterwards before finally achieving success or failure, focusing attention on the final roll as risk and tension rises. Do note this resource is gained by roleplaying your character, and this may also focus investment on the roll. This is from personal experience the time where the whole table yells \u201cYES\u201d as the last die allows you to succeed<br/><br/>2. Time/emotional-investment - stakes.<br/><br/>Examples: The final fight against a front in dungeon world, where the fate of something truly hangs in the balance. A fight where you have fought, lost and won multiple fights before it. I think the players being able to track what have already happened so far and what is at stake. would also help put the stakes into perspective.<br/><br/>3. Conflicting player emotions, and bleed between player and character emotions - emotional tension through immersion (through mechanics.). <br/><br/>Examples: This is, i think, the most important, and the most esoteric. I do not know which systems cause this the best. I have experienced pangs of it in \u201cthe mountain witch\u201d with the ai-uchi (opting for mutual success in a game of opposed, non-dependent stakes.) and in \u201cdogs in the vineyard\u201d when escalating would mean doing something nasty. <br/>Mechanics that ask you \u201care you willing to X to be able to Y?\u201d, systems designed for you to invest in the setting, and mechanics where you immerse yourself in the emotions of the character also foster conflicting emotions. An example would be "Utpost", where immersion is caused by a fruitful void between the friction meter, the contact rolls where you make your character vulnerable, and the relationship map you make at the start of the game.)All help facilitate this bleed and mixing of emotions, blurring the line between character and player choice.<br/><br/>4. Mechanical incentive vs emotions/goals.<br/><br/>Examples: the feeling of pain as you do something not mechanically sound, because it would hinder a goal coming to fruition, or increase risk, or maybe just because \u201cyour character would not do that.\u201d i think, amplifies the barf. I have seen people react  the opposite way  though: When mechanical incentive does not correlate with your characters emotions/goals, they are ripped out of immersion and they experience \u201caction paralysis\u201d at the same time.<br/><br/>5. sacrifices.<br/><br/>Examples: I think that when there is mechanical incentive to sacrifice or change something, and make yourself vulnerable, the barf becomes more fulfilling. Even more so, if the mechanical bonus may not cause a \u201cwin\u201d by default, but the things are lost none the less: sacrificing emotional bonds with other characters and NPC\u2019s, connections, ties to places, and even abilities as you try to succeed. If those have been built up over time, i think it will facilitate the barf even more. The vulnerability/secret in "Annalise" all are mechanics that tie either directly to emotionally important things, or are precious currencies you gain by engaging in your character. I have seen people experience conflicting emotions and deep sadness.<br/><br/>6. Denouement.<br/><br/>Examples: After the barf, there must be denouement, time where you can truly be thrown around as the barf stretches out time and the waves of pent-up emotion wash over you.<br/>I think that the roll/mechanic must be some form of conflict resolution, or knot-tying roll, so that after the roll, you have time to truly digest what has just passed. This is the element i am most unsure off.<br/><br/><br/>7. Aid mechanics.<br/><br/>Examples: The more people around the table that can invest themselves in the moment, the better: it will help crystallize the moment in time for everyone, and i think will facilitate an \u201call eyes on you\u201d/\u201dall eyes on the moment\u201d feeling\u201d. I guess that if the aid itself requires a sacrifice from the aider and has an element of mechanical tension in the aiding-mechanic, all the better.<br/><br/><br/>But most importantly, what do you think. Am i totally off the hook? What are your strongest experiences with these "barfs" - have you ever experienced them? What can these elements be in roleplaying games? Can you come up with other ideas how to facilitate the barf of emotion? <br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450314/#Comment_450314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T20:22:24+00:00" title="January  4, 2016  8:22PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2016 8:24PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some quick notes.<br/><br/>1. It's hard to talk about emotions and what they are but some scientists in the field believes they help us remember things. Being angry while doing something makes us more inclined to remember that particular event in the future.<br/><br/>2 a) If you want to become invested in an activity, it usually follows the same pattern.<blockquote><span style="color: blue;">Think -&gt; Action</span> -&gt; <span style="color: darkred;">Affect -&gt; Reaction</span> -&gt; <span style="color: purple;">Think</span> -&gt; ...</blockquote>\n<span style="color: blue;">You create a mental image of a plan and put it into action</span>, <span style="color: darkred;">you see how it affects the world and creates a reaction</span>, <span style="color: purple;">which makes you update your current mental image</span> for future actions.<br/><br/>2 b) Each time this circle happens, you learn something, and when you learn something dopamine is released in the brain. They are responsible of creating a feeling of joy.<br/><br/>3. Greg Costikyan said once that uncertainty is best if the solution isn't determined but also not totally random. Funny enough, Keith Burgeon says the same thing about decisions. From uncertainty comes <i>curiosity</i>, and from participation (which decisions are part of) comes <i>challenge</i>. When these two meet in the middle, where the solution isn't obvious and also not totally random, <i>tension</i> is created.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Point 2 and 3 can be used to create most emotions. Horror can come from the third, and the feeling of achievement can come from the second, only to give a notion of what I'm pointing at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3xJ" title="3xJ"><img alt="3xJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3xJ">3xJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450318/#Comment_450318" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T21:27:33+00:00" title="January  4, 2016  9:27PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2016 5:25PM by 3xJ.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see how the cycle helps facilitate learning.

Some people actually like a lot having the character as a shield for their emotions, thus they powergame to protect it. So, no wonder this isn't a more discussed subject. <br/><br/>That aside, there are a lot of games that are about eliciting emotions and are great at that. When I try to get at that, I learned that players love what they invest in as long as that investment pays them back without taking any fun from them. The payback doesn't have to bee too much for players to feel the investment was worth of it, but it certainly needs to be there. For example, players save a kid from a monster, as in "they killed a monster just because it was there and it turns out it had kidnapped a kid" (because otherwise players would only decide to save the kid mostly to remain in character/keep the immersion going). The kid turns out to be a nice cleric apprentice, can cast heal twice a day, stays out of trouble, isn't a burden to anybody, doesn't steal anybody's spotlight and contributes when needed, so players are happy to take him along the way. Now they have invested in this NPC without even noticing.<br/><br/>Next, you can use this investment to generate emotions. What if something threatens the kid? What if it plays a major role in the turn of events? What if he turns out to be evil or makes a mistake that costs the lives of many people? That generates emotions now. It wouldn't be the same at all if the investment is narrated instead of played, as in "You have a dear sister and now she is in trouble because..." because yes, the player would certainly react but will feel that emotion is an imposition and while tolerable, this imposition could even break immersion for some players.<br/><br/>It's the same with antagonists. That's why my policy now isn't to create a big bad evil boss completely detailing all the scenes that will show him/her being evil. It won't matter how many imaginary people he kills, that will only make players feel justified to destroy him. What I do now is introduce generic dudes and monsters, get ready to see them killed by the players "just because they are there and may have treasure" and keep my eyes peeled at whatever the dice decide. Once in a while, one of these generic templates gets some help from the dice, which I explain by adding detail to it and turning it into a character. The amount of actual hate these NPCs get only increases with every little detail I add here and there and players go to any extent to get rid of them, and really enjoy seeing them fall. <br/><br/>On top of it, it doesn't disappoint me as a GM when any of these NPCs (good or bad) don't get to show any scenes I scripted for them because players choices doesn't get them there. Because, and I know I'm not alone on this habit, GMs also get invested in whatever they create, which often ends up in doing some good or bad railroading, generating illusions of choice and fumbling rolls to show whatever you made to the players exactly as you envisioned and getting an specific reaction from them.<br/><br/>Which brings me to mechanical resources to elicit emotional responses from the players: from my experience, it's exactly the same than Illusionism; they work as long as players believe in them. The fact that there isn't a GM behind it doesn't make it "more ethic" or less prone to gamification. Often players who don't believe in these mechanics will push the system buttons to get what they want and will laugh instead of feeling like they are betraying an NPC, for example.<br/><br/>This is a bit of a derailing issue, but I'm kinda sad how some people around here consider Illusionism a terrible practice, while it can be a perfectly valid fun as much as old school gaming, using mechanics to elicit emotions or anything else, <i>as long as everyone on the table knows it's being used and chooses to believe in it, fully participating in the activity thus making it a game instead of a crime against the right of others to dream.</i><br/><br/>Anyway, if players believe in the mechanics, anything can truly go. Personally I prefer procedures that help players build content, as this is an important first step to invest emotions into anything: making it part of the world as a decision of your own, instead of letting someone else decide that for you. If then somebody takes it and respectfully builds on it, it starts to grow and get emotions attached that develop by themselves as it moves through the shared space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450334/#Comment_450334" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T15:53:32+00:00" title="January  5, 2016  3:53PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2016 3:54PM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            doublepost<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3xJ" title="3xJ"><img alt="3xJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3xJ">3xJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450342/#Comment_450342" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T18:03:31+00:00" title="January  5, 2016  6:03PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2016 2:03PM by 3xJ.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>This is a bit of a derailing issue, but I'm kinda sad how some people around here consider Illusionism a terrible practice, while it can be a perfectly valid fun as much as old school gaming, using mechanics to elicit emotions or anything else, <i>as long as everyone on the table knows it's being used and chooses to believe in it, fully participating in the activity thus making it a game instead of a crime against the right of others to dream.</i><br/></blockquote>\nLet's make another thread and talk about that!

So then, the question remains - how do we get the most players to <i>believe</i> in these mechanical resources? one way, my guess atleast, would be tying the mechanical resources to former investments (be that time, creativity, a goal accomplished.) and by making the use of them risky. You know, either like the burning wheel or like Annalise. Or by tying the game itself into a moral space, like Dogs in the vineyard, and letting it be up to the player whether they are affected.<br/>My theory is, the more of these elements you combine, the greater the chance for a "barf of emotion" to occur as the tension reaches a climax.<br/><br/>Or sometimes, simply by making the most mechanically sound option <i>not always</i> the most enticing. But that is a landmine of a subject. Gah, i think i am derailling myself now!<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Warriormonk, am i getting it right if you say that long time investment if you are playing to see what happens, and by making it clear than major NPC's emerge and become important, but starting as minor? I do imagine how one could put that into mechanics instead of advice... Darwinistic approach to villains and NPC's - I have toyed with that idea myself.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450354/#Comment_450354" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T23:19:28+00:00" title="January  5, 2016 11:19PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my point is more that it's harder for mechanics to take care of building up the emotional barf, since mechanics shortcut through a more natural path that it's already resumed into a minimal expression by the game itself. As a result, mechanics often feel as artificial fictional impositions. <br/><br/>That being said, players who are better at immersion through acting their characters, can go around this easily and use mechanics at their fullest. For them, things like alignment will often lack enough subtlety, using and compelling Fate-like Aspects will do affect their characters, and mechanics like Primetime Adventure's fanmail or Aiki Chits from Tenra Bansho Zero will help a great deal. Also, the Emotional Matrix from Tenra Bansho would be enough to put a random emotional constraint into a scene, which will help in turn define what the next story twist will be.<br/><br/>Regular players would need something more akin to a natural development of emotions through interaction with the fiction, as I described in my post above. It can also be obtained through a certain degree of illusionism/good railroading. It's not like there aren't other shortcuts besides the mechanical ones. Proof is right there on the video you posted: a great deal of videogames are made in a fashion to convey specific emotions to you, even while offering an open world. They just use illusionism to limit your actions and choices in a way that optimizes the emotional effect of their prep, that's all. It's nothing a skillful GM can't pull out while giving players even a wider range of available choices.<br/><br/>I just don't use that way of GMing anymore, since it often requires a vast amount of prep that needs to be completed in a short time, which stresses the heck out of me, preventing me from enjoying the game. Thus I resorted to playing unsafe, letting players provide more material and detail into the fiction and using emergent material to fuel back the flow. The side effect is great too!: Players feel more invested in the fiction, it's easier to ellicit a bunch of emotions there and I'm perfectly okey building over other people's material, it saves me a lot of time and the results are often surprising for me too, as well as for the players themselves. The story really gets written in the gaming table, as opposed as written in mine and then wrestled into the player's experience.<br/><br/>For this sake, procedures work way better than mechanics. You will only need to follow certain procedures once for them to produce a lot of awesome playing material, they will guide you into developing the world and discovering the story. Procedures such as lists of questions and random tables to create the setting, character's backgrounds, etc. Whatever returns to you material optimized for creating emotional content will do. And if these are meant to be used by the players insted by the GM only, way better. The GM can add the details, color and of course define how much of this input is truth to avoid ruining the surprise to the players.<br/><br/>BTW, this is just my personal and my group's taste. I'd said there's nothing wrong at trying the mechanic approach if your group believe in it. Most probably with the right group, anything will work wonders, specially if it's designed with a specific setting on mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450401/#Comment_450401" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T17:45:40+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  5:45PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a sidenote, I think it's a bit misleading to say that the GM must create emotional investment in the player, the way that, say, a videogame does.

But if the game is built so that, later, you can only save half of your Friends, then it becomes interesting. How many friends do you want to have? Who will you save? Will you become friends with people you don't care about so you can sacrifice them in the stead of the people you really like?

You just hit a tangent i want to talk about sometime in another thread: Non-numerical ways to give certain aspects of your character weight in a game concerned with the narrative spaces and niches which each character occupies. <br/><br/>You know, instead of ye olde<br/>"Oath "X" +number"0 - where numerical bonus applies in situations relevant to x<br/><br/>it is<br/><br/>Oath "X": <br/>You can only be persuaded from your oath if you choose to. If you do so, you break your oath.<br/>May demand scene regarding oath after x of your scenes where the oath has not been put into play.<br/>if you break your oath, your next scene must either revolve around you being dishonored, or you gaining a grudge.<br/><br/>Lateral and mechanically heavy development is something i hope to see more of in storytelling games. They always seem to fill a large box of text though, and must be tailor made for the genre/tone you are trying to create with your game. And playbook based games can really box one in (really cool point and topic though!!!) ...<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>... But before i derail myself, back to the point.  If i were to create a game (it is one of the objectives of my game) for players who wanted to invest their emotions into something, and it needed to build up, i am trying to uncover how to <b>cause that build-up</b>, and the <b>following explosion</b>, in terms of game mechanics, rules and procedures. So, it is not only <b>what</b> causes the build up, it is <b>how</b> to cause it, and what semi-related elements may help causing it.<br/><br/>This is not a specific design question though. I want to dig into the whole topic, discussed through examples, and mechanics/procedures/rules/ques (whatever, really) people feel support either this build-up, or the actual "barf." <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450566/#Comment_450566" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-12T04:15:45+00:00" title="January 12, 2016  4:15AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far my list of things that help with the how is built around these pillars:<br/><br/>1-Have players<i> create</i> a good part of the content themselves. Creating something establishes a sense of ownership between the creator and the thing created. Even if you make something for collective use, even if you're ready to give it away, you will have an emotional reaction whenever someone interacts with the material in some form. Because when players do this they recognize your creation, and by doing that, as if it were an extension of your identity, you feel yourself recognized. It's a good part of what makes the GM's work fun, the other being the joy of creating itself.<br/><br/>I haven't searched for scientifical support of this, perhaps it has already been researched somewhere but take it as pseudoscience so far. Yet I feel that the amount of GMs who railroad to protect the material they have created until it's experienced the way they want, is somewhat a confirmation of this observation.<br/><br/>2-Build upon player's creation with respect to their intent and enhance it. The idea is to start a flow of recognition from player to player, which improves the mood of the group, enhances immersion and sets up ground for everyone to express emotions with confidence. As you get treated by your peers as a worthy respectable warrior, it's easier for you to immerse in the role and act like one. The group is reinforcing this temporal identity so it's easier for you to adopt it and act accordingly: you adapt your tone of voice, body language and reactions in the game to fit the role. Having the game mechanics, the GM or the players block or interrupt this ruins the immersion and the players falls back to his usual personality as a defense mechanism since at least, that's a personality already approved by the group.<br/><br/>3-Use the dice as an excuse to progressively rise the threat of the setting against whatever player's creations has more emotions invested in it. Ripping it apart in front of them with no good excuse just to generate emotions is like breaking a child's toy in his face. You're bound to get a reaction, yes, but not a controlled one. Your group may be grown ups, laugh about it to break immersion, react in character, etc, but they will definitely feel betrayed at some level. <br/><br/>The group needs trust in order to share their creations; destroying a creation which has seen emotional investment feels like an aggresion towards the creator and investors by extension, so expect players to get back at whoever does this, using the shared world as a weapon for this. It may totally ruin the fun if either the GM or players take things too personally. We all have seen some of these cases. But then, if you use the dice and build up the threat level anytime there's a fumbled roll, things are different. At it's worst, people will blame the dice and not the GM. Even better if you tempt them with risking damage to something they created to gain something else; in that case they will get to blame themselves for taking that bet in the first place. You would get more or less the same effect without losing the player's trust.<br/><br/>4-(On a low roll, temporally) take away player's control of the world. This works wonders for horror. It increases the sense of vulnerability of the players, as their extensions (the PCs) are helpless to stop or change whatever is going on with the world.<br/><br/>Uh, too late for my brain to keep functioning, I'll probably add something else tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450571/#Comment_450571" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-12T05:52:34+00:00" title="January 12, 2016  5:52AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding trust as a factor: I totally agree with this. Here's a thing I've seen happen a lot with players who are new to either RPGs in general, or the kind of shared storytelling games I like to play specifically: They keep an emotional distance. They put forward ideas that are silly and clash with the established fiction. Maybe part of this is inexperience, but I think part of it is also lack of trust. If they put forward things they are really invested in, that they really think are their best ideas, and those ideas get shot down by the group, then that will hurt their ego. It's a rejection of the player, not just the idea. But if they put forward ideas that they obviously don't believe in themselves, then there is no threat in these ideas being shot down. I did a similar thing myself at school: I woldn't study properly for a test, because if I really made an effort and didn't do well, then I'd have failed. If I didn't make an effort and did badly, I could always tell myself I could have done better if I had tried.<br/><br/>So the solution to this is to always take people's ideas seriously, always encourage them and make their ideas mean something. Eventually I find they relax and start putting their best ideas forward. This will facilitate investment and thus the barf.<br/><br/>And now you're thinking "Yeah, but you can't encode trust into the mechanics", except you totally can. I'm a firm believer in mechanics. Make "putting ideas forward" into a mechanical thing. You write the thing (a character, an event, whatever) on a piece of paper and put it in the middle of the table. Then a bunch of other mechanics do things with this piece of paper. The piece of paper becomes important and shapes play over a long time. Players find that when they write things down on pieces of paper, the things are taken seriously and affect the game, so they put things they want to see on the pieces of paper, and they invest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450583/#Comment_450583" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-12T15:47:42+00:00" title="January 12, 2016  3:47PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly! Here's where "Say yes or roll the dice" actually shines as a mechanic. No, not a principle: a mechanic. It has to be something used every single time to solve creative agenda conflicts, because it will generate trust as a byproduct.<br/><br/>In my experience, either asking players for creative material or starting a brainstorming with strangers, the most usual first reaction for anyone is to shoot back a random idea that they think is stupid enough to make everyone laugh, so they can stop being the focus of attention, since coming with something good and seeing it being blocked or even mocked by the group is stressful.<br/><br/>So I've turned "say yes" into my default reaction. I take whatever thing they say and give it a spin to make it interesting and bam! it takes people by surprise that they nailed at the first try and it has suddenly opened an universe of options. You can actually notice how their face stops laughing, their shoulders drop as their lower their guard and their eyes slightly lose focus for an instant, as they immerse in the world they have just created. Then they frantically start to add input or correct themselves, and you will notice then that this time their input is much more suited to their actual tastes. Because now they trust that they will be taken seriously no matter what they say.<br/><br/>Its curious also how people police themselves out of gonzo if you start straight with it. Unless it's so fun they don't care anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
