Villain, Villain<br/>They each choose some traits that can influence (step up/down) die sizes, some relationship NPCs and some front-loading of inter-PC relationships<br/>They rate their effectiveness in various types of scenes (chase/skirmish, interpersonal, investigation, battle/big fight, etc.) with dice; this part is private and the die sizes are secret until revealed. The Villain side overall has slightly better die sizes than the PCs for the pre-Showdown scenes.<br/><br/>Scenes are played in free play until a conflict is reached, during conflicts various props are introduced on index cards, and one of them will generally be kept and reincorporated.<br/><br/>Once all the scenes have been played, the Showdown happens. Its mechanics are similar to the pre-Showdown scenes, though I think there\u2019s more emphasis on reincorporating old props and introducing fewer new ones. It\u2019s played in rounds, so it doesn\u2019t hinge on a single roll. Things are weighted in favor of the hero side; if they lose then the villain gets away but still doesn\u2019t succeed in their evil scheme. If the heroes win showdown early (that is, get so far ahead the villain can\u2019t catch up), then there is a final danger such as the classic fortress self-destruct, and one of the heroes may die, or a relationship NPC may die, or something like that.<br/><br/>So: Simulationism.

I could see how it could be, but it hasn't awakened that drive in e.g. myself.<br/><br/>Rules systems do not have creative agenda, they will at most fit in naturally and intuitively with one. GURPS happens to fit Sim well (you get to play to see what happens, and you get to appreciate the events not only on narrative level, but also through the beautiful dance of the numbers), and it'd probably fit some sort of Gamism as well, even if it doesn't do that for us at this time, with this particular combination of people.<br/><br/>If you need to talk about a rules text + creative agenda, the easiest way is to talk about a way of using the rules. As in, "we use GURPS to see whether my character can learn to punch out a dragon." The GURPS part isn't that CA-relevant, but the rest might well work to clarify it. Some games, of course, only have so many reasonable ways of using the rules, which is where you get a "focused" game that only does one thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447184/#Comment_447184" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-23T14:12:50+00:00" title="July 23, 2015  2:12PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Genre Emulation mechanics have always been a bit weird when people have tried to create them.<br/><br/>There's a strong vein of thought in mainstream design that these are <i>games</i>, and games <i>always</i> must have an element of competition somewhere, or they aren't <i>games</i>.<br/><br/>Which might be true.

The concept of "genre Sim" seems to be really, really good for people to get a handle on what Sim is - at some level at least - but then it also immediately becomes a stumbling block in understanding that "that other sort of Sim" is the same exact thing, and that there aren't any walls between them.<br/><br/>Take GURPS for example. It is possible that people could understand what it means to do Sim with it better if they could detach from the whole question of their personal relationship to mechanics-heavy point-buy games, and just look at it as a Sim game that happens to be generic (so you choose your Sim at the point of application), and happens to involve a lot of math and such as a matter of taste. I haven't played Fudge more than a couple of sessions, but as far as I understand, GURPS and Fudge deliver essentially the same creative agenda, they just use a different amount of rules to do it. Heck, Wushu probably would go the same way if it didn't have a default setting.<br/><br/>I mean, mechanical weight is not an indicator of the underlying creative agenda any more than use of dice or playing cards is, right? If a Narrativist game has a fuckload of rules like say <i>Burning Wheel</i> does, that's not because it belongs in some special Nar box - it's because the designer and players like mechanically proficient play that occurs on multiple levels, with mechanical interplay and fictional events merging together into a kind of experience unique to that sort of game. It's a matter of taste and capabilities in execution, same as using funny voices for NPCs, not a Creative Agenda classification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447186/#Comment_447186" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-23T14:38:22+00:00" title="July 23, 2015  2:38PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we can get people understanding GenEmSim, it's easier to work outward.<br/><br/>A lot of disagreements within Sim seem to revolve around technical agendas ( I guess that's what things like lite vs heavy, cards vs dice, etc would count as).<br/><br/>At some level, it seems like there's a lot of agreement already, broadly, assuming you accept GNS at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447187/#Comment_447187" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-23T15:50:04+00:00" title="July 23, 2015  3:50PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2015 3:53PM by WarriorMonk.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the mix of the forgite stuff (that I came late to) I half remember the GNS talk. I think I remembered mosty that Sim was about physics emulation, getting the fictional world right... and I couldn't wrap my idea of fun around that at all. <br/><br/>I remember now that it was also about genre emulation but once I got it then... well, it didn't switched anything on my mind, I was already hacking/making games with less restrictive mechanics to get the anime flavor i was lookinf for on those days. Yet all I found about sim games that helped to get that atmosphere felt again, way too restrictive for my group. You see, we're the kind of guys that could play TOON with D&amp;D 3.5 or VtM with no need for mechanics that pushed us into the genre, so for us going anime was just a matter of having more flexible rules instead of mechanics to sim the physics or help us add slapstick comedy.<br/><br/>But that was back then, now I realize that there are other genres that our group would like to play but which they strive to get into, most of times missing the atmosphere. And I've seen great mechanics that could help us sim into that. I've even found out that there were a ton of mechanics in trad games that we hadn't used that turn the game into something completely different, like the Humanity in VtM and the reverse turn order where characters with celerity declare their actions after everyone else, effectively as if they were seeing everything in slow motion and then reacting to it.<br/><br/>So yes, like any abstract tool that helps us understand the world in one way or another GNS can be useful. Yet I'm not sure that disagreements can be prevented, even if we all accept it at some level since we all still have different ways to understand the world and focus on different aspects of it at different times.

After all, it's the complete opposite of the "constructive denial" which, at one point, was touted as being definitional to Sim.  But no, Jason thought it was a useful enough approach to mention it in the Fiasco Companion, and several of my gaming groups have since gotten a lot of mileage from taking explicit looks at the source.  Before my recent mini-campaign of World Wide Wrestling, we actually watched some pro wrestling so the less wrestling-savvy among us could refer to it in play.<br/><br/>In contrast, "going back to the source" isn't always viable in a lot of beloved, Sim-encouraging RPGs out there.  I mean, what's our shared reference for Werewolf: the Apocalypse?  What are we celebrating?  I've heard it argued that when a team of furry badasses with different powers and worldviews goes on a mission together, what's <i>really</i> being celebrated is X-Men comics, but even if that's true, that doesn't do much good for a group who's unaware of it.  In that case, there's no ability to say, "my inspiration has waned; what would Cyclops &amp; Wolverine do here?"  More importantly, there's no ability to say, "whoa, that thing you did is cool for how it resembles or departs from what Cyclops would have done!"<br/><br/>In some cases, I think the source material is the Werewolf books themselves -- there's plenty of stuff in there that a group can celebrate or emulate, but only if all the players develop an appreciation of it first.  Some groups did this!  But others just left the book-reading to the GM.<br/><br/>Of course, the Werewolf authors didn't invent all their content from scratch.  It's a grab bag of themes and tropes players may already have plenty of references for.  X-Men plus Captain Planet plus werewolf monster movies, perhaps?  How much of the same stuff gets through to different players?  How much overlap and coherence is enough?  If the goal is a shared standard for appreciating each other's contributions, I'd bet that me riffing off Wolf while you riff of Captain Planet is far from sufficient.<br/><br/>Depending on how you view Simulationism, a little blurriness of source/reference material can be a big deal or not a big deal at all.

It's just that the "genre" thing is usually conceived of in a sort of over-pronounced, exaggerated manner. It's treated as if if it isn't cliche, then you don't have the same creative mechanisms underlying the Sim as you do with a cliche-ridden game. This then confuses a person when they encounter a Sim game that doesn't rely on a really trope-filled literary genre as the cultural background upon which it acts.<br/><br/>Try it this way: if we call "genre Sim" with the equivalent name of "cultural background Sim", and define it the exact same way, except that instead of thinking of it as "genre" you think of it as "the shared appreciation of some fictional focus of play", perhaps that would help get over the hurdle of treating "genre Sim" as a sort of subcategory. That differentiation might well be illusionary, caused by people attempting to approach understanding Sim from multiple perspectives instead of just one.<br/><br/>GURPS, the way I've witnessed it, has been pretty clearly Sim, and the "genre" has certainly been heavily present. Sometimes the genre is just not quite a genre in the literary history sense. Often it is, such as in this dungeon fantasy campaign we've played. The genre of that has of course been "dungeon fantasy", that literary melange of post-tolkienist fantasy and D&amp;D. Projecting out from that to a less "genrified" GURPS game, I don't really see anything structural changing - so OK, you play a kitchensink multiverse GURPS game with mages and cyborgs and whatnot, so it very clearly does not limit itself to the tropes of a single genre. It's still the same game about giving point scores to your doll and having it fight other dolls; shine in spotlight for using a trained skill; calculate encumbrance; build weapons with the weapon-building subsystem. All of these activities are prone to produce the same kind of Sim appreciation (celebration of the fictive content, to be specific) whether the underlying subject matter is "my character's a cyborg and he's in a war against a council of wizards" or more conventionally "my character's a cowboy and it's a Western with all the trappings". The presence of a "genre" in the latter example changes nothing for the actual operation of the creative mechanism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447196/#Comment_447196" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-23T18:26:19+00:00" title="July 23, 2015  6:26PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2015 6:27PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>All of these activities are prone to produce the same kind of Sim appreciation (celebration of the fictive content, to be specific) whether the underlying subject matter is "my character's a cyborg and he's in a war against a council of wizards" or more conventionally "my character's a cowboy and it's a Western with all the trappings".

And yeah, that's what the celebratory part was: We're referencing the WWtA universe.<br/><br/>I think that may have been more successful in some ways due to the popularity of the Splatbooks, especially in the case of early VtM.

It's Phys-Sim ish, right?<br/>The very next thing done is a negotiation: What are we going to use this stuff for, exactly?And how much of it are we going to use? That's when the Cultural Background Sim part comes into play.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the negotiation process classically is something along the lines of " Hey, I want to run a game. We'll use GURPS as the core rules. Here's my idea [insert elevator pitch, usually filled with cultural references itself, here]. Do you guys want to play?"<br/><br/>Now, this does point a bit to the idea that generally supportive tools for Sim need not be GURPs-y Phys Sim.  They could also be mechanics mostly meant to help the playgroup come together and agree on those Cultural Background points <i><b>during play.</b></i><br/><br/>I remember going around and around on The Forge talking about how I thought <i>Universalis</i> was a great Sim supportive tool. Pretty much everyone, most importantly the authors, thought I was a nutter at first. After all, Universalis is supposed to be one of those really early Narr games, right?<br/><br/>To me, the whole thing is amazingly Sim supportive! The first act of play is to create the core of the material to be celebrated, for goodness sake. After tha all of the mechanics of play create what amounts to a dialog over what is/is not acceptable based on that! It's about as sim-supportive as you can get, even if it looks vastly different from GURPs. Frankly, I never saw how it could even be argued to be Narr-supportive at all, other than it was a weirdo looking design, created by Forge participants at a time when Narr was the Golden Boy of the indie scene.<br/><br/>Likewise, Mythic GM Emulator's mechanics also support a constant and running group dialog about what is/is not acceptable as an understanding of whatever source material is being celebrated when using those mechanics as your core engine.

The joy of it is largely on revelation and acknowledgement shared with others: "Oh, so that's how it looks like when this thing I've only ever read about is actually applied in practice!"\n<blockquote>As a follow up to something I said in the other thread, what role does the 15% marginally acceptable result or the 5% really weird result play into this whole cycle?</blockquote>\nThese results are important, I think, exactly because they force you to apply the cultural material at the game's focus: what does it look like in this genre/reality/subculture/place/time when this unexpected thing happens. If the exceptional never happens, the ordinary has less chance of being noticed and appreciated, because that ordinary thing only becomes relevant to anything whatsoever against the contrast of the extraordinary.<br/><br/>For example, let's consider Mulan (largely because I just started reading "Judge Dee" detective novels and have China in the brainpan): Mulan is interesting for Sim purposes in that the concept of the gender role breaking woman becoming a soldier, set in Han era China, concretely asks us to apply what we know regarding the time and place to a specific subject matter. In what ways of behavior and speech does a father discourage a tomboy girl from her inclinations, considering that the father is a Confucian gentleman? How about the mother? What if Mulan does this or that, how does the world react? All interesting and relevant questions that <i>could not occur</i> without the 20% "off-color" material - in this case, Mulan herself. The setting only gets to truly define itself against the context of those occasional exceptional results.<br/><br/>Similarly, to pick a less sweeping example, the idea that the hero might fail can be fruitfully used in many genres generally considered very formulaic and staid. Western can deal with it if the hero exceptionally makes a moral mistake; superhero story can deal with it if the hero "dies". It is not necessary to build your Sim game to leave that slim chance of protagonist failure in there (despite roleplayers traditionally having trouble orienting to the idea that they might be rolling dice without even a theoretical chance of failure), but it is one way you can go when considering the way the conventional clashes with the exceptional in your design. Of course the exceptional still needs to be constructive, so you're unlikely to see a Sim game where the Enterprise just goes Poof because somebody forgot to turn on the proton shield.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447232/#Comment_447232" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-25T19:06:57+00:00" title="July 25, 2015  7:06PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2015 7:08PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What I'm poking at is the idea that somewhere in Sim play, mechanized and officialized or not, there's a process during play of honing the shared cultural background.

The fact that group aesthetic coherence <i>can</i> occur without design doesn't say anything about the odds.  Some gamebook and some pitch and some riffing off each other in play can get you there... or not.  <br/><br/>It seems to me that the desired/necessary standard of coherence depends on the relationship of the group to the source material.  To share a genre parody, we need know only the genre's stereotypes; to share a sub-genre celebration, on the other hand, I may be letting my group down if I don't share their knowledge of the details that make Stargate different from Star Trek.  <br/><br/>To share any sort of take on a less clear package of source and reference material, various parameters may need to be adopted independently -- calls on tone, realism, and changes to the status quo, for example, may not find simple, common origins in a favorite text.  Do we find appreciation for each other's contributions in reference to a vision of (a) snarky, gonzo space opera that resets to equilibrium after each session, or (b) dour, physics-faithful space opera that kills, marries and otherwise upheaves its cast with lasting consequences?<br/><br/>Whatever the answer is, what's the best way to get there?  Does the gamebook need to call out the ways in which play should be like Firefly, and the other ways in which it should be like Babylon 5, and the additional ways in which it should be like no space opera show ever made (e.g. "Tarantino dialgoue!")?  Do the players need to do this themselves, with or without procedural help?  Or is the eventual amalgam of standards for play something that can't be consciously enumerated, and should be left to the ephemeral matters of individual taste which govern our responses in play anyway?  <br/><br/>Are we ever really building new standards for appreciation, or are we merely honing in on the overlap of what we already like?  Or does satisfying Sim play need to do both, giving us both a high-five on the familiar and an eye-opener on the new frontiers our friends bring to the table?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447233/#Comment_447233" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-25T19:16:21+00:00" title="July 25, 2015  7:16PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2015 7:17PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having thrown out a bunch of questions which may defy answers, I'll shift gears and actually contribute a useful technique here:<br/><br/>A few years back, <a href="/forums/profile/jenskot">@jenskot</a> was working on a "make a movie from scratch" one-shot RPG, and the first phase involved passing around genre index cards for players to include, exclude, or ignore.  Phase two was the part I really liked -- <i>for each genre you included, note succinctly <b>what about it</b> you like and want to see in play</i>.  This wasn't always easy, but the process of going through it (often out loud) gave us valuable insights into what each other was thinking.  <br/><br/>On the downside, blending as many genres as the group saw fit often left some uncertainty in play about which standards applied to which moments.  I think time and play began clarifying that, but not quickly enough for a one-shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447234/#Comment_447234" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-25T19:43:47+00:00" title="July 25, 2015  7:43PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An interesting observation (well, interesting to me): Sim seems to have some sort of a joint destiny with the idea of "genre mashup"; I hardly ever see that hankering for the mashup come up anywhere else. The weird part is that the mashup often represents itself to me as a <i>poison</i> that generally speaking ruins games rather than improves them.<br/><br/>For example, GURPS is an obvious starting point - something like 20% of the GURPS-related creative excitement I see here (I've gotten to know what goes on in the minds of GURPS players a bit, participating in a campaign) seems to be about genre mashups in one way or another. The game text of course encourages it a bit - the default setting of the game is a multiverse kitchen sink and so on.<br/><br/>Universalis is another one, the majority of the Universalis games I hear about share the traits of genre mashup, aimlessness and superficialness - the players who like the experience, it seems to me, were the ones for whom simply being able to play through a session with monkeys in spaceships is an accomplishment, never mind aimlessness. (Trying to describe a certain sort of Zilchplay or something - I know what I mean, I just don't apparently have  punchy way to describe it right now. Besides the point, anyway.)<br/><br/>In general, particularly Simmish games often have some weird resonance with genre mashup, such as with the setting agnostic rules systems - not just GURPS, but also things like Fudge and FATE. Likewise, odds seem to be that a game where the creative ambitions rise to the height of "hey wouldn't it be cool to have wizards in there too" tend towards the Simmish in my experience - no doubt that has something to do with the way the genre mashup entices a person creatively with visual imagery, mainly, which is pretty much something Sim will deliver for you. If the thing you want to do in a game is to imagine monkeys in spaceships fighting a war with space wizards on dinosaurs, for the sake of the kewl, Sim's got you covered.<br/><br/>(To clarify, while the mashup tendency in Universalis has been rotten to me, a strong indicator of the game going nowhere, in our GURPS campaign the multiversal elements and such have worked much better. Other games have been more towards the Universalis end of the continuum, with genre mashup indicating a lack of ideas and cohesion. I'm not saying that it's always a problem, just that I see Sim and genre mashup going together often, and not nearly always in a good way.)<br/><br/>Of course there are games particularly associated with other agendas that also feature things that could be called "genre mashup". Old school D&amp;D, for instance, seems to work well in a certain sort of "space fantasy" genre represented by things like Anomalous Subsurface Environment and Carcosa - I've long thought that I should do He-Man and the Masters of the Universe as a D&amp;D game, it'd be right at home. I have to say, though, thinking about it, that perhaps these sorts of examples of other agendas doing genre mashup aren't quite so... frivolous as the thing you get in Universalis and similar games with players adding in survivalist squirrels just to fill in space. It could be the case that I don't even know of a single true genre mashup game that <i>wasn't</i> Simmy, and all the other cases are just cross-genre or set in exotic genres. Gets into semantics, to be sure.<br/><br/>No idea if any of that stands a closer look; just a late-night idea. Also no idea what it means, except maybe that combining genres for the sake of vivid imagery may be mostly meaningful for Simmish interests, and not so relevant for other sorts of creative agenda. Maybe it works as a short-cut to original play where painting-by-the-numbers in a single genre feels too claustrophobic and nobody feels like reading a 200-page setting book to base play on something original and less generic than a handy genre label.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447238/#Comment_447238" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-26T02:54:55+00:00" title="July 26, 2015  2:54AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting point about genre mashups.

It seems to me that a game which looks towards a shared vision as its organizing principle - being focused entirely on the Exploration itself, in Big Model terms - can easily "forget" what it's actually going to be about.<br/><br/>I mean, you can have a "monkeys in spaceships" game with a very clear, uh... creative agenda. (Not capitalizing; I mean it in the regular, English sense of those words.) We're here to explore THIS thing, with THIS intention (maybe, like in Planet of the Apes, it's a parody of humanity at the same time as an exploration of how expansion through space would work if the people involved were brutish, obsessed with a physical pecking order, and resolved most conflicts with violence).<br/><br/>Or you can sit down with the same intention of playing "monkeys and spaceships"... and <i>nothing else</i>.<br/><br/>You've got a vision, somewhat, focused on the fictional content of the game, but no sense of how the group and the players in it are to focus on that content. How do we bring it to life? What do we do with it? Why?<br/><br/>That makes it tremendously difficult, I think, to have a fun and functional game, and I haven't seen a lot of tools for bringing this kind of thing about.<br/><br/>In a Gamist agenda, we can draw on a great deal of knowledge about games and competition, old and new - from game theory, from chess, from human social conflict and one-upmanship, gambling, and so forth. In a Narrativist situation, we have - I would argue, thanks to the Forge - some great tools which cut to the meat of the matter: have strong protagonists in conflict, on the edge of a moral premise, and so forth.<br/><br/>But in a "Sim" game, I haven't seen so many tools which help you really focus the experience and cut out the "chaff". Maybe this is because the whole field in under-explored by "theory types" (and especially so historically speaking). Or maybe it's because it's a natural tendency for people who are really, honestly excited about the source material to immerse themselves in that and forget about the actual gameplay.<br/><br/>However, this understanding (even if not overt) is necessary to create principled play - or, put another way, to allow the players to <i>get better</i> at playing the game ("this kind of move is good, this kind is useless...") as they go along.<br/><br/>I see counterexamples in strong GM-auteur games (where one person's vision can completely take over), like some heavily-railroaded dramas (e.g. the "4 out 7 cried" thread), improv-comedy style play, and Nordic LARP, which all clearly lay out what the game is about and how the players can achieve it. I also see it in games like Fiasco (the conceit of a "making a Coen Brothers film" implies a whole number of principles and agenda for the players to follow, and the text and rules are all focused on bringing those out even more).<br/><br/>Well, I guess that's my turn at another late-night post. Maybe it makes sense, who knows?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447242/#Comment_447242" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-26T07:22:34+00:00" title="July 26, 2015  7:22AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's weird that you guys keep talking about monkeys in spaceships, because for about a week now I've been planning an upcoming session of DayTrippers in which the (solo) PC is in fact a monkey, and he will be in a spaceship!

I've used Showdown for fantasy/medieval styled action tales as well as futuristic and modern/80's or WW2-era "movies." Now I kind of want to try some sort of time travel multiverse weirdness and see if it still hangs together. I think it might, since the game rules are so strongly focused on keeping things moving towards the exciting climax and in reinforcing the rules of the overall genre.<br/><br/> (Also worth noting somewhere in here: that the AW engine is so creatively fruitful because the "meta-genre" in which it's working is "ensemble character drama.")<br/><br/>I guess what I'm getting at is that if the underlying thematic materials of two different characters or fictional elements are [i]too[/i] far apart, then it can become hard to know how to celebrate it. If I'm a monkey piloting a spaceship, and you're an Elf wizard, well, ok, we can fight monsters and get treasure together and it may be fine. But if I'm a spaceship monkey, you're an Elf wizard, Tim is a lantern-jawed [i]telenovela[/i] brain surgeon, Jane is Queen Elizabeth I, and Frankie is a Vietnamese rice farmer, suddenly things are more difficult. It's not that such an array of characte<br/><br/>Incidentally, where GURPS fails IME is when<br/><br/>(a) the mechanics for the different characters' sub-genres are so disparate as to render one or more characters irrelevant and under-powered,<br/><br/>or, more mundanely,<br/><br/>(b) its lower-case-s simulationistic mechanics actively interfere with the genre's feel.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447245/#Comment_447245" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-26T12:29:52+00:00" title="July 26, 2015 12:29PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wasn't GURPS created because people were already doing genre mash-ups? It was supposed to give users a lingua franca to do t with, rather than cobbling together other systems that weren't compatible mechanically, right?<br/><br/>As for genre mashups more generally, I think part of it may be an urge for humor. I don't know that it always works out that way, but I suspect it's somewhere in there.<br/><br/>Also, Eero may be right with part of it as well. With a mashup, it might actually be easier in some ways to play than concentrating heavily on one single genre and really delving into it thoroughly. Because it's a mashup, no one feels as deeply committed to/intimidated by a need for mastery of the single genre, and can get away with broader, surface level knowledge of tropes and stereotypes-the cultural background part.<br/><br/>Now, as for thinking a bit about mechanics...<br/><br/>Option 1: The mainstream approach ( GURPS as example)<br/>Borrow gamist mechanics (Phys Sim)and create a lingua franca that is front-loaded and we all agree to their use. We may end up needing to add more mechanics or adjust tem as we play to get closer to the results we ( the play group) want, or think we want, based on our (collective) understanding of the inspirational material.<br/><br/>Classic add-ons that rapidly develop as games move from Gamism to Sim:<br/>Rules that make it harder for main characters to die ( all kinds of kinks to D&amp;D style hit points, so that 0 HP does not = death)<br/>Rules that make it easier for Mooks to die/be defeated<br/>Rules that make it easier for a failure to be turned to a success ( Karma points/Hero Points/Bennies)<br/>Various Behind-the-Screen GM methods, including Pro-PC, Anti-TPK methods<br/><br/>Eventually, those start to get incorporated directly into the initial design, as mainstream design moves further from Gamism and more directly to Genre Emulation ( Sim).<br/><br/>Option 2: Loosey-Goosey Dirty Hippy mechanics<br/>There may be next to no Phys Sim here at all. RISUS may be a half-way point here.<br/><br/>Mechanics more about tossing the whole question of interactions back on play group as a whole, with a feedback loop that encourages gelling of concepts and a development of precedent as a guide, beyond any initial core material.<br/><br/>Downside? It's only really gelling for the distinct, individual play group. Change the composition of the play group, and renegotiation has to occur at some level, before a new Gelled Understanding State is reached.<br/><br/>Aaaand, since we're drifting badly...<br/><br/>What role does art. especially visual art, play in Sim, and is this different from art and its use in Gamism and Narr play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447246/#Comment_447246" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-26T13:22:39+00:00" title="July 26, 2015  1:22PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Are we ever really building new standards for appreciation, or are we merely honing in on the overlap of what we already like?

Seems to me that there's a difference between a game with the starting point of "let's mash genres, oy!" compared to a game that merely happens to be set in a peculiar genre (or more strongly, no audience-recognizable genre at all). The former is more of a "genre mashup game" I think, as it's the players themselves choosing the genres and focusing on the implications of the mashup, while the latter is simply a work set in an exotic genre.<br/><br/>"Genre" is usually understood in literary theory as a set of cultural signifiers that combine into a bunch of variant patterns, tropes that repeat from work to work within the genre. A "meta-genre" would be sort of a parent genre, I guess: we have fantasy adventure movies and then we have plain adventure movies, and basically the former is a subset of the latter.

Anything you might look back on and call a mash-up in retrospect was usually played without any deliberate intent to celebrate/emulate/manipulate/etc.<br/><br/>Example: my longest running GURPS game, in high school, was a "boss and minions" game where each player played two characters.  The "minion" characters were statted up with a limited budget to be various flavors of effective adventurers.  My guy majored in stealth and hand-to-hand, thus I gave him a ninja costume.  I also did my point-whoring with Odious Personal Habits, having the guy chain-smoke cigars, spit on the floor, and be generally rude and vile.  I can't remember the other minions, but none of them had anything in common with mine, color-wise.  There may have been a good-with-guns no-nonsense merc... that sort of color gap.<br/><br/>Our four "boss" characters were basically bent on world conquest, helping each other to overcome the powers that be, but eventually competing to be the one winner.  Here's what I remember:<br/><br/><b>Donovan Hex:</b> Endowed with immortality by a Greek luck god 880-some years ago because 1111 was a lucky year, Hex was basically unkillable, had no other powers, and presented himself as kind of a distinguished illuminati type.  Refined manner, nice suit, tons of connections, implacable, subtly intimidating.  Aimed to be the power behind the throne of world governments, and already pretty much ran much of the U.S.<br/><br/><b>Straxus:</b> An old level 20 D&amp;D character who became an Evil demigod and then inhabitted various spelljammer technology before getting trapped in a ship's guidance crystal by the gods of Good.  That was the backstory; in play, he controlled a main alien robot and also a few auxiliary robots, machines, and features of the crashed ship.  I can't remember his exact plan for Earth, but I think his main goals were to magically escape from the crystal and restore himself to embodied godhood, which would presumably allow him to do as he wished on present-day Earth.  As someone who'd gotten used to being worshipped, Straxus was compulsively imperious, but tried to fight it so as not to completely give away his true nature.<br/><br/><b>The Virus:</b> An artificial intelligence program with a will of its own, this creature could move through any computer systems at will, alter data as it saw fit, and control computer-controlled tech.  The virus harbored some sort of curiosity about becoming a "real" being and understanding humanity, but step one was to take complete control of Earth so it could study as it saw fit.<br/><br/><b>The Envoy:</b> I can't remember who this character was pretending to be, but in reality he was an alien sent to prepare the Earth for conquest.  I think his true form was something monstrous and insectoid, but I don't think we ever saw it until the last session.  His general m.o. was to try to insinuate himself into positions of power -- kind of like Hex, but with more of a political flavor than Hex's private/business/cult deal.<br/><br/>So, what are the references there?  What's the source material?  Well, I knew these guys very well, so I can offer a very educated guess:<br/>- <b>The Minion:</b> Marvel comics, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, G.I. Joe (Spider-Man, Sabretooth, Punisher, Raphael, Stormshadow)<br/>- <b>Donovan Hex:</b> Greek myth, Vampire RPG, Indiana Jones, other Marvel (Tyche, methusalehs, clan Ventrue, Nazi scientists, Kingpin)<br/>- <b>Straxus:</b> Dragonlance novels, Spelljammer books, anime where some horrible power that is imprisoned or held in check threatens to break free (Raistlin, the Overfiend)<br/>- <b>The Virus:</b> 2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator 2, Blade Runner (HAL, SkyNet, Roy Batty)<br/>- <b>The Envoy:</b> Alien comics, X-Men (Mr. Sinister, N'astirh, S'ym)<br/><br/>At no point did we ever try to communicate these influences or bridge these gaps.  The Dragonlance fan and the sci-fi fan didn't read comics, half of us were ignorant of Spelljammer, and plenty of things we all knew (like Indiana Jones) were never communicated and not all that clear anyway.  If we had any unifying priority for play, it was some combo of reveling in these badass characters doing their thing and seeing who, if anyone, would succeed (via inspired GM fiat).  But I'm not sure what our rubric was for celebrating these characters and their doings -- individual notes of familiarity were frequently struck, to be sure, but there was never any coherent aesthetic context.  "Come up with a mission and pursue it, and then see what kind of wacky approach the player next to you comes up with," was more our m.o.  When would Hex bribe, hire, blackmail, or reveal that he already knows that guy in our way?  When would the Virus jump into some new device?  When would Straxus' clunky robot demand that foolish mortals bow before it?  Who would the Minion next offend or unnecessarily chop to ribbons?<br/><br/>From the perspective of Genre Emulation Sim, this is either a fringe case or something else entirely.  From my own history, though, this sort of play was much more common than tangible homages like Dead of Night or World Wide Wrestling.  The motives my high school group brought into play with our grab bag pastiche make sense to me, and I think the result is worth trying to understand.  <br/><br/>Perhaps one way is to look at play as a conversation that goes, "I think this is cool.  Let me show you, so you can see the coolness in it," and then either, "Yeah, cool!" or not.  <br/><br/>- Our basis for decision for "Yeah, cool!" (or not) might be cultural background, or shared reference, or novelty, or just picking up on each other's enthusiasm.<br/><br/>- The thing we want to show off as cool can be a direct reference, vaguely derivative, a mash-up, or as original as it gets.<br/><br/>Note: the "go on adventure missions" structure was <i>not</i> a great vehicle for this.  The GM was just going with physical obstacles a la dungeons, and the fun of having our minions shoot and sneak and slash their way forward was fine, but nothing special.  We were all more psyched about playing our bosses, and that got relatively little screen time.  Importantly, I think a similar problem plagues Rifts, where the typical game sees players concocting really diverse and interesting character types, only to then go out and just shoot stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447288/#Comment_447288" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T00:24:57+00:00" title="July 28, 2015 12:24AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that this kind of play is all about throwing these disparate bits together, reveling in each one individually ("how will this character be badass THIS time?"), and then seeing whether it all hangs together or not. (As evidenced when a player feels that another player is "doing it wrong".)<br/><br/>If it all hangs together in some coherent (or semi-coherent) whole, there is a certain to having pulled it off, to be able to enjoy all these different flavours of "awesome" simultaneously. If it doesn't, typically I've seen players insist that so-and-so "isn't getting it", and calling each other names, like "powergamers" or "munchkins" or "stupid dramatic actors" or some such.<br/><br/>It strikes me that this kind of play is often referenced in the past tense. ("I remember this game I played in high school...") That's certainly how it is for me.<br/><br/>Does anyone have modern/current experiences with it?<br/><br/>Eero, would you tell us more about your GURPS game, if you feel it fits some kind of Sim classification?<br/><br/>As an aside, I was really enjoying the conversation at the bottom of the first page: that seems like the beginnings of some really fruitful application of the theory to game design or troubleshooting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447294/#Comment_447294" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T01:09:48+00:00" title="July 28, 2015  1:09AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2015 1:10AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group never accused anyone of doing anything wrong, as we were completely unaware that there might be a certain something we were attempting to get right.

The GM wanted to run old school D&amp;D except with GURPS rules because he's got GURPS in his head and rarely gets to indulge; I'm participating because my brother is (I want to encourage his social hobbies), and he's participating at least in part because it is <i>not</i> old school D&amp;D, which he doesn't like, but which is pretty common in these circles these days. The group in general is half new to our circles but old GURPSists, half familiar faces.<br/><br/>So the game is a straightforward application of the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy sourcebooks, which are basically somebody's notes for applying GURPS rules to play, well, a GURPS campaign set in the dungeon fantasy genre. There's some verbiage in the books about adapting GURPS to be more D&amp;D-like or whatever, but considering how superficial the D&amp;D understanding is, it's really more of a thin aesthetic flavouring on top of GURPS than any real change to the proceedings. It's not the most vivacious literary choice ever for me, frankly - I'd be playing Dungeon World or something like that if I got a hard-on for D&amp;D tropes without the creative agenda.<br/><br/>In practice the game is about more-or-less prepped adventures stringed together with organic bridge pieces (that is, there's no downtime or abstracted openings, we just talk about where the adventuring party goes next and new adventures fall into our laps at appropriate junctures). The party is following a sort of a quest line, meets "random" encounters (not really random, but unrelated to the main plot) and occasionally contributes to deciding what we'll do next. It's not railroady, but neither are we trying to buckle the GM's plans for the sake of it - no motivation to, as nobody's characters really have anything more going with them than "I wanna be an adventurer". I imagine that a Pathfinder adventure path would be played in almost exactly the same way as this GURPS campaign goes.<br/><br/>I'm playing a martial artist (a "monk" as D&amp;D traditionally has it) myself, and I spend a lot of time in a given game session mostly reading the GURPS rules books (which I've never read before) and listening with half an ear as the party plans and buys stuff and so on. My character is accordingly taciturn and generally goes along with whatever, and as a semi-religious martial artist type he's disinterested in wealth - I don't even track it, simplifying the game for myself. I started with this sort of passive personal positioning originally because I'm unfamiliar with GURPS, didn't know what the creative agenda of the campaign would be, and because I was mostly there as a seat-filler, when all's said and done.<br/><br/>Over a few sessions I found to my surprise that it was pretty fun to just tag along and play a taciturn martial artist with a nigh-obsessive need to prove himself worthy of his master. I understood by observation that we weren't dealing with Gamism (as the GM's pitch and such would have had you understand), but rather princess-play, a form of Simulationism focused on character portrayal: the challenges in the game are generally rather easy for the power level of the characters, the main point of interest is usually about what sort of a feat a given character can or can't pull off when its needed, and the goal is generally to portray your character in a vivacious way as a representative of their D&amp;D character class archetype. The little satisfactions are about calculating how yes, your martial artist character can outrun the wagon the rest of the party are using on this week-long trip between cities; the big satisfactions are about putting together various combat maneuvers and finding that yeah, your character can pretty much just punch down a rock golem with one hit, thanks to the guidance of the Tao, provided he gets a half-minute of set-up time.<br/><br/>In the last session of play, for example, our party were exploring a city that had apparently been hijacked by mighty magics that caused it to float in the sky, while simultaneously the residents had turned into zombies. (Later we found out that these were basically unrelated occurrences - the price of having two characters in the party with the flaw "Trouble Magnet".) I found it pretty entertaining when my character sneaked into the local church and bearded a vampire bishop in his church, in the middle of some sort of a zombie religion ritual - he sneaked in, grappled the vampire and outright grabbed the magical jewel embedded in the vampire's head, wresting it loose, before running away with a vampire and his zombie congregation at his heels. You may imagine how this would feel pretty novel for me, to do this sort of thing simply because I felt like it, with no concerns for tactics or strategy or anything - this game doesn't need that, it's not like I believe that the GM would let my character die or anything even if I take stupid risks in a game where character creation takes five hours <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(An example about how the GM deals with character death: at the end of that same session a necromancer wizard type PC burned themselves out while preventing a demon from breaching out from the nether realms. I'd previously given the vampire's blood gem to the character in question, because it's not like I needed it, I just wanted to see if I could take it. So the GM talked it over with the player, and they agreed that the character would become a vampire next. I did my darnedest to make sure we'd bury the poor perished wizard thoroughly before leaving to continue our quest, but that was just because of ironic humour, not because we didn't know that he'd be back in the next session. We'll see whether I'll need to put him back to rest as an undead monstrosity next time we play, although I imagine that I'll have to get swayed by whatever justifications the party invents for accepting the vampire, in the interest of the genre conceit of adventurers sticking together.)<br/><br/>The GM supports the princess play agenda amazingly well, considering how he thinks that he's emulating old school D&amp;D. His material is varied, faithful to the literary precedents of the genre, and he's always ready to work with the players to enable their characters to express themselves. His material is pretty interesting at times, too - in the very first session, when we found an old third reich-y strongbox with a nerve gas trap, mucho gold bars and a military pistol inside, I have to admit that I started paying attention; the setting is apparently some GURPS default fantasy setting (Yrth is the name I think?), which occurs in the context of a big multiverse that enables the GM to develop a campaign plot involving some sort of multi-dimensional Nazis (for whom the party promptly started working, because they pay better). He mixes influences skillfully, the game is still very clearly in the dungeon fantasy genre, and the individual occurrances and encounters and such are generally presented in a pleasing narrative style.<br/><br/>So, in a nutshell: the players fuzz over their own characters, the GM fuzzes over his setpiece adventure ideas, and then we reveal to each other what we've got, and appreciate the results of the GM's adventure situation interacting with the various player characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447311/#Comment_447311" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T13:51:25+00:00" title="July 28, 2015  1:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2015 2:20PM by komradebob.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, in a nutshell: the players fuzz over their own characters, the GM fuzzes over his setpiece adventure ideas, and then we reveal to each other what we've got, and appreciate the results of the GM's adventure situation interacting with the various player characters.</blockquote>\nSounds right to me. <br/><br/>I can also imagine "moments" when, temporarily, lightweight Narrativist or Gamist  activities get everyone jazzed up and add flavor to the activity, without coming to dominate the longer term agenda of the playgroup.<br/><br/>I do giggle a bit internally when you use the term <i>Princess Play</i>. Having said that, sometimes I really do prefer terms like it, or even some of the goofier jargon terms I've used regarding Sim play in the past. Stuff like "Verbal Costume Party" or "Advanced Play &amp; Pretend" and similar.<br/><br/>It's not because I'm hating on it. If anything, it's the opposite.<br/><br/>I do admit, I might be hating n Gamism and Narrativism a bit when I do it, however.<br/><br/>To me, an ongoing, successful Sim game has a parallel to a kids' Halloween Party. You dress up in your costume ( verbal creation, rather than a physical costume) and when you get to the party with your pals, the games played there are all themed to your costumes. And yeah, some challenges, and yeah, some portrayal of your character identity, but the fun is that you get to come back and do it over and over again ( unlike the Halloween Party, that happens one time a year).<br/><br/>I know, that's fairly culture specific.<br/><br/>But I think part of understanding the joy of Sim, and Sim generally. really des come from looking at it as <b>Play</b> first, and everything else second. If we can step back and do that, then we can start to delve back in and discuss, well, what supports that exactly, and how can it be formalized?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447314/#Comment_447314" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T16:43:22+00:00" title="July 28, 2015  4:43PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm with Bob on this as well - that all sounds familiar.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to return to that question about genre Sim vs. physics Sim and such: when I compare my experiences in GURPS with my experiences in Dead of Night (I haven't played very many Simmy games for any length of time through the last 15 years, so the same games pop up in my discussion constantly), I don't think that they're really that different. Both have a genre context, and GURPS does certainly have more character focus than DoN, which is very focused on setting, plot twists and narrative technique, but ultimately they feel the same, the same way two Narrativist games feel the same to me despite having all sorts of differences in techniques and topic and whatnot.<br/><br/>The big fat differences between those two games are that a horror game usually doesn't have a lot of that princessing emphasis going on (the characters are simple and ordinary), and that GURPS has a lot and lot of rules systematics; but as I described earlier, I think that the rules heaviness is just a presentation technique that enables the participants to appreciate the events from different angles (sort of like watching sports on-location or in the television), so it's not as fundamental a difference between the games as the character emphasis vs. situation emphasis thing is.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447317/#Comment_447317" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T18:55:08+00:00" title="July 28, 2015  6:55PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the fantastic actual play account, Eero.

And no, I don't think that I have anything supremely facile yet. I do have some ideas about running some princess Sim myself at some point, which might turn into an independent game and then the sort of "game theory by the way of design demonstration" game text we used to do at the Forge, but that's still ways off - I'm occupied by other stuff for who knows how long. Besides, I'd rather play Ars Magica right now if given the choice of Sims.<br/><br/>If you need to go do princess play right now, I recommend trying out a GMing approach where you try to actively guess at what it is that a player thinks cool about their character, and then give them situations where that coolness gets to be expressed. Help them express it (e.g. let them roll the dice and then describe the cool outcome yourself, if they're not the sort who relish talking themselves) and start with situations core to the character before moving out to stranger stuff (have Wolverine start with a bar fight before trying to see how he'll act at a wedding, that is). Ideally, use a rules system that can deal with interactivity of the environment and doing stuff without putting character success on the line in an inappropriate way - that's probably the single biggest stumbling block any princess play campaign has to resolve, what to do if the dice say you suck at the wrong moment and in the wrong way.<br/><br/>Regarding Dune and such setting commitment, I don't think that it is specifically a Sim thing - you could see that with any Creative Agenda that can leverage setting to be relevant to play in some way. My own at-table approach to the world of Near in the <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> has become more and more like that of one of those authors over time, and the same goes for Glorantha and such - basically, settings that do stuff for you creatively will have you commit creatively to deep setting immersion, and if it's relevant to the techniques and goals of the game, it'll show up in play as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447320/#Comment_447320" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-28T19:51:51+00:00" title="July 28, 2015  7:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While that's certainly true - just like lots of G or N-supporting techniques can be very handy in a Right to Dream game - you don't think there's anything particularly agenda-supportive about that approach?<br/><br/>Somehow, I imagine someone reading the World of Near (searching for that is quite hilarious, by the way, since it returns links to articles like "The end of the world is near!!!") and becoming so invested or interested in the source material as to attempt to drift the game.

So if your character is e.g. the Phantom (I dunno why him, just run with it), it would not be acceptable for him to fail in finding somebody hiding in an African harbor city, <i>unless</i> the GM did the legwork to establish that someone as an exceptional intelligence operative on their own right, a worthy foe for the Phantom. A simple "roll the dice and see what happens" task resolution system would not suffice for these purposes, as a bland "sometimes you succeed and sometimes you fail" resolution is not acceptable when the players are encouraged to have rock-hard preconceptions, a strong vision about what their character is like. That includes what sort of challenges they can fail at, and a lazy "I guess you rolled badly" does not cut it.<br/><br/>As can be seen, I could visualize many sorts of dicing schemes to better support princess play, apparently. Aside from resource-based systems where the player can decide what to fail at by e.g. spending points, you could also do a traditional task resolution system, except with the twist that the GM is only allowed to call for a roll when they've got the goods, or they're obligated to deliver the goods if a roll fails. Oh, you failed in that tracking roll? I guess your quarry is not merely Joe the Sailor, he's gotta be something more to be such a worthy foe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447341/#Comment_447341" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T14:26:47+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  2:26PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That reminds me of something I was working on a couple of years back, with various colors of blank dice.<br/><br/>It was a tiny bit like the Yes/and/but/no cards for Itras By/Archipelago, the ones that go a little further than just a combo of those four words.<br/><br/>The dice were coded by color, and the stickers were pretty small, so you could really only get a word or two in there.

How do we present a certain world, a certain vision, a certain type of story?<br/><br/>Most of the rules are all about a modeling of some sort, and, while most of it claims to be focused on "realism", there are lots of nods to "genre emulation", with special "mook" rules and "action hero" and so forth. <br/><br/>In addition, there is the whole very visible "genre pastiche" thing going on, with the game advertising itself in part as a game where yes, you actually <i>can</i> mash up these various genres successfully!<br/><br/>So, all those features could supporting a few (different) types of Sim play, or at least hint at them to the reader.<br/><br/>There's not much to say for Gamist support (in terms of the aims of the text; the mechanics themselves could certainly be used in this way, but there's no attempt to aim for "balance", and, for example, character creation often forces you into an awkward position where representing your character "faithfully" forces you to make inefficient decisions, like buying lots of background skills and how raising your attributes as high as possible saves you lots of points, even if it doesn't fit your vision of the character).<br/><br/>Same goes for premise-addressing: it's not clear at all how the game would help you with that, except perhaps a handful of the more unusual Disadvantages.<br/><br/>Something like the "Quirks" rules is a perfect example: they seem silly from a Gamist perspective, and hardly useful at all for a Narrativist perspective, but point at portraying a certain type of character, and providing the player with a small reward for doing so.<br/><br/>But to say I would reach for GURPS for this kind of play... I wouldn't.<br/><br/>Back when I tried really hard to aim for this kind of play priority*, I eventually found I had the best success with a very rules-light approach.<br/><br/>I used the <i>Fudge</i> system, in part because it allowed me, as GM, to shape the game to match my vision. There were almost no strict rules which could ruin my vision or go against it, and the players couldn't point to them and say something was wrong.<br/><br/>The way it worked was, basically, to outline all possible/believable outcomes of a possible situation, and then map them to the <i>Fudge</i> ladder. So, for instance, if, as Eero puts it, the Phantom is looking for someone in an African port, the best outcome is that he finds him quickly and is utterly under control of the situation ("Superb"); however, the worst possible is, perhaps, that the target is prepared for the Phantom, and finds him first instead ("Terrible"). Clearly, we can't have the Phantom failing to find someone altogether, so we don't include that in the range of possibilities.<br/><br/>(It might be completely different for a different character in the same situation, however, as befits that character's style and expected story tropes.)<br/><br/>This worked well for story-oriented priorities as well as "realism/modeling" priorities. (For example, I had different charts and systems for unarmed combat, armed combat, firearm combat, and so forth, although all were ultimately vague enough to allow appropriate interpretation in the moment, with us describing the outcome in a way which felt right to us. But a single, static "damage scale" like a game such as D&amp;D - or the default <i>Fudge</i> rules - clearly failed to generate the kinds of results which felt "right" or "realistic" in all situations.)<br/><br/>I ultimately stopped playing in this style because, in the end, as GM I was the one making all the calls. I wasn't planning ahead or railroading and *still* I found that the game lacked surprises for me, and always put me in the driving seat. These days I like much more clear mechanics, which allow all the players input in some way - and therefore don't allow any one person to steer the boat at all times.<br/><br/><br/>*: Sandra, this pertains to the GNS thing. Back when the Big Model was under constant discussion, it was understood that most people who were confused by CA modes, or couldn't identify them, felt that way because they had only ever played (successfully) in one mode. The idea was that those people got confused by the whole idea of CA modes because they were trying to identify all three "flavours" within a gaming history which only held one, and therefore found the whole concept hard to relate to.<br/><br/>Here's a good link to Vincent talking about it on his forums:<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=384.0" rel="nofollow">apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=384.0</a><br/><br/>For me, learning about the Big Model allowed me to open my horizons to explore other types of gaming (which otherwise would have been very "unnatural", or perhaps uncomfortable, without the proper tools and sense of creative goals). So after that, almost all of my dissatisfaction with gaming faded away, and I finally had the tools to enjoy any and all kind of RPG (and a with much broader cross-section of players and groups).<br/><br/>If you may allow me to sound like an idiot for a second, I would say: It sounds like you have some very strong feelings about identifying your play with a certain "agenda" or label, and it's causing you distress. (Otherwise, why would hearing that "GNS is dead" give you such relief?)<br/><br/>Let go of all that! It's just a theory, just a model. Like all theories and models, it's flawed and incomplete, and doesn't give you the full picture. It's not a religion you have to poke at and find true or untrue. Use it when it's useful to you, and don't use it when it gets in the way. <br/><br/>A lot of us here find it useful (even while acknowledging its limitations), and interesting to discuss, as in this thread - which I have, personally, found to be extremely fruitful. But there's no need to have some kind of emotional attachment to feeling a certain way or identifying with a certain label. Who cares? Certainly not I. No one can tell you how to play, or whether you're playing "right" or "wrong". Just have a good time! It doesn't matter whether a certain theory happens to be useful to someone else on the internet or not.<br/><br/>I hope you can take that in a constructive spirit. I'm trying to be helpful, even as I know I very likely missed that by a giant step or two.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447356/#Comment_447356" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T17:51:43+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  5:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question: when this thread transitioned from talking about Genre Emulation to talking about Princess Play Plus, did any useful commonalities persist?

(Although I could see, for instance, how in a Call of Cthulhu game we might be "celebrating" the badassness of the otherworldly threats instead of that of the investigators, for instance. But we would still be celebrating the investigators going crazy or some such thing, although that doesn't suit "Princess Play" per se. I've definitely played "Princess Play" games where some of the characters had self-destructive or tragic arcs which were nevertheless very important for the player to pursue on their own terms, and couldn't be challenged without it feeling like someone was "playing wrong".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447362/#Comment_447362" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T18:34:25+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  6:34PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2015 6:36PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>they also have so much overlap</blockquote>Anything you think you could enumerate?\n<blockquote>That whole "celebrating character features" stuff seems very central to both "princess play" and "genre emulation".</blockquote>Hmm.

If you have a strong genre and it's a genre that supports the notion of princess characters, such as superheroes, then there's no reason why a game couldn't do both at once - it's part of the genre for the game to celebrate the ultimate coolness that is the Phantom (really, he's like the coolest superhero, and Defenders of the Earth the coolest superhero team in the history of American superheroing).<br/><br/>However, if the game is something like say <i>Werewolf: the Apocalypse</i>, then its basic conceit of what it is to play is still 100% princess-y, but also much, much less genre-informed; it's gestulating wildly at the meta-genres of adventure fiction and urban fantasy mostly, but the real core is to have its own setting that supports <i>authentic</i> adventure drama - authentic in the sense of building from cornerstone up yourself, without being strongly pre-constrained by specific genre choices unless you choose to. Basically the same as <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, just somewhat less pointed on the genre - one of them's an adventure game and the other's a pulp adventure game with emphasis on the adventure over the pulp, which you know doesn't make for that great of a difference between the two in practice.<br/><br/>All that is to answer David by the way of saying that "genre" and "princessing" here are functional lenses through which we get a handle on the creative, social, psychological mechanics of what's going on in a given game. Similar to how some Narrativist games are "protagonist advocation" games and some Gamist games are "mission-based", but that's not the whole story of what's going on with the creative agenda mode. I guess one could call these "creative agenda strategies" or "patterns"; they're not agenda modes in the GNS sense, but rather structures of how the game goes about satisfying the agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447367/#Comment_447367" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T19:25:34+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  7:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2015 7:26PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whether I agree or disagree with that analysis depends on what you mean "princessing".

"We reveal to each other what we've got" (as per your GURPS game) says nothing about the standards for appreciating such contributions.

I'd say that it would, pretty much by definition, require the other players to appreciate your character. If the players are just focused on their own characters and merely allow others to have the spotlight because you got to, not because they want to, then it's by definition of the term incoherent play.<br/><br/>For example, in our GURPS game, insofar as I understand, the other players have been slightly bemused about my approach of not min-maxing equipment and combining silent, seeming passivity with proactive willingness to pull the group's collective asses out of the fire in dangerous situations. After the say 8 sessions or so that we played over the spring season (the game's been on hiatus during the summer, I don't quite know what the GM is planning schedule-wise) an expectation pretty much grew for me to fuzz around in seemingly suboptimal ways in combat, poking fun at the 1 second GURPS combat round (an infinite jest if you ask me), only to pull off a brutal, tactically decisive move at the right moment. (Anything ranging from sneakily jumping down on top of an enemy to running up and delivering a Fist of the Northstar style finishing blow to simply throwing them down and sitting on them - a very effective approach in a realistic combat system in many situations, I might add.)<br/><br/>The other players have certainly appreciated my effectiveness in this regard - the GURPS martial artist mechanics sort of synergize with my characterization of the character (technical details, but there's stuff like spending time in concentration to amass your qi energies before executing a high-performance feat) and make "tactical reserve" the proper tactical role for the character, so it makes for an interesting combination of seeming cluelessness and actual usefulness when the character reacts to combats and such by climbing into a tree and spending 10 combat rounds merely getting into position.<br/><br/>It's worked well, because I've also found that I enjoy being sort of a hero in the group - it's a very flashy position to be "the cavalry", as it leaves my own character seemingly untouchably cool, being the one who didn't have to distract the enemy for half a minute while the monk sat in a tree waiting for his moment. I imagine that this is entirely routine for some roleplayers as a source of enjoyment, but it's been pretty peculiar for me, because it's such a... simmy thing to be enjoying. I know that it's artificial (I mean in comparison to e.g. a Gamist game that'd strive for absolute authenticity in "heroism", not consistent depiction as here), but it being emergent (there's no tactical role support in-built in GURPS or anything, this is just how the group's tactical action has settled as a combination of character builds, combat rules and player choices) and unvoiced (nobody planned for it or even described it in so many words before now) makes it interesting nevertheless as a discovery brought about by our process of Exploration - I discovered that a hanger-on character I created to fill a seat is basically the hero of the team, without whom the rest of the jokers would be thoroughly lacking in hard-hitting stopping power.<br/><br/>Similarly, I think we've been pretty functional about appreciating the other players' characters: the sadistic barbarian-ranger gets lambasted for wanting to torture prisoners and such (that's basically a schoolbook example of what Simmy appreciation could look like - you acknowledge the impression the player was going for, in this case that his character is an unstable sociopath, and have your own character react appropriately); the players all joke about the cleric with supposedly high moral standards but convenient justifications for getting extremely well along with evil Nazis; everybody listens with at least some slight interest in the calculations the wizard player makes about his character sitting in a wagon during travel to read books, to get those 1 character point / 200 hours of study skill bonuses. Even the self-deprecating goblin thief gets his laughs for being small and clever and a vaguely fantasy-racist caricature - his schtick is sort of similar to mine in some respects, as his skills also work well in solo exploits, which has encouraged our characters to specifically interact some in sneaky commando stuff.<br/><br/>What I said about the sadistic steppe barbarian there might be a key to understanding how two princess players cohere against each other creatively, without even particularly needing a GM in the recipe: they both understand the other's character in some manner (not important to get it exactly right to begin with, it's a process of learning as you play), and acknowledge that understanding by reflecting it in their own characterization, therefore getting an opportunity to show off their own character as well. The oft-cited X-Men example of Wolverine vs. Cyclops is basically this: Wolverine by being savage gives Cyclops a chance to show responsible leadership, and Cyclops by being a stick in the mud gives Wolverine a chance to show rebel spirit; therefore their interaction is useful for both players, and amply justifies playing together instead of everybody sitting in their own closet imagining themselves as superheroes.<br/><br/>And yes, all this seems like it's basically what those wacky freeform forum rpgs are about, insofar as I understand them: having your character vision, showing it out, and if you're really lucky, meeting somebody who both understands your character and has an interesting one of their own that, when brought into interaction with yours, causes pretty sparks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447380/#Comment_447380" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T20:31:06+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  8:31PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>And yes, all this seems like it's basically what those wacky freeform forum rpgs are about, insofar as I understand them: having your character vision, showing it out, and if you're really lucky, meeting somebody who both understands your character and has an interesting one of their own that, when brought into interaction with yours, causes pretty sparks.</blockquote>\nNicely put.<br/><br/>But where, then does the line (of difference? of similarity?) lie in regards to genre emulation play? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447381/#Comment_447381" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T20:37:35+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  8:37PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about Chuubo's you guys? the pretty sparks is even an xp trigger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447382/#Comment_447382" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T20:46:53+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  8:46PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How about Chuubo's you guys? the pretty sparks is even an xp trigger</blockquote>\nI'm not familiar - is it a game?\n<blockquote>But where, then does the line (of difference? of similarity?) lie in regards to genre emulation play? </blockquote>\nWell, as I said earlier, I'm not personally convinced that these are really so much different things as they are different lenses, models, patterns of interpreting a complex human phenomenon. We see an elephant and one says that it's got a trunk, another says that it's got a tail, and both are right. Some of these elephants we have here just have smaller trunks or their tails have been cut, that's all.<br/><br/>I guess that we can point at games that don't have practically any princessing in them at all, such as many horror games; likewise we can point at games that are not informed by a very clear genre stricture of expectation, such as say Ars Magica (which has a lot going on it, but a genre's not one of those things). The "line" between the two isn't truly much of a line, though, as there are also plenty of games that include both creative agenda phenomena in prominent place. I see no reason to try to somehow forcibly interpret <i>Spirit of the Century</i> as <i>either</i> a game that celebrates pulp fiction tropes <i>or</i>  a game that encourages the players to develop unique, idiosyncratic protagonist dolls to play with. Why would one think that a game couldn't be both of these at once?<br/><br/>That whole question looks to me like if somebody asked what the difference between a protagonist advocation Narrativist game was compared to a scenario-focused blood opera. It's just a strange question to ask about two common patterns of Narrativist game arrangement that often occur together, but can also make an appearance independently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447383/#Comment_447383" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T20:47:05+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  8:47PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Why does it cause big arguments?</blockquote>\nIt's a feeling of loss. You had something that could meaningfully explain a difference in thinking and perspective, and then that clarity is ripped away from you since the other party interprets the model in a way completely incompatible with your own view.<br/><br/>It's like arguing about lawful evil and stuff like that.<br/>I was in a flamewar on big purple about that. He held strong Chaotic Good values in real life, so he was like "Lawful Neutral is Evil, how can someone not see that?"<br/><br/>I was like "Lawful Neutral means 'I hate chaotic with all my heart but I don't care about the battle between good or evil. I might do good things, I might do evil things, it doesn't matter to me', while Lawful Evil means "I hate chaotic and I damn sure hate good! I will consciously strive to do evil things!"<br/><br/>But he was like "not caring about good or evil, that is evil!".<br/><br/>I was frustrated because something that once was crisp and clear (the nine point alignment system) was all of a sudden something that just caused more arguments, more misunderstanding...<br/>I overhear "my" players argue about alignments so much. All theoretical, it's never caused a problem in our group (I'm pretty pro pvp and flashlight dropping so...)<br/>I'm always like "Forget about alignments and focus on your Ideal."<br/><br/><br/>In the same way, it used to bother me that "simulationism" now includes Theatrix, Wushu and Fiasco -- it's been a long journey from the division into "drama-based games" and "world-based games".

class="Message">\n                            Eero, do you think, "I'll have a vision for my guy, I'll try to entertain everyone with it; they have visions to show me too, and I'll try to be entertained," constitutes a creative agenda?  I mean, I'm seeing a functional way for people to have fun together, sure, but I'm not seeing any sort of creative drives and goals.  One can succeed or fail at putting a cool spin on B Movie Horror, one can expend effort in that direction, one can judge and be judged accordingly.  But, "Hey look at this!  Do you like it?" doesn't seem to fulfill those criteria.<br/><br/>I think your example of the combat-useful eccentric martial artist is telling -- your interface with the rest of the group is based less on whether your eccentricity looks cool, and more on whether your combat contributions add to the situation (with the eccentricity as context for that).  You personally may be focused on "my princess" during play, but it wouldn't work socially if the situations of play didn't align the group's interest with your contributions.  In other words, no fighty missions = irrelevant ninja princess.<br/><br/>If genre emulation is the unifying feature in our first case, I don't think princess play is its analog in our second.  The feature that unites princess play is something more like princess <i>teamwork</i>.  Or... I dunno, like that but broader?  Hmm.  I am trying to imagine whether a game of "each princess on their own" is even viable the way many Narr "each protagonist on their own" games are, and I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Princess application?  (Like, "Here's a thing we care about, apply your princess to <i>that</i>."  As opposed to the sort of princess play that groups hate, where everyone pursues stuff that doesn't interest everyone else.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447393/#Comment_447393" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-29T21:42:20+00:00" title="July 29, 2015  9:42PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm not necessarily following your train of thought here. Sounds to me like you're saying that playing with action figures or dolls doesn't have a creative agenda, when to me it's pretty obvious that it does.<br/><br/>I don't see the character portrayal and combat effectiveness as separate aspects of my GURPS character. The character I'm portraying is whatever he happens to be as a combination of my (originally rather ironic and detached) whims and the game's rules system, and the combat effectiveness is a discovered emergent property. It's not at the root of the character's relevance to the other players, it's just how that relevance happens to substantiate. I could easily imagine a different system application where the emergent truth about my character was that "martial artists suck, isn't it hilarious how useless Eero's character is despite all the earnest trying". (The experienced GURPS'ists in the group have told me that the martial artist archetype is generally considered rather weak in GURPS - I've no idea what they're about based on what I've seen, but maybe it's got something to do with the specific campaign context.)<br/><br/>The creatively significant issue, I think, is whether your character has <i>presence</i> at all in the game, and whether it's a consistent thing under your control, and pleasing for you. The other players are crucial to this, to bringing vague internal ideas and whims into an acknowledged, created reality at the game table. Failure looks like being a non-entity: your character may technically be present, but nothing you say strikes a particularly vivid image, nobody gets a sense of the role you're portraying, and so on.<br/><br/>Regarding unifying features, I don't think I understand what interpreting genre emulation as such means. Is it just that it's an unitary creative goal for the players at the table to work at together? If that's it, then I agree that princess play by itself seems like an unlikely goal - it's not a goal, it's a value feature facilitated by other aspects of play. You do your legwork, and if everything goes well, at the end you have a robust dollhouse (a campaign) in which you can place your doll (character) without the floor falling out, and then you can play together. The unifying feature that presumably motivates the players is the interest in working on the same sort of dollhouse together, so as to have other people to play with, and therefore other characters for your character to interact with, and other people acknowledging whatever it is that your character is.<br/><br/>If I had to guess, I'd say that "each princess on their own" will basically work if the players want it to - if they're interested in the setting and the character and the content in general enough to make it work. Consider the peculiar sort of troupe play in Ars Magica, it certainly seems to believe in the feasibility of you all leaving your princess dolls (mages) home and playing support cast for my princess who's got this highly character-specific adventure lined up. I guess that if this works for people creatively, as I understand it to do, that would imply that people are indeed capable of putting aside their monomaniacal focus on their own characters for a while to enjoy the other opportunities playing together with a collective dollhouse brings. If I had to guess, I'd say that it works for Ars because the game's got a lot of stuff going all bundled up in its creative agenda - there's discovery of emergent outcomes from the complex rules system, there's celebration of medieval history, there's hardcore dollhouse building and princess play - so the players have options as to things that could potentially perk their interest, all in ways that are at least potentially cohesive with what the other players are interested in.<br/><br/>In comparison, a similar arrangement would probably not work in the stereotypical superhero game, with its highly princess-focused creative value proposition. I <i>could</i> see myself setting aside my own princess in something like the Marvel universe to indulge in a bit of general world-building and such, just because it has such a comparatively rich mythology and history as a setting, but in your average superhero game there just isn't anything there for me except my own character and his relationships with the setting and other characters. If you want me to be interested, you'll want to engage me through my character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447396/#Comment_447396" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-30T03:48:57+00:00" title="July 30, 2015  3:48AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2015 3:54AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>if everything goes well, at the end you have a robust dollhouse (a campaign) in which you can place your doll (character) without the floor falling out, and then you can play together. The unifying feature that presumably motivates the players is the interest in working on the same sort of dollhouse together . . .</blockquote>Yeah, that's pretty much where I was going with that.  Your martial artist is viable in this campaign because he can contribute to the goings-on of this particular dollhouse in a relevant way, whether that's effectiveness or hilarious ineptitude (not that every dollhouse would work equally well with each).  A dollhouse full of missions and toys that allow our dolls to show what they can do is vital; I think princess play often fails when character-creation and situation-creation don't mesh, as in the case of a combat-heavy Rifts adventure that doesn't care that some OCCs are so much better at combat than others as to render those others useless.\n<blockquote>. . . so as to have other people to play with, and therefore other characters for your character to interact with, and other people acknowledging whatever it is that your character is.</blockquote>It seems to me that the bar is a little higher than that.  I'd say that working with the right combo of dolls and dollhouse not only allows us to interact, but sets us up with some decent odds of caring about that interaction (as opposed to, as you said, the situation where "nothing I say particularly strikes anyone at the table").<br/><br/>Maybe "the right dollhouse" means a fictional scenario where the princesses can strut their stuff, or maybe it means something more.  What do you think?  If it includes some sort of aesthetic standards, then perhaps I'd see the overlap with genre emulation; otherwise, perhaps not.<br/><br/>Let's say the group is all together fighting a badguy, and your ninja shows up and ineptly flails at the enemy.  When is this a cause for laughter, and when do you get ignored?  What's the difference between those two cases?  It clearly isn't just the facts of the badguy fight; there's something about the group's focus and taste in there too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447527/#Comment_447527" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T15:07:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  3:07PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2015 3:30PM by komradebob.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote></blockquote>\nIt's the of type questions in this last bit of your post that were making me wonder earlier about the usefulness of social feedback methods/mechanics in Sim Play of all kinds.<br/><br/>The easiest social feedback mechanics* I can point to are the ones in Matthijs Holter's <i>Archipelago</i>. Here I'm thinking of the key phrases used in that game. Stuff like "More detail, please" and so on.**<br/><br/>In use, they are part of an ongoing process of very gently bringing the "vision" of the (celebrated/group-created) source material together. IMO, the fact that anyone can use them aids in this gelling process.<br/><br/>Does this sort of thing have a more broad application to Sim play?<br/><br/><br/>* As always, apologies for adding jargon.<br/><br/>** Archipelago also has some other Sim supportive gelling mechanics, like individual player ownership of certain setting aspects. Okay, not exactly ownership, but a bit like "expert status, so we defer to that person's vision when a question about [Aspect X] comes up in play".  And those individual setting aspects are split up among the playgroup.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447528/#Comment_447528" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T15:59:41+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  3:59PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting idea. What does an explicit acknowledgement mechanism do for a roleplaying game, anyway? It seems to me like it does something across all sorts of agendas, but what that something is gets somewhat difficult to describe - or perhaps it varies so much across situations, as the reactions of various groups in different situations to explicit acknowledgement of contribution varies.<br/><br/>For example, I've played a lot of games where moment-to-moment relevant contribution is taken for granted from players with whom you've established a working relationship, and in those games e.g. fan mail mechanisms would be thoroughly redundant and disinteresting. However, I've also played many games where contributing is difficult, nobody knows in advance if we're able to navigate this creative maze, and it is very relevant for players to express clearly when they feel that another player has struck gold, so to speak.<br/><br/>The examples I'm thinking in this regard are all Nar or Gam, though, so maybe one could say something more generally applicable about what acknowledgement mechanics do for Sim games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447529/#Comment_447529" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T16:27:59+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  4:27PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some Sim games have tried acknowledgment mechanics, it's just that they borrowed them from more Gamist type games, leading to a bit of incoherence.<br/><br/>As an example, old WW games where you got XPs for playing, and bonus XPs for Good Roleplaying. I'd say those were an attempt at acknowledgement mechanics.<br/><br/>The problem? What if I don't care about my character getting mechanically more powerful at all? For that matter, why have them solely in the hands of the GM?<br/><br/>The Karma points in FASERIP might also be an early attempt at acknowledgment mechanics. Do things that a Four Colors Superhero odes, get points for it ( or lose them for acting out of genre), and it makes it more likely for your character to be more effective at doing Four Color Supers type stuff. Acknowledgment that your portrayal of character is well inside the genre and that you understand the genre you're collectively embracing.<br/><br/>Eero, I think t's interesting you've noted that things like fan mail just aren't that important when you've got a group that is already working well.<br/><br/>Maybe these sorts of acknowledgment mechanics are best as training wheels?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447538/#Comment_447538" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T20:50:01+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  8:50PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found some value simply in the presence of a reminder that "this aspect of play matters".

But could some of this idea be taken further? What form would it take? Who has access to it?<i> When </i>do they get it?  Where does it "live" during play? On the table? In front of players? Tacked to a wall?<br/><br/>Further, what about the stuff beyond the mechanical? The inspirational fictional stuff. What about that?<br/><br/>Despite how much we communicate through this electronic medium, when we think games, we still tend to envision a book. Maybe breaking up this stuff in some fashion for distribution to the playgroup is more useful for giving the play group a jump start on gelling the vision?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447553/#Comment_447553" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-02T18:41:03+00:00" title="August  2, 2015  6:41PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely.
