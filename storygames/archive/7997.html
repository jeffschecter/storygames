The economy is in turmoil! Troubled economic times! The Second Great Depression!<br/>2. Lulu just raised their costs pretty dramatically! Dammit!<br/>3. It's Halloween! Candy! Costumes! Parties! Too many girls who think it's clever to dress like Sarah Palin!<br/><br/>Conclusion: Time for a holiday sale! I'm slashing prices on Dread and Pent by 20%. Crux is sold at cost (no profit), so I can't lower the prices on that one (though I would if I could).
