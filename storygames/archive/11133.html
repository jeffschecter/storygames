Sauron's weakness is the One Ring; H. G. Wells' Martians are vulnerable to bacteria; the Death Star has a thermal exhaust vent.<br/><br/>But we rarely see it in roleplaying games. In investigative games, you might sometimes find a ritual to banish a monster. But you don't just banish it. There'll always be some threat; some twist in the tale; some reason you can't just tick the ritual box and save the world.<br/><br/>In fighting games, it's even harder. It would be really unsatisfying to walk into the dragon's lair, stab it with the ancient sword and see it die. There's got to be a battle first. We want to fight the dragon and, only at the last minute, when all seems lost, exploit its weakness.<br/><br/>But how could that work, mechanically? Is it even possible?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247283/#Comment_247283" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T07:51:37+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  7:51AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, there is a mechanic that is used in some games to do this, it's called "hit points".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247284/#Comment_247284" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T07:54:35+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  7:54AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 7:55AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it is because most roleplaying games are absolutely predicated on conflict.

It's side-stepping something fun, though, as you point out.<br/><br/>The weak spot can be a switch - for example, maybe the dragon reaching zero hit points actually represents finally, after grueling and dangerous hours of maneuvering, getting the one chance to send Black Arrow home. I'm not sure this is much better...<br/><br/>In Solar System you might tie the weakness to Transcendence.<br/><br/>EDIT: JD Corley everybody, he'll be here all week...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247288/#Comment_247288" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T08:17:01+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  8:17AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The classic way of handling this that I've seen is that the monster is normally unbeatable, so you go on a quest (or a series of quests) to obtain the artifact(s)/secret(s)/spirit(s) that destroys the monster/makes the monster vulnerable to normal weapons/does a zillion points of damage a round to the monster.

About the closest good example I can think of is the use of silver against lycantrhopes and vampires in D&amp;D.  It's a weakness that isn't Death-Star-esque.

You can *try* to stake a vampire any time you want - if the damage you do, multiplied by 5, would be enough to take the vampire to zero then they're dusted instantly. If not, they just take normal damage, and are probably upset with you. So, it's best to "soften them up" with conventional attacks before going for the big finish.<br/><br/>In more story-gamey terms, maybe you have to build up a certain number of victories before you can exploit the weakness. Sure, we know where the thermal exhaust vent on the Death Star is, but getting close enough to attack it requires getting past the gun towers and all those pesky TIE fighters. Plus, every time you lose a dice throw on the way, you lose a wingman. Rest in peace, Porkins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247292/#Comment_247292" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T08:33:14+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  8:33AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 9:52AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Esoterror FactBook introduces the idea of the Special Means of Despatch - a weakness that you may or may not discover through play, that is, it's not a core clue.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>The classic way of handling this that I've seen is that the monster is normally unbeatable, so you go on a quest (or a series of quests) to obtain the artifact(s)/secret(s)/spirit(s) that destroys the monster/makes the monster vulnerable to normal weapons/does a zillion points of damage a round to the monster.

Star Wars isn't essentially about the universe of space combat, although it wears its trappings.<br/><br/>I remember an early draft of Contenders that essentially had a "push this button to win the boxing contest" feature; not sure if it's still around in the published version.  But it works there to the extent that Contenders is not really an unarmed martial combat simulator.<br/><br/>I think (but I'm not entirely sure) that the endgame of My Life With Master sorta plays out like this:  it's not all "Your Minion strikes another 5 hit points from the Master."<br/><br/>On the other hand we've got movies like Predator, which are definitely all about "human tries to kill alien" and most of the movie revels in that.  There's no magic "kill monster" button per se; there's a slow war of reconnaissance and attrition.<br/><br/>So I think it's just an issue of focus and what the game is trying to deliver.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247296/#Comment_247296" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T09:01:21+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  9:01AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's an interesting thought.

So fighting the monster essentially comes down to rolling the dice until the monster (or you) dies. Exploiting the weakness means <i>not </i> engaging those mechanics and thus defeating the monster in a different way. To my mind, traditional games are all about this division. In fact, a lot of games now have this as an explicit part of the game.<br/><br/>In Storming the Wizards Tower, every encounter has a weakness by design, period. It's there to give the characters an alternate path to victory. You will probably use the same mechanics, but the fiction of the weakness means you might use different actions, spells, resources, and so on.<br/><br/>Poison'd has a set of "fight" mechanics and a set of "non-fight" mechanics. If, say, I roll sneakyness to steal the Bosun's pistols before I get into a fight with him, I'm creating a weakness to exploit. 3:16 similarly has a stat for fighting and a stat for everything else.<br/><br/>In a lot of OD&amp;D, you can easily encounter a monster that simply can't be killed normally. A randomly encountered wolf pack may as well be the Death Star for a first level character. The game then becomes all about looking for a weakness to exploit so you can survive. About half the time this weakness turns out to be "if you set them on fire with a flask of oil they die!"  Also, many of these games have no specific mechanics for this, which can create a lot of problems. Ben Lehman's HQRPG is specifically designed to exploit the situation of the overwhelming threat to drive thoughtful play.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4.0 has the skill challenge, which can readily be applied as a mechanic for exploiting the weakness. Mind you, because of the way D&amp;D 4.0 is structured, you are less likely to need to do so unless the DM specifically sets up the encounter to require it.<br/><br/>Exploiting the weakenss can still be difficult! A vampire is a pretty bad ass foe for a low level D&amp;D character even if that character knows the weaknesses of vampires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247310/#Comment_247310" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T10:25:16+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 10:25AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>But we rarely see it in roleplaying games.</blockquote>\nUh, Agon?

That underlines <i>Storming</i>'s commitment to maps \u2014 which, in the game's terms, means any kind of information tool, like an orally-transmitted history, or a tapestry depicting a legendary battle, or a memorable, boozy conversation with a washed-up old adventurer at a tavern. The weakness is supposed to reflect the monster's theme, and discovering and exploiting it entails telling a story around that theme.<br/><br/>Other games have said it's OK to defeat the bad guys by being clever, but then not provided mechanical support.

If a vampire's vulnerable only to silver weapons, you just find a silver weapon, and proceed as before. If certain weapons do extra damage, then it's still a combat. It's a mild weakness, not an Achilles heel.<br/><br/>In a story, you'd have to fight for a while, waiting for the monster to expose the weakness, before you could exploit. If, in 4th Edition D&amp;D, you had to get under the dragon before you could stab it in the underbelly, that might be interesting.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247333/#Comment_247333" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T11:15:18+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 11:15AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skill Challenge, then, if you don't want to engage the tactical combat rules (in which, I agree, hit points model the "work up to the key, killing blow" notion of a weakness).<br/><br/>Find Weakness in Hero System--doesn't matter what it is (unless the target literally has a Vulnerability--different situation), if you find it, you get bonuses to rolls.

I almost forgot that you can do exactly this in <i>Storming</i>, using the Fight While Paying Attention maneuver. It allows you to gather different kinds of battlefield intelligence, possibly including monster details, as you accumulate successes. That game is full of learning/knowing mechanics! The way this might work: you (PCs) have been fighting tree-bears for a round and they are really tough, so the fight is not going in your favor. Next round, some of you Fight While Paying Attention. I (the GM) know, from monster creation, that my monsters have a mobility restriction, that they have to keep one root-leg immersed in water. If the PCs get enough (and there's rules guidance on "enough") Paying Attention successes, I have to tell them about the weakness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247376/#Comment_247376" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T13:23:36+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  1:23PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 1:24PM by Nathan_H.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about this bit lately, the not-fighting before the fighting, while watching the Rankin/Bass version of the Hobbit.

Broad categories are<br><br><strong>Weak Point:</strong> requires the player master the game's controls and identify movement patterns or "tells" to time shots so that they hit the Weak Point.<br><br><strong>Damage Type Weakness:</strong> requires the player manage various ways of dealing damage, and then determine through experimentation or research what kind of attacks are most effective.<br><br>Of the two, the second adapts most easily to RPGs since it's largely resource allocation and creative thinking, as opposed to a feat of dexterity.<br/><br/>As a weird experiment in a D&amp;D-like fight, you could have the GM and the players play a game of Mastermind during combat, each player making an attempt during their turn. When a player uncovers the GM's pattern, the monster's weak point is exposed that round and struck for massive damage or killed instantly or what have you. But standard critical hit rules are supposed to cover this stuff.<br/><br/>"Getting under the dragon" would require only that the mechanics of the game make attaining position an interesting challenge, which is why you see it all the time in video games. The flanking rules of D&amp;D 3e get at this a little bit, too. Abstract positioning, and you eventually get back to "hit points," which are just a count-down clock to monster death. Maybe 15 damage = got into a better position for your next strike in the game narrative, so in the end your character only hit the dragon once as far as fiction is concerned.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247447/#Comment_247447" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T02:45:53+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  2:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what you need is the right mix of player skill and chance.

Build your character right, and utilize his/her offensive and defensive advantages to stay in the fight long enough.<br/>\n- Being in the right position when the weakness is exposed: Stay close to the monster, make sure the monster can't run away, don't be behind the monster when its belly is exposed.<br/>\n- Having the right weapon/macguffin. You can't confront the Final Boss Monster before you've managed to find the macguffin, which requires thinking and skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could roll dice every round of combat, for example, to see if the weakness is exposed. Then, if your character is conscious and in the right place and has the right weapon, they might be able to kill it. If not, more combat rounds, and the real threat of death or other severe loss.
