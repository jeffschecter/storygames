It is a massive, somewhat flabby, but very immersive space opera game and a lot of the players clearly get off on the politics and roleplaying aspects of it.<br/><br/>I've had two thoughts about how you might enhance that further. The first was simply to have each player introduce an event or scene a la <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">Microscope</a> at the start of each round. You couldn't be as timey-wimey as you can with Microscope, but it would be a nice way of framing (and hopefully influencing) the activity within each round. Maybe have the speaker at the end of each round introduce a legacy?<br/><br/>The other would be to break off from the game completely at mid point and run a full <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpg/4467/archipelago" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> style game, with each player playing a senator representing one of the major races at a peace summit.<br/><br/>Needless to say, both elements would make an extremely long game even longer, but I guess if you're in for a penny you might as well lob in the full pound. And if you have a bank holiday weekend to spare...<br/><br/>Has anyone ever tried adding more story game elements to Twilight Imperium? I'd be interested to know how you got on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy" title="ParadoxBoy"><img alt="ParadoxBoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy">ParadoxBoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408655/#Comment_408655" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T12:41:15+00:00" title="March 10, 2013 12:41PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't tried <i>Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy</i>, it scratches a lot of the strategic itches <i>TI</i> goes after, but in a much more streamlined way; the shorter play time might allow for a group to insert roleplaying around the turn structure if so inclined.

I think I might try that option sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>I just really like the idea of characters arguing over the foreign policies of each other's empires, which would very much resonate with players who had just spent the previous few hours slogging it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408657/#Comment_408657" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T12:44:04+00:00" title="March 10, 2013 12:44PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you haven't tried <i>Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy</i>, it scratches a lot of the strategic itches <i>TI</i> goes after, but in a much more streamlined way; the shorter play time might allow for a group to insert roleplaying around the turn structure if so inclined.</blockquote>\nI'll investigate, thanks.<br/><br/>I've also been thinking about a BSG mashup.

There's an alliance/betrayal mechanic with VP consequences, for instance. The way play progresses also encourages active table talk, too, particularly with players whose territory is not connected to yours. The one place where the RAW discourage such play is that even allies can't coexist peacefully in a hex, and I gather that a "rule zero solution" would not be as satisfying to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408678/#Comment_408678" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T17:56:18+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  5:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes I would just bust out a narrative of just what happened when an Action Card get's played or a Distant Sun Token gets revealed.
