We wanted to get the full feel of the ORE system, so we went for one roll characters and a one roll company. The next time, I'd probably do the company first and then set a few dice for character roll-up so that the characters fit the company envisioned, but in our case, things worked out quite fine.<br/><br/>In the days before we played, the others popped some ideas about what they wanted to play, thirty years war, the black guard and a siege scenario were mentioned. I went into the game unprepared, having the chance of the dice rolls lead the way to adventure.<br/><br/>The players had a blast with One Roll Characters. All of us have a fondness for life path systems, although we're all more used to more elaborate setups (Artesia, for example). Two of the three players, J and T, rolled highly similar life paths, so they decided to play twins. The third player had a somewhat different character, but we had no problem tying the three together with a shared past. Since all of them came up with the "abled sailor" or better result, they opted for a pirate scenario. This was a fateful decision, since I had acquired the news Pirate's Guide to Freeport in pdf form only two days before that.<br/><br/>REIGN and Freeport mix well. In case you don't know; the PGtF is  a systemless source book Green Ronin put out recently to build upon it's adventure and setting line (they plan to make system support booklets, so they won't be bitten again when D&amp;D gets a new edition). It has rough sketches of a game world in case people don't know where to place an island with a pirate/trader port on their game world's map, and has just enough information to proxy as a generic fantasy world.<br/><br/>I started in medias res and had the players run into an ambush of two dozen mooks while they were underway on a sabotage mission to stop the elven longship to leave the  harbor the very next morning. At first I hesitated to send two dozen mooks against a group of three PCs, but with a bit of Lie and Intimidate, those two dozen were two halved dozens before anyone reached combat distance ("You just lead the charge brother, you won't last very long with the blue pox anyway!"). The rest of the mooks were easily dispatched by the spear wielding officer and singing herald on one side, and the dodgy twins on the other. Morale of this scene: If you want mooks to be effective, take at least ten per PC, they will thin out quickly! In other words: The mook rules work, and make for heroic entrances.<br/><br/>After a bit of intimidating interviewing, our little band of maritime ne'er-do-wells stole a boat and rammed it into the steering rig of the elven longship, just to realize the sturdy boat they were in was in fact a smuggler boat with a lot of hidden compartments, so it broke apart under their feet. With a bit of jumping and acrobatics, two of the guys got to the quay, while the other struggled a bit. Their flight from the docks was less than heroic, and one of the ship's guard managed a lucky slash across the younger twins' face \xe2\u20ac\u201c two wound boxes of killing damage to the head turned a funny-happy situation into an "uh-oh" moment \xe2\u20ac\u201c the transition from mook fight to minor npc fight was quite intense (on another note, I could have send another thirty mooks with about the same amount of danger, but we already had that, and I wanted a bit of a real fight).<br/><br/>Thus ended the first third of the game, the second third had a bit of sneaking and stealing action, also a part where passions came into play (one of the twins realized his brother's true love \xe2\u20ac\u201c or was it his? they couldn't agree \xe2\u20ac\u201c was in town, out for vengeance, but his passion was to find true love\xe2\u20ac\xa6 maybe she really loved him after all!), but the group decided to go bust some orc pirate nests along the elven kingdom's coasts (yeah, they had evidence the elvish kingdom collaborated with the orcs to go against freeport). Thus started the final third of the session. With two coffers of gold, a slave galley, and maps of the orcs' hideouts, they went to the first two orc tribes and convinced them the elves had been meaning to sell the orcs' position to Freeport to improve the diplomatic relationship between both nations, and also that the other three orcs had known of this plan and would be given the remains of these two tribes.<br/><br/>With this setup, they went out and raided three other orc harbors, effectively killing the orc pirate problem at it's roots. The last third was dominated by highly creative planning on the players' part and culminated on a total of seven company-level rolls which showed us how good the plan worked (it was flawlessly!).<br/><br/>Conclusion: The players loved their characters and played against usual type when the One Roll Character generation showed them other ways, we had loads of fun, and the conclusion of the adventure with the company rolls (and a bit of rough sailing/rowing the galley through a storm to get rid of the repaired elven longship that was waiting to get the guys at sea) was highly satisfying. Great game!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79180/#Comment_79180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T19:14:17+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  7:14PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I think that you just sold me on REIGN <i>and</i> Freeport!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79190/#Comment_79190" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T23:44:50+00:00" title="July  2, 2007 11:44PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mission accomplished.<br/><br/><br/>Be aware though, that I adlibbed a lot regarding the Freeport background. I mixed and matched stuff so that it fit the players' ideas (which is just the thing to do for a testing one-shot); i.e. I used names and positions of freeport npcs, but gave great leeway regarding their background. Two times I consciously fought the urge of saying "but it's totally different here in this book, let's do it <i>their</i> way." Both times, we did it <i>our</i> way, which helped things greatly. One of the players also wasn't really content with  some detail and shortcut a round of changing stuff realizing that it's only for a one shot; his character wouldn't need the perfect long time investment setup; I think he would have continued playing this character just the way he was after the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79201/#Comment_79201" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T03:39:36+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  3:39AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This, plus Judd's Forgotten Realms hack of the One Roll Character Generator, have really impressed me with the potential for incorporating setting-concepts into character creation in a funky way.
