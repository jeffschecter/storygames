                    Let me preface this by saying I was pondering this before seeing the Island of Lost Toys actual play postings....<br/><br/>Watching The Lost Room earlier this week (I loves me my TiVo), I started pondering stealing the plot gimmick (100 or so 'objects' with strange powers that people are trying to collect) for the ZoZ game I plan to start running for my 5 year-old in the New Year. (The plot gimmick is largely for my entertainment, mind you.)<br/><br/>I start mentally checklisting through "Fairy Tale Items" - Puss's Boots, the Princess's Pea, the Glass Slipper, Jack the Giant-Slayer's Belt, etc.  Then I start to ponder what could tie them all together and if there is any other reason than "joy of collecting" or "the lust for power" for ZoZ'ians to be try to "catch them all."<br/><br/>This morning I wonder if they all fell out of Santa's pack during that Fateful Year Without a Santa Claus a while back. <br/><br/>Any, mostly brainstorming here and wondering if you folks had any riffs on the subject.                </div>

<p>I haven't seen <em>The Lost Room</em>, but I'm reminded of the old <em>Friday the 13th: The TV Series</em> um... TV series.  Anyone remember that?  It must have been late 80's or early 90's.  I remeber watching it on my mom's old black &amp; white 12" Zenith while staying up past my bedtime.</p>
<p>Anyway, from what I remember, the hook revolved around this young couple that buys an old antique shop, fully stocked.  Turns out there's this multi-dimentional vault in the back where the previous owner had stored all sorts of dangerous artifacts.  Somehow the vault gets opened, the artifacts scattered, and it becomes up to the couple to retrieve all the objects and put them back in the vault.</p>
<p>The only episode I remember was the makeup box.  It was this old vaudeville-era stage makeup kit.  Using the makeup was like um... +6 Cha.  The wearer becomes extra attractive and likeable.  Problem is, the box is perpetually locked.  You have to soak it in fresh human blood to get it to open for you.  And, naturally, the effects of the makeup tend to wear off faster and faster.  Also naturally, the user becomes addicted to being pretty and popular and therefore becomes a mass murderer.</p>
<p>I imagine however you were to write up the collecting thing as a game, it could totally be an awesome lightweight episodic game.</p>

                            Yes, I remember <i>Friday the 13th: The TV Series</i> very well. We ran a mini-campaign that mixed that series and the Talamasca (from one Anne Rice's books...can't remember which one) back in the early 90's. Lots of fun, even using GURPS, which we did at the time.<br/><br/>If you want to find out more than anybody really needs to know about the show, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_The_Series" rel="nofollow">Friday the 13th at Wikipedia</a>. It has a pretty comprehensive list of the items they retrieved, and what the items did. <br/><br/>I remember catching an episode or two of that on TV within the last year. As is usually the case, I remember the show being better when I originally watched it. Still, probably lots of good fodder for a <i>Lost Room</i> kind of game. <br/><br/>I think the idea of giving the items a fairy tale spin is an excellent one. I'm also going to try to get my 6 year-old into a game of <i>Zo</i>, and include my wife if she'll go for it. I've been trying to think of a way to inject a few of his interests, which are mostly <i>PokÃ©mon</i> and <i>Naruto</i> at the moment. I think using fairytale macguffins might be a good way to go. <br/><br/>Tim                        </div>

                            I too am planning to include my wife - though maybe not every session.  <br/><br/>Part of the Collecting Thing comes from my son's interest in <i>Xiaolin Showdown</i>.<br/><br/>During a planeflight yesterday, I starting thinking about amalgamating some Fairy Tale (and children's show characters) with the Teen Titans as well.<br/><br/>I would be interested in hearing how your game goes, Tim.                        </div>

                            Tangential remarks:<br/><br/>* Friday 13th - ran briefly in the UK. I think the artefacts from the shop were satanic - created by the devil to spread badness. Team of, what, three trying to get them all back? I seem to remember it had some good points.<br/><br/>* It's not quite the same as Blue's idea, but I'm working on something (non-PDQ) at the moment where modern characters acquire the power items of mythic gods (Thor's hammer etc).<br/><br/>To be more helpful, two motivations suggest themselves: the original owners want them back, of course, and maybe the power of the realm itself fades without them in their proper places; OR just think what would happen if they fell into the wrong hands... or, perhaps, large grey-furred paws...                        </div>
