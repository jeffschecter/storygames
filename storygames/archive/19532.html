The Big Model is the theory that explains everything - and as such it explains nothing.  By the time you get to The Big Model you're at the point of saying "Different people play games for different reasons and that's cool."  Which is a great statement, possibly profound, but not terribly useful beyond itself.<br/><br/>GNS on the other hand is a fatally flawed taxonomy - mostly because one of these things is not like the other ones, one of these things doesn't belong.  Notably Simulationism is not, and has never been a creative agenda for roleplaying.  Simulationism is a method, and a method for a lot of things.  And deserves its own subcategories because few games, even Fiasco, don't try to simulate <em>something</em>.<br/><br/>So.  We have the Creative Agendas of the Game and the Narrative.  These are in tension.  (Not direct opposition; it's easy to mess both up at once, and some games are decent at both).  I'm now going to break both G and N down.<br/><br/>Gamism breaks down into tactical and strategic.  To illustrate the difference, a D&amp;D 4E Adventure Path is tactically incredibly gamist.  Each scene you do your way trying to win with style.  Strategically?  Working on that railroad however much elan, style, and panache you succeed with.  The same with e.g. Tomb of Horrors.  Each challenge is tactical, but the Tomb itself is do or die.  Gamism, I would say is about <a href="http://blog.perblue.com/2012/02/gamer-psychology-101-flow-vs-fiero.html" rel="nofollow">Fiero</a> - pride in overcoming challenges.  The Right To Dream is, ultimately, the strategic portion of gamism - otherwise known as the Sandbox.<br/><br/>Narrativism also breaks down into at least two categories.  I and We.  I is immersion, we is collaborative storytelling.  To pick one example, Fiasco is an amazing collaborative storytelling game - but is it immersive?  Not in my experience.  And this is a pretty critical distinction.<br/><br/>Finally there's simulationism.  And this too needs splitting.  Because, as I say, simulationism is a method and not an agenda.  There are two basic camps - process sim and outcome sim, or as I've been known to call them Deconstructive Simulation and Reconstructive Simulation.  Deconstructive simulation attempts to set rules for the actions, check they just about fit, and then let people go at it.  Most 80s games were deconstructive simulations - and you're going to end up with Supers games looking like The Authority or possibly Watchmen.  Reconstructive simulations are built on genre tropes as much as physics, and aren't normally afraid to fudge to get the outcomes that match the genre.  Fiasco and Monsterhearts are both textbook reconstructive simulations - and the recent D&amp;D edition war involves 3.X being deconstructive and 4E being a whole lot more reconstructive.<br/><br/>Am I on to anything here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434241/#Comment_434241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-23T19:12:11+00:00" title="June 23, 2014  7:12PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 5:42AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

There are different types of immersion. It's called <i>flow</i> when it's about system mastery. It's called <i>presence</i> if it's about loosing oneself in the setting. The effect of it all is the same: loosing sense of time and room, doing the task becomes an intrinsic reward, and your awareness and the task are merged together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434249/#Comment_434249" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T05:26:20+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  5:26AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...Simulationism is not, and has never been a creative agenda for roleplaying.</blockquote>\nExcept when it is?

I found this type of model compelling when I first encountered it, and I still do.  I can agree that simulation is not an "agenda", since there's nothing we do that doesn't involve simulation.  The closest might be something like "this <i>specific level of simulation</i> is my agenda for this particular game".  However the word "Simulationism" means more than "simulation".

I mean, you're saying that some things are creative agendas (or maybe categories of creative agendas), some other things aren't, and for all I know you might mean anything. Maybe you're right (trivially or otherwise), I don't know.<br/><br/>For comparison's sake, the Big Model (and GNS) concept of "Creative Agenda" gestures towards the underlying psychological purpose that is gratified by the creative activity. I'm hesitant to assume that you mean this when you say "Creative Agenda", as you started out by declaring the Big Model and GNS irrelevant, and I'm not really seeing you going to the mat about the substantial creative psychology of Simulationism, which makes me think that maybe you're using the terms in a different way.<br/><br/>In the context of traditional GNS discussion (which accepts the above notion of Creative Agenda, and further delves into analysis of agenda "modes" or "categories" that are theoretized to be involved in agenda incohesion) the idea that the agenda mode of Simulationism does not exist is not new; this used to be called the "Big Horseshoe" (as Jared Sorensen named it, I think) theory. It's generally a minority view among Forge theorists, possibly simply because being a "Forge theorist" (a rpg thinker who uses frameworks developed at the Forge) correlates with an orthodox understanding of the theory. Alternatively, it might be a minority view because it's wrong <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I have no idea if these old GNS discussions are relevant to your point (as I said, it basically depends on how you construe the very concept of "Creative Agenda"), but if they are, it might be interesting to note that the big fat central question about Simulationism denial relates to the true psycho-creative nature of Simulationistic play: given that we have play tentatively tagged as "Simulationistic" (this is not rare, many people have self-identified their play as such, myself included), does a cohesive creative psychology in fact underlie the activity, and is it essentially different from other agenda modes? If that psychology exists, does it display the property of incohesion with other priorities? Those who would "prove" that Simulationism exists need to convincingly establish that psychology, and show how it gives rise to coherent/incoherent play behaviors in practice; those who would show that Simulationism does not exist, on the other hand, need to successfully analyze such candidate Simulationistic observations with alternate explanations.<br/><br/>I again emphasize that the implied challenge in the above paragraph is old Forgite bullshit, doesn't need to concern you and your own rpg theory at all. Mostly it's your choice of aggressively Forgite terminology here that's getting old GNS theorists like yours truly to perk up and pay attention to what you're claiming <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434253/#Comment_434253" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T06:42:38+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  6:42AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I may poke in...I think that the way to "fix" GNS is to tackle the same subject matter through an entirely different lens.

I'm pretty sure this is one of the main reasons that Ron changed the terms for the Agendas to Right to Dream, Story Now, and Step On Up - so people would stop making assumptions about each of those modes based on the terms' regular, English meanings. <br/><br/>That makes these discussions difficult, since everyone involved might be working from a very different understanding of "the Model", and they're going to have trouble talking to each other. (For instance, the definition of the Right to Dream - Simulationism - appears to me to have absolutely *nothing* to do with "simulation" as a method we use in gaming. This means that if we talk about "simulation" as a method of play, we're almost certainly not talking about the Big Model as it's defined.)<br/><br/>As Eero says, the idea that "Simulationism doesn't exist" is a pretty old one (c.f. the Horseshoe Theory). It seems to me (as someone who wasn't intimate with the workings of the Forge) that this idea fell out of fashion after a time, as Right to Dream became better defined and more people self-identified their games as belonging to that Agenda (e.g. Eero, above). I know there were still a few adherents to the Horseshoe theory by the end of the Forge, but my completely unscientific sense is that most people found the developing conversation around that Agenda compelling, and they were fewer and fewer Horseshoe-supporters.<br/><br/>Ron's definition of it certainly became clearer with time, and someone feeling an interest in understanding, redefining, or refuting that aspect of the Model should probably start by reading the later discussions around the Right to Dream, to see whether they would also fall into the camp of Horseshoe supporters or not. <br/><br/>(It <i>is</i> worth noting that Ron defined the Right to Dream to operate slightly differently from the other two Agendas, due to a focus on Exploration being at the basis of pay. So he might agree that these three modes are slightly different from each other in quality.)<br/><br/>From a design standpoint, it's hard to explain games like <i>Fiasco</i> or Tod's <i>Watch the World Die</i> without referring to support for *some kind* of an Agenda which is pretty definitely not Story Now or Step On Up, unless we <i>really</i> stretch the definitions of those terms.<br/><br/>As for breaking down the existing Agendas into sub-categories, I'm pretty sure that was always fairly legit - all my recollections of Big Model theory include people talking about a great variety of, e.g., Step On Up agendas or Story Now agendas, there being an infinite variety there, just loosely being grouped into those three camps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434261/#Comment_434261" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T09:29:42+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  9:29AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all - the first post was rambling because I was groping at something I hadn't quite been able to express clearly even to myself but I knew was there.  (If this one rambles it's because I'm figuring it out - but I think it now has a clear thesis).<br/><br/>First, I'm in no way saying that the right to dream isn't perfectly legitmate.  I'm saying it's on a different axis to G and N.  And MDA appears to be something I was groping towards but slightly differently.<br/><br/>To put it simply, GNS is missing an entire creative agenda, and the agenda that is the counterpart to much of Simulationism in the same way that G and N are counterparts.  Immersion.  The Right to Be.  And Immersion is definitely a creative agenda.<br/><br/>It is also distinct from the other three - it <em>definitely</em> isn't Story Now.  Fiasco is, in many ways anti-immersive even while being an amazing narrative game.  On the other hand Grey Ranks and Montsegur 1244 are both immersive and very story focussed, while definitely not allowing you to change the overall course of events.  So we've shown that Immersion is orthogonal to N - an N game can be immersive and can be anti-immersive.  I can do the same with G fairly easily based on oD&amp;D playstyles.  <br/><br/>Of course with Immersion in there we need to break Simulationism a little.  Simulationism thus becomes the Right to Know or the Right to Understand - with the Right to Dream being separate interactions between S and G and S and N.<br/><br/>And people play for pure immersion.  We especially see it on online RP servers where you have people that show up and play as crafters without engaging most of the rest of the content.  They just want to be there being someone else in that world.<br/><br/>I'm now going to bring in what's the only actual mass survey I know.  <a href="http://www.seankreynolds.com/rpgfiles/gaming/BreakdownOfRPGPlayers.html" rel="nofollow">Wizards of the Coast's very old one</a> (Robin Laws' Gamer Types map closely to this).  What Wizards called Combat Focussed I'm going to call Challenge Focussed - i.e. Gamist.  (It's simply that D&amp;D's main mode of challenge is, and has always been the combat).  The Right to Dream is the right to change things.  It's a strategic focus.  Narrowing down the perspective to exactly where you are is a tactical focus.  Which is why the character actors go in the lower right - classical immersion/bleed.  I'm claiming strong correlation here.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.seankreynolds.com/rpgfiles/gaming/BreakdownOfRPGPlayers.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434264/#Comment_434264" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T09:36:28+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  9:36AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 9:45AM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Simulationism is a method, and a method for a lot of things.

The first part is actually accurate, Simulationism is a method. The example is the thing that ruins it, because Fiasco is trying to simulate a Coen brothers movie. Think of it like this: not only "physics" for this and that can be simulated, you can also mess with the mathematical probabilities of certain events happening, to make the fiction nearly similar to the works of any author. This makes story games a simulation too.<br/><br/>But then again, Simulation isn't the goal, it's the name of the method we will use to build a fiction. Immersion on the act of using tools provided by a game to apply the method, instead of immersing in the fiction is what Gamism is oriented to. Immersion on the resulting fiction instead of going into the details of the method is what story now is about. Both are a bit away from, let's call it, "pure story games", where the method goes more around a collective dramaturgy/literary method to create a fiction. But there are not many "pure story games" since most designers come from trad gaming in one way or another and introduce story-now tools along with single character ownership or separate author stances, etc to create a rich uncategorizable hybrid.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434265/#Comment_434265" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T09:37:50+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  9:37AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 9:39AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (As a sidenote, I'm always shocked when I see people refer to <i>Fiasco</i> as a Narrativism-supporting game.

"Address" means:<br/><br/>-Establishing the issue's Explorative expressions in the game-world, "fixing" them into imaginary place.<br/><br/>-Developing the issue as a source of continued conflict, perhaps changing any number of things about it, such as which side is being taken by a given character, or providing more depth to why the antagonistic side of the issue exists at all.<br/><br/>-Resolving the issue through the decisions of the players of the protagonists, as well as various features and constraints of the circumstances.<br/><br/>Can it really be that easy? Yes, Narrativism is that easy. The Now refers to the people, during actual play, focusing their imagination to create those emotional moments of decision-making and action, and paying attention to one another as they do it. To do that, they relate to "the story" very much as authors do for novels, as playwrights do for plays, and screenwriters do for film at the creative moment or moments. Think of the Now as meaning, "in the moment," or "engaged in doing it," in terms of input and emotional feedback among one another. The Now also means "get to it," in which "it" refers to any Explorative element or combination of elements that increases the enjoyment of that issue I'm talking about.<br/><br/>There cannot be any "the story" during Narrativist play, because to have such a thing (fixed plot or pre-agreed theme) is to remove the whole point: the creative moments of addressing the issue(s). Story Now has a great deal in common with Step On Up, particularly in the social expectation to contribute, but in this case the real people's attention is directed toward one another's insights toward the issue, rather than toward strategy and guts. </i><br/><br/>By the definition, Fiasco is somewhat story now in spirit, though most of it's mechanics create some randomization on the outcomes and players can affect them only to make it worse. Embracing a random bad outcome and "roleplaying" it isn't the same as "addressing" it in the way the definition here says.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434275/#Comment_434275" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T10:11:01+00:00" title="June 24, 2014 10:11AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 1:03PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not convinced that immersion is a creative agenda.

That used to be a question as well, whether there is a creative agenda of immersion. I'm a moderate on the matter myself in that I'm not convinced either way; on the one hand the concept of "immersion" is so abused and disparate that it is very difficult to discuss, and on the other hand the biggest proponents of immersive play have historically been (due to various accidents of social history) not very well versed in Forgite theory. It's pretty much a fact that people bring their A-game when it comes to things that interest them, and immersive play in the sense that most resembles a Creative Agenda has been a big interest for only few Forgites over the years.<br/><br/>The orthodox take on the matter tends to be that "immersion" is a technical shibboleth for "we're having fun". Rickard exemplifies this pretty well upthread, in fact, as he explains what he understands by the term - he's basically saying that immersion is nothing more than the mere subjective experience of grokking a game and being thoroughly entertained by engaging in it. In this sense immersion is no creative agenda, it's just a certain rpg subculture's favoured way of saying "cohesive and fun game".<br/><br/>However, as I indicated above, I'm not personally entirely convinced that this is the whole of the truth. I'm no immersion man myself, truly, but I know immersion-oriented gamers enough to find it credible that there are at least some people into roleplaying whose behaviour consistently supports the idea of Immersionism. It's a bit difficult to know for sure because of how the creative agenda is most viably observable in personal practice, of course; I would have to experience immersionist play myself and discover it different from the other agenda modes to know for sure.<br/><br/>Were Immersionism a creative agenda mode in the sense of orthodox GNS theory, we would expect the following to be true about it:<br/><b>*</b> There's at least a somewhat credible model of creative psychology, even a vague one, that explains what an Immersionist agenda <i>is</i>.<br/><b>*</b> There's a body of actual play history that can be successfully analysed and explained with the help of the concept. (If this does not exist, we basically have a hypothetical phenomenon that does not apparently exist in the real world, even if somebody would like it to.)<br/><b>*</b> The creative value that immersion brings in a play situation coheres socially (that is, the players affirm each other's immersive enjoyment) while engaging with it is incompatible with engaging other agenda modes. (Failing this condition would indicate that whatever immersionism were, it would not be an agenda mode. Could still be a certain category or context for creative agenda without being a mode, of course.)<br/><br/>Historically the biggest stumbling block for the agenda mode of Immersionism has been the difficulty of defining it analytically in a way that doesn't boil down to the definition of Simulationism. Generally speaking the core play experience and culture around immersion (considering e.g. Nordic immersionism, an entire school or tradition of roleplaying that revolves around character immersion) tends to discuss play in ways that certainly make the Simulationist characterization credible. This would make "Immersionism" a specific culturally bounded ideal type of Simulationism - a sort of non-functional (in terms of play cohesion) subcategory, if you will.<br/><br/>Regarding Big Model theory context, I should note that the idea of a fourth agenda mode such as Immersionism is not difficult for any sort of structural reasons. I can see how a superficial look at the theory might give one the impression that there are three agenda modes because three is a magic number, but that is not - or should not be - the case: there are an infinite variety of creative agendas, which fall into a number of agenda modes, and we only know of those modes from observing play and understanding the creative agendas driving it. It would be unjustified dogmatism to decide that we absolutely and definitely understand all there is to understand about the creative priorities that the medium of roleplaying makes possible. Show the work, define well, and I can't see why one wouldn't accept more agenda modes.<br/><br/>(If I had to put money on it, I would gamble that a "new" agenda mode will likely be discovered by further analysis of the very idea of agenda modalities, rather than by naming and staking claim to some heretofore ignored type of roleplaying. Remember that the whole notion of "agenda mode" only makes sense in the context of cohesive and incohesive play priorities observed in cycles of play, which could well stand closer observation and analysis at this point.)<br/><br/>I should clarify, though, that things such as this Immersionism question have very little to do with territory-claiming: it is not the case that we somehow have to "split up Simulationism" to acknowledge/discover/understand a hypothetical new Creative Agenda mode. I know that the history of the discourse has a lot of bad habits, but properly speaking you can't reliably do GNS analysis by exclusive deduction: it is not the case that gameplay case A has to be Sim because it's not Nar or Gam, for example. Relying on such exclusive logic without any positive observations to affirm the supposition makes one effectively blind to the possibility of play that does not exemplify any of those three agenda modes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434282/#Comment_434282" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T10:26:53+00:00" title="June 24, 2014 10:26AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">@Neonchameleon</a>: you should probably <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134842/personality_and_play_styles_a_.php?page=1" rel="nofollow">check out this article</a>, which does what <a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a> suggested: to look at other models to see what they have in common.

That's the same selection bias that has plagued GNS discussions for years. People familiar with only one mode of play have a really hard time grokking other kinds of play. And I'm not limiting that to understanding different Creative Agenda (in the broad, three kinds of CA sense); that also applies to people who typically know one specific kind of Right to Dream play and don't recognize other kinds of RtD play as RtD (for example, deep-sim D&amp;D players not recognizing Fiasco play as another kind of RtD). <br/><br/>In the end, these things are just categories that are not particularly useful. Once you find yourself having regular games that are going well, you don't need CA. Even as a designer, you might not really think much about CA. You'll spend more time at the Techniques level and CA will be there only subconsciously, or it'll occasionally raise its head when you're analyzing actual play from playtesting. <br/><br/>But I love Big Model discussions, so let's dig in. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434296/#Comment_434296" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T13:59:40+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  1:59PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 2:42PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point, <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>.  Creating taxonomical structures is fun (and for website developers it can be reasonably lucrative), but we must remember that IRL CATEGORIES DO NOT EXIST.  And even if we take them as real, we are currently in a room full of people dedicated to the continual advancement of the art of creating things that cannot easily be categorized.<br/><br/>The lack of a category doesn't stop an artist.  It stops a marketer.<br/><br/>Some people wear their Creative Agenda on the front of their T-Shirt.  For others the CA is something that emerges in the act of producing a work, or a body of work.  Either way, it will probably change from time to time over the course of your life.  So after we're all dead, let's have a discussion about what our Creative Agendas all turned out to be.  I'll pour the first round.<br/><br/>ETA: That said, I do like that chart.  But it should be a circle.  :-)  I wonder if we could take that chart and progress each of the quadrants outward until we reached the levels of specific elements, like techniques, moves, customs, assumptions, mechanics, etc.  It might then be used for mapping and comparing specific game systems visually.  Which pragmatically speaking is a pointless activity, yet geekishly compelling.  We could see which games look like little clusters of nearby elements, and which are more like big star-shaped networks spanning the chart.  After mapping a bunch of games this way, we might have a better idea of how to talk about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434301/#Comment_434301" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T16:05:36+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  4:05PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a GM I've found that having a clear creative agenda on my mind helps me GM better.

Rather, I believe it's due to people's tastes, expectations and ingrained creative priorities\u2026 Especially their expectations re: film and cinema.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
