I thought it might be useful for Sage and Adam (and perhaps others) if I broke down my setup and how things went. I'm hoping that some of you who were in the game will chime in with your feedback.  This will probably run long, so apologies in advance for that.<br/><br/>The game was myself and six players, using all the character classes except the Bard, which I left out. As we started character creation I explained that they would be starting in the "Great Abysmal Swamp" through which they'd journeyed to reach the Sunken Tower, last remnant of an ancient civilization. I left why they were there for them to sort out.<br/><br/>In preparing for the game, I went quite a bit beyond what I needed for a one-shot con game. I created a Dungeon Front according to the latest rules draft I had (version 11.02.06). I had the basic idea for the dungeon already in mind, and used the fronts to help make things more concrete. I was surprised by how well the fixed options worked for what I had in mind.<br/><br/>DANGERS<br/>Horde - Cavern Dwellers (impulse: defend against outsiders; Moves: display a show of dominance; grow by conquest)<br/>Cursed Place - Abandoned Tower (impulse; draw in the weak-willed; Moves: confuse or obfuscate truth or direction)<br/>Arcane Enemy - Sentient Artifact (impulse: find a worthy wielder; Moves: recruit follower, attack with magic)<br/><br/>IMPENDING DOOM<br/>An evil competitor (a mind flayer in this case) ascends in power, using the PCs failures as a means to claim the artifact<br/><br/>GRIM PORTENTS<br/>The creatures of the dungeon do not dwell here naturally, but have been drawn here<br/>The tower is not a natural ruin, but a thing alive, wanting<br/>The heroes are tested and rewarded (by the tower/artifact) when they survive<br/>As the PCs fail, the mind flayer uses them to grow more powerful<br/><br/>So essentially I was imagining an ancient tower, sunken into the swamps, with dungeons below it. HIdden in those dungeons was an artifact with power enough to make the tower a living thing. It called to sentient creatures, summoning them, challenging them. It wants to find the most powerful being it can, so that it can be freed.  All the other dungeon dwellers are simply here guarding it against others until they can claim it for themselves. The most powerful of those was supposed to be a Lovecraftian-styled mind flayer.<br/><br/>I put together a rough sketch of eight different monsters they might encounter and drew out a rough diagram of how the encounters and other interesting dungeon features might be connected. I steered clear of creating an actual dungeon map because I wanted to maintain some flexibility. As it turns out, they met five of the eight monsters and covered maybe two-thirds of what I had prepped. <br/><br/>Back to the character creation. In preparation for this adventure, I decided that some of the players were going to get shafted based on the classes they chose. I made some substitutions for several classes to keep things interesting:<br/><br/>Ranger - once they leave the swamp and enter a dungeon full of traps and undead, most of the ranger moves dry up. I gave her an extra 5 gp to pick up more equipment.<br/>Paladin - a mount isn't much good in the swamp or the dungeon, so I had him take a minion (level 1, 8 hp, 1 armor, 3 damage) instead.<br/>Wizard - I had him take an extra move, <i>Eidetic Memory</i>, just to make sure there was plenty of fun spell-casting. in retrospect, probably not necessary.<br/><br/><br/>In addition, I told them that we'd be using 5xp as the base for advancement, rather than 10, just to make sure it happened in a con game. Later we also decided to keep it at 5 (instead of doubling it), which let some folks get to third level before the end. It was fun, but obviously not fit for a long-term game.<br/><br/>THE CHARACTERS:<br/>Malle, Human Paladin<br/>Oden, Dwarf Cleric<br/>Ragnar, Dwarf Fighter<br/>Aldo, Human Thief<br/>Finnan, Elf Wizard<br/>Adelais, Human Ranger<br/><br/>Many of the bonds were great, and useful in setting up the relationships and driving play, but were probably not as useful as they would be for a long-term game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315404/#Comment_315404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T20:14:45+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  8:14PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play started with the PCs in the swamp, approaching the tower. They made some knowledge moves and discovered the Lizard people ambush set for them. There was a lengthy fight, a map was drawn, and I wrestled a bit with turn order and making moves as the DM. Several of the players had had previous experience with Apocalypse World, so we debated a bit about the best ways to proceed. In the end we settled on a clockwise rotation with DM moves resulting from failures for the most part. I should probably have made sure harm was happening all the time (announcing "they're throwing spears" and then doing Harm to whichever characters don't actively Dodge or whatever). It worked out, but they took less damage than they might have.<br/><br/>CUSTOM MOVE: <br/><b>When you are poisoned by the LIzard People</b> (bite, spit), roll+Con. On a 10+, your blood burns, but you bear the pain. On a 7-9, take 2 hp now and 1hp each round for three rounds. On a miss, take 4hp now and 2hp each round for three rounds. <br/><br/>After this fight, they interrogated a prisoner, fought amongst themselves about executing him, scouted the area and found signs of the flying "horned horrors" that live in the tower top. They used planning and a lizard man net to capture a peryton and kill it. Then they decided against climbing the tower and found a filthy hole to crawl into instead.<br/><br/>They discovered an ancient throne room of some sort, and narrowly avoided a monster/trap involving a swarm of dormant, hungry, flesh-eating bugs. They found a flaming sword, and continued to draw supernatural attention to themselves with their magic. The tower shook, cutting off their escape and driving them in further.<br/><br/>At this point we'd spent an hour making characters and an hour on our first fight with the lizard men;  another hour on taking a break, doing investigation and planning, and killing the peryton. In the final hour of the session, I culled a number of things off of my list, and changed the Big Bad from the mind flayer to something more interesting for the time we had. <br/><br/>The last encounter was with a water spirit in the flooded dungeons below the tower. Their path required them to go through the water, but they wisely balked at that, and soon discovered that the spirit had a collection of previous adventurers as its undead thralls. The cleric turned some of the zombies and the paladin set others on fire with his new flaming sword. The fighter found himself ringed in zombies while the Ranger shot at them, her cougar "Peaches" tearing at their waterlogged flesh. The wizard used his new moves to hammer the water with magic missiles and the thief used oil to set everything else on fire. It was a giant, victorious mess in the last few minutes of the session.<br/><br/>Overall, the game was fun for me, and for my friend Paul, who had joined me for the con. He's the oldest of old school, having played plenty of 2nd edition D&amp;D with me back in the day, but nothing lately. He had a great time. I think it was fun for everybody else, but I'll let them speak for themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315405/#Comment_315405" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T20:15:33+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  8:15PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2011 9:06PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few final notes and suggestions. Again, hopefully others will speak up as well.<br/><br/>Hack and Slash with a bow felt unsatisfying when the roll was 7-9. How should the PC take damage when the monster was at range? We decided that when no PC damage was possible, a 7-9 resulted in the bow attack doing only half-damage to the enemy.<br/><br/>The Pull a Stunt move was missing from this version, and missed. There aren't any rules in the system at the moment for unusual, tricky moves. One example was the Thief using his equipment list to throw flaming oil- it felt like he should roll, but we weren't sure how.<br/><br/>The Ranger's moves are a little one-note at the moment, resulting in a character that feels ineffective outside of a natural environment. Perhaps mix up the animal companion moves with others, possibly giving a choice at the start. A "re-roll" move might be very nice for the ranger, going along with the flexible, survivor vibe the class has.<br/><br/>There isn't a lot of guidance about monster creation at the moment, at least in terms of balance.  For example, how many level 1 creatures should be a good match against a party of six level 1 PCs?  Should that fight be easier or harder than a single level 3 monster?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315407/#Comment_315407" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T20:44:58+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  8:44PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, thanks for running this for us!<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt like I was 15 years old again playing RPGs for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bonds were solid and helped drive roleplaying. I felt we were much more of a team than many other "team based" games I've played at conventions. Although we were also surrounded by excellent players. The bonds seemed more effective to me than HX in Apocalypse World when I've played. They were much more colorful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad we settled on taking turns rotating clockwise. So many Moves snowball into other Moves, unchecked, it's easy for a player to keep rolling Moves way past their allotted time in the spotlight. I know given the chance I could keep rolling and rolling!<br/>\n<br/>\n1/2 damage from a 7-9 result in range combat sounds fair to me. A few of my cleric spells worked that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only aspect of the game that was unclear to me was how to treat damage or the threat of attacks. In a giant back and forth battle, should we be frequently dodging? It seemed like we got off a little easy in the fight with the lizard people.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeveling up was great fun. I loved the bonus XP for playing to your alignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite parts:<br/>\n<br/>\n- doing jumping jacks to get my heart pumping to attract the heart eating demon to attack me triggering our trap!<br/>\n<br/>\n- the ranger using her arrows to mark the enemies her animal companion should attack\u2026 it was a twisted version of "catch".<br/>\n<br/>\n- the word, enemies, and especially the temple felt very evocative\u2026 I was immersed!<br/>\n<br/>\n- stealing Ralph's XP!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315426/#Comment_315426" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T02:17:57+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  2:17AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great, Steve.

Worship involved suffering, so John was constantly putting himself in harm's way. When he put himself between the Paladin and the lizard man he was executing (Avenger), he took a flail to the head (8 hp of damage!) and the creature got away.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315442/#Comment_315442" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T06:36:26+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  6:36AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He deserved it.<br><br>I had much fun in the game.  It definitely fills a bit of a sweet spot for nostalgic old school feel without the huge time investment I remember from back in the day.<br><br>The couple of "red flag" items that came up for me (I call them red flags rather than problems because 1 con session isn't enough to determine exactly what they are, only that if I were the designer I'd be investigating further)<br><br>1) I'm not entirely sure that the way fighting works in AW can effectively map to a dungeon crawl.  In AW every death has its meaning.  The MC is instructed to view NPCs through crosshairs because it isn't about "can you kill this guy" but "what kind of shit storm do you kick up when you do".  In a dungeon crawl...it IS about the can and the how...and there really isn't much of a shit storm of consequence for killing a few evil lizard men in a swamp...not like when you snipe a scary chick who just happens to be Tum Tum's favorite assassin.<br><br>2) I think how damage works needs to be spelled out a lot more.  If the game is going to use the only-players-roll model of making moves, then the baddies actually have to DO stuff.  I'm thinking that any time any PC was in a "threatening or exposed" position, on their next turn they take damage.  Period.  UNLESS they pulled one of the moves (like Hack and Slash, Dodge, or Defend) that allows them to avoid the damage on a suitable roll.  If the consequence for a medium result on a helping roll is to leave the character "exposed" and that character does anything else on their next turn other than the above moves, then they eat the damage automatically.  There were a couple of "announce future badness" in the game in the form of incoming thrown spears, but I don't recall anyone actually getting hit...at least not very often.  <br><br>Which may well be fine for a con game.  As it is, if we were all being extra cautious about avoiding damage we probably wouldn't have gotten as far in the adventure as we did.  But one of the prime tensions of an old school dungeon crawl is the risk of death, and a con game with disposable characters is a great time to really risk that.  That part was missing from the session, since I think the closest anyone got to death was the Cleric...from my attack when I bashed him for robbing me of an XP when he interfered with my "Deny mercy to an unbeliever" Alignment move.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315454/#Comment_315454" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T08:32:25+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  8:32AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great feedback, Ralph.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315468/#Comment_315468" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T10:26:18+00:00" title="March  4, 2011 10:26AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2011 10:29AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I'm thinking that any time any PC was in a "threatening or exposed" position, on their next turn they take damage.

That'll give the Ranger something to do in a dungeon, too.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315484/#Comment_315484" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T13:14:06+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  1:14PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>As I recall, that's a thief ability.

I meant that to read "Daniel seemed ready with his thief move, so his character was probably evil." there was evil enough in the dungeon for the Paladin, I think.<br><br>I liked that your dude was top on crafting that net trap, and successfully negated the threat of the bug/trap in the throne room. It's nice to see strategy and skill used as a solution as often as violence. If the moves don't allow for that kind of creativity, they'll have to be adjusted.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315516/#Comment_315516" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T16:19:34+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  4:19PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that sounds fantastic! I love hearing about a good game AND hearing ways it could have been better.<br><br>First off, the catch-all move: It's coming back. Also, we broke down and made Melee and Ranged different moves, so that they can feel like they work differently (and work in a concept of ammo where it fits). I *think* we finally have a solid set of basic moves, but then again I think that every time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The ranger is probably the class most likely to be revised. We recently had one in a session and hit some of the same things. Did the Ranger's bonds feel less grabby than other classes? That's something that we found recently.<br/><br/>Ralph, those are some really useful red flags. On the first comment, I feel like DW still is about can and how, it just isn't about those things in the same way. You still have to do something to kill those lizardmen, and that thing has consequences.<br/><br/>The second comment is something we've been looking at, and I think adding the catch-all Act Under Fire move will actually help. It sounds like the root issue is that sometimes it's hard to do anything with those impending spears, but if those impending spears mean you have to Act Under Fire (not the final name, btw), then it makes more sense. That way if you're trying to Spout Lore in a fight, that has consequences.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks so much everyone for playing, and for all the useful feedback!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315518/#Comment_315518" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T17:01:07+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  5:01PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>The ranger is probably the class most likely to be revised.</blockquote> This sentence works for almost any fantasy rpg you might be discussing.  Any edition. ;-)<br/><br/>I haven't played DW yet (soon!), but I think whatever solutions you come up with for combat should aim towards having heroes get hit/hurt a lot, but then have generous death rules and healing.<br/><br/>This makes combats *seem* even more dangerous than they might actually be, with heroes going down and then bouncing back for more.  This is something I feel 4E got pretty right, at the low levels at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315809/#Comment_315809" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T20:00:11+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  8:00PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!  Sorry for slow response.  I played Finn\xe1n the Elven Wizard.  I agree with all the other feedback regarding mechanical stuff, and want to add one more: leveling up should not get slower with time!  There's no reason to go 10/20/30 or whatever it is now.  It's not like you're getting more XP as you level up.  And with XP/leveling the only source of mechanical advancement  (short of magic items I guess), I wouldn't want it withheld from me more and more as the game progressed.  At most make it slightly slower, like 10/11/12/13/etc.<br/><br/>I also want to find out more about how Bonds evolve over time, since Hx's evolution works great in AW, and I think it may be even better in DW since they are named for specific events.<br/><br/>But most of all...<br/><br/>I WANT TO PLAY A FULL CAMPAIGN OF THIS RIGHT NAO!!!!!!<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
